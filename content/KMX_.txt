carmax was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax store in richmond virginia on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company as of february 28 2022 we operated 230 used car stores in 107 us television markets our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

on june 1 2021 we completed the acquisition of edmunds holding company “edmunds” one of the most well established and trusted online guides for automotive information and a recognized leader in digital car shopping innovations with this acquisition carmax has enhanced its digital capabilities and further strengthened its role and reach across the used auto ecosystem while adding exceptional technology and creative talent 

impact of covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 as a global pandemic throughout fiscal 2021 many us states and localities had shelterinplace orders and occupancy restrictions impacting the operations of our stores and consumer demand as a result our fiscal 2021 results were significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic primarily during the first quarter 

although the effects of covid19 seem to have subsided uncertainty continues during fiscal 2022 states and localities conducted vaccine distribution programs and eased certain statemandated restrictions however the continued spread and impact of covid19 persists particularly as it relates to the emergence of new variants of the virus we continue to actively monitor developments that may cause us to take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates customers communities and shareholders for further discussion of the impacts of covid19 on our business and fiscal 2022 results refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

carmax business 

we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax our consolidated financial statements include the financial results related to our edmunds business which does not meet the definition of a reportable segment 

carmax sales operations our carmax sales operations segment sells used vehicles purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources sells related products and services and arranges financing options for customers all for competitive nohaggle prices we enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer 

purchasing a vehicle  

the vehicle purchase process at carmax differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience our nohaggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for other consumer products our omnichannel platform further empowers our customers to buy a car on their own terms – online instore or a seamless combination of both customers can choose to complete the carbuying experience inperson at one of our stores or buy the car online and receive delivery through express pickup available nationwide or home delivery available to most customers 

our omnichannel platform provides multiple ways for our customers to interact with us including completely online a customer may interact with our customer experience consultants via phone text messages or chat these employees are paid a fixed hourly rate and receive incentive bonuses based on their ability to effectively progress the customer through their carbuying journey customers may also interact inperson with our sales consultants who are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate these pay structures align our associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

we recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our carmax quality certified standards and each vehicle must pass an inspection before being offered for sale we stand behind every used vehicle we sell with our love your car guarantee this guarantee gives customers the ability to take 24hour test drives before committing to purchase as well as provides a 30day1500 mile moneyback guarantee and a 90day4000mile limited warranty our carmax quality certified standards were developed internally by carmax and are not affiliated with any third party or original equipment manufacturer program 

we maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory available for viewing on carmaxcom as well as our mobile app as of february 28 2022 we had approximately 71000 saleable retail vehicles in our inventory vehicles intransit or on customer hold are not visible on our website upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our inventory this gives carmax customers access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer in fiscal 2022 approximately 36 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request 

in addition to retailing used vehicles we sold new vehicles under franchise agreements at one location during fiscal 2022 during the third quarter we sold this new car franchise and no longer sell new vehicles 

selling us a vehicle  

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a customer’s vehicle inperson free of charge and make a written guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us this nohaggle offer is good for seven days we also provide online instant appraisal offers which quickly give customers an offer on their vehicle the success of these offerings strengthens our leadership position as the largest used vehicle buyer from consumers in the us 

based on age mileage or condition approximately half of the vehicles acquired through our appraisal processes meet our retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers in response to the covid19 pandemic we moved our auctions previously held at many of our stores to an online platform during fiscal 2021 those auctions continued to be conducted virtually throughout fiscal 2022 as of february 28 2022 our average auction sales rate was approximately 95 

financing a vehicle  

the availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process and having an array of finance sources increases approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax our finance program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both caf and thirdparty providers we believe that our processes and systems transparency of pricing and vehicle quality as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit enable caf and our thirdparty providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment all finance offers whether from caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge 

our online checkout process includes a financing offer product which allows eligible customers to apply and accept finance offers without needing the assistance of an associate to submit a credit application over the phone or in store we also provide a financebased shopping capability to the majority of our customers which enables them to see personalized finance terms from multiple lenders across the full inventory of vehicles on our website we continue to enhance and further expand these products 

related products and services  

we provide customers with a range of other related products and services including extended protection plan “epp” products and vehicle repair service epp products include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” which is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business in fiscal 2022 approximately 60 of the customers who purchased a retail used vehicle also purchased an esp and approximately 20 purchased gap 

carmax auto finance caf provides financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history and other credit data of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely to carmax customers our scoring models are optimized for the carmax channel we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 426 of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2022 

caf also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements collecting payments maintaining contact with delinquent customers and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans 

competition 

carmax sales operations the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and we face competition from franchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles online sellers independent used car dealers and private parties according to industry sources as of december 31 2021 there were over 18000 franchised dealers in the us who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles competition in our industry has evolved with the adoption of online platforms and marketing tools all of which facilitate increased competition 

based on industry data there were approximately 42 million used cars sold in the us in calendar 2021 of which approximately 23 million were estimated to be age 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us in calendar 2021 we estimate we sold approximately 40 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold on a nationwide basis an increase from 35 in calendar 2020 we estimate we sold approximately 49 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate in calendar 2021 an increase from 43 in 2020 our market share is generally correlated to the length of time we have operated in a given market 

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our competitive nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems the transparency and availability of caf and thirdparty financing the locations of our retail stores and our commitment to evolving our carbuying experience to meet customers’ changing expectations we believe our omnichannel platform reinforces our competitive advantages as it empowers customers to buy a car on their own terms whether completely from home instore or through a seamlessly integrated combination of online and instore experiences our diversified business model combined with our omnichannel experience is a unique advantage in the used car industry that firmly positions us to continue growing our market share while creating shareholder value over the longterm 

in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our high volume of appraisal purchases which has increased further with the rollout of our instant appraisal offers supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards 

our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive inperson and online auctions these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax’s auctions predominantly sell older higher mileage vehicles during fiscal 2021 in response to the impacts of covid19 we quickly transitioned our wholesale auctions to an online platform and they continued to be 

conducted virtually throughout fiscal 2022 when we restart inperson auction operations we expect to continue to use online wholesale technology by moving to simulcast auctions 

carmax auto finance caf operates and is a significant participant in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies according to industry sources this sector represented more than 1 trillion in outstanding receivables as of december 31 2021 caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars 

we believe that caf’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source for carmax customers and that caf’s primary driver for growth is the growth in carmax’s retail used unit sales we periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness we also monitor 3day payoffs as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our offer 

products and services 

retail merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including domestic imported and luxury vehicles as well as hybrid and electric vehicles at competitive prices our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old these vehicles have historically ranged in price from 11000 to 37000 but in the past year generally ranged in price from 14000 to 47000 due to higher vehicle acquisition costs driven by market appreciation the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences seasonality and market pricing and availability 

wholesale auctions the typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase our auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis 

extended protection plans in conjunction with the sale of a vehicle we offer customers epp products we receive revenue for selling these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors we have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements the esps we currently offer on all used retail vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract the epps that we sell have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements periodically we may receive profitsharing revenues based upon the performance of the esp policies administered by third parties as of february 28 2022 our thirdparty esp providers included assurant inc cna national warranty corporation and fidelity warranty services inc our thirdparty gap provider as of february 28 2022 was safeguard products international llc 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our internal standards before it can become a carmax quality certified vehicle this process includes an inspection of the engine and all major systems based on this inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our internal quality standards many of our stores depend upon nearby typically larger carmax stores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services including but not limited to services related to manufacturer’s warranties we engage third parties specializing in those services carmax does not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs and some vehicles carmax sells may have unrepaired safety recalls however safety recall information as reported by the national highway traffic safety administration is available on our website and we review any unrepaired safety recall information with our used vehicle customers before purchase 

all carmax used car stores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by the esps we sell additionally we have partnered with thirdparty providers of auto service and repair through these partnerships our customers have access to a nationwide network of trusted quality and fairpriced service and repair locations 

customer credit we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and arrangements with several financial institutions vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicle as of february 28 2022 our thirdparty finance providers included ally financial american credit acceptance capital one auto finance chase auto finance exeter finance corp santander consumer usa and westlake financial 

services we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged and held by thirdparty providers and we periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

generally credit applications submitted by customers to carmax are initially reviewed by caf using our proprietary underwriting standards based on that review caf makes financing offers designed to create a loan portfolio that meets our targeted risk profile in the aggregate applications that caf declines or approves with conditions are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers thirdparty providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we refer to the providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as tier 3 providers we are willing to pay a fee to tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that they may not otherwise be able to obtain all fees either received or paid are prenegotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount financed the interest rate the term of the loan or the loantovalue ratio caf also provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a tier 2 or tier 3 provider 

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

suppliers for used vehicles 

we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our instore and online appraisal processes as well as through local regional and online auctions while in any individual period conditions may vary historically our annual selfsufficiency rate has been between 36 and 41 during fiscal 2022 we achieved a record selfsufficiency rate of approximately 70 driven primarily by our new online instant appraisal offer programs the buy rate for customers who engage with us after first receiving an online instant appraisal offer is typically higher than through our traditional appraisal lane we also acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market 

the supply of latemodel used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the volume of new vehicle sales which in turn generate used car tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry sources there were approximately 284 million light vehicles in operation in the us as of december 31 2021 during calendar year 2021 it is estimated that approximately 15 million new cars and 42 million used cars were sold at retail many of which were accompanied by tradeins and more than 13 million wholesale vehicles were sold at auctions and through other channels 

based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year consumer acceptance of our appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

seasonality 

historically our business has been seasonal our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer with an increase in traffic and sales in february and march coinciding with federal income tax refunds sales are typically slowest in the fall in fiscal 2021 and 2022 traffic and sales were impacted by the covid19 pandemic and it remains unclear how the continuing impact of covid19 and related federal payments will affect the seasonality of our business 

technology 

we leverage a combination of cloudbased solutions and proprietary technologies to run our operations we have a strong software engineering discipline and we have adopted agile devops lean and other leading digital delivery practices technology teams are tightly integrated with the rest of the business and are embedded within our crossfunctional “product” teams our product teams use a “test and learn” approach to iterate and deploy new technologyenabled experiences to our associates and customers we use advanced data science and machine learning capabilities to optimize our business and the customer experience our business is supported by digital and mobile technologies that provide enhanced customer experience while enabling highly integrated automation of all operating functions including credit processing and supply chain management buyers and sales consultants are equipped with mobile and centralized tools that allow them to access realtime information to better serve our customers our proprietary digital technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of our omnichannel operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers 

wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity realtime access to a complete view of our customer interactions from omnichannel allows our associates to provide a tailored and differentiated experience to our customers 

our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location leveraging our more than twentyfive years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles our system generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that account for factors including sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

marketing and advertising 

our marketing strategies are focused on driving customer growth through building awareness and affinity for the brand and acquiring inmarket shoppers and sellers these strategies are implemented through a broad range of media including but not limited to traditional broadcast digital search social outofhome sports sponsorships and newer influencer and activation programs our website and related mobile app received an average of 33 million monthly visits during fiscal 2022 and are a critical part of the customer’s journey allowing them to learn about carmax explore our full inventory in real time initiate vehicle transfers apply for financing preapproval receive an appraisal offer and even buy a car fully online our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2022 approximately 95 of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online 

in 2019 we introduced a new advertising campaign — the way it should be — highlighting the human element that carmax provides to the car buying and selling experiences during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we introduced the next phase of this national multimedia marketing campaign to increase awareness of our core omnichannel capabilities including our love your car guarantee campaign highlighting our 24hour test drives and 30day1500 mile moneyback guarantee aimed at elevating our customers’ confidence in their carmax vehicle purchase

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business sales results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

business risks 

we operate in a highly competitive industry failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation’s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of digital and online tools to market buy sell and finance used vehicles could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers and online and mobile sales platforms as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices new car dealers leverage their franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers to brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax 

retail competition some of our competitors have replicated or attempted to replicate portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car store in 1993 including our use of competitive nohaggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer’s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us 

competitors using online focused business models both for direct sales and consumertoconsumer facilitation could materially impact our business model increased online used vehicle offerings could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could 

have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations if we fail to respond effectively to our retail competitors it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

online facilitation in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines and online classified sites that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmaxcom to attract traffic these companies could also make it more difficult for carmax to otherwise market its vehicles online 

the increasing use of digital and online tools to facilitate consumers’ sales or tradeins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations for example online appraisal tools are available to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than carmax 

in addition there are companies that sell software and data solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to among other things more efficiently source and price inventory although these companies do not compete with carmax the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with carmax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of carmax’s internally developed proprietary systems 

if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures or to changes in the used vehicle marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

caf competition our caf segment is subject to competition from various financial institutions including banks and credit unions which provide vehicle financing to consumers if we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our thirdparty finance providers which are generally less profitable to carmax or through other outside financing sources moreover if caf competitors are able to attract potential customers before they visit carmax whether through competitive finance offers or ease of customer experience they may be directed to retail options other than carmax accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance offers to our customers or our finance competitors are able to successfully attract and redirect a disproportionate number of our potential customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

evolving marketplace the marketplace for used vehicles may be impacted by the significant and likely accelerating changes to the broader automotive industry the covid19 pandemic has likely accelerated the consumer trend of buying a car online sight unseen technological changes including the development of autonomous vehicles new products and services new business models and new methods of travel could reduce automotive retail demand or disrupt our current business model if we fail to respond effectively to the evolving marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions these conditions could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to national and regional us economic conditions these conditions include but are not limited to recession inflation interest rates unemployment levels the state of the housing market gasoline prices consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general these conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as a global health crisis like covid19 acts of terrorism or acts of war including the recent russian invasion of ukraine when these economic conditions worsen or stagnate it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally demand from particular consumer categories or demand for particular vehicle types it can also negatively impact availability of credit to finance vehicle purchases for all or certain categories of consumers this could result in lower sales decreased margins on units sold and decreased profits for our caf segment worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of latemodel used vehicles as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time this could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold 

any significant change or deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon capital to operate fund growth and support the activities of our caf segment changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support the expansion of our store base and sales growth in existing stores could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth although in recent years internally generated cash flows have generally been sufficient to maintain our operations and fund our growth there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate sufficient cash for these purposes failure to do so—or our decision to put our cash to other uses—would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our growth 

changes in the availability or cost of the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loans receivable through caf could adversely affect sales and results of operations we use a securitization program to fund the majority of the auto loans receivable originated by caf changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our revolving credit facility term loans senior unsecured notes and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions—especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows—could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

carmax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering competitive nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and could involve among other things our sales process our provision of financing our reconditioning process or our treatment of customers even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results 

the use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected we monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns provide accurate information and protect our reputation but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our failure to realize the benefits associated with our omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we have made a considerable investment in our omnichannel platform and a failure to capture the benefits that we expect from this rollout could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations in an evolving retail industry our business sales and results of operations may be negatively affected if we fail to provide a high quality and consistent customer experience regardless of sales channel if our omnichannel platform does not meet customer expectations or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the personnel at various levels who have the necessary skills and experience we need to implement our omnichannel initiatives 

our failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our growth is dependent on the success of our omnichannel platform as well as on opening stores in new and existing markets and continued sales growth in our existing stores the continued enhancement of our omnichannel model and the expansion of our store base place significant demands on our management team our associates and our information systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations sales growth in our existing stores requires that we continue to effectively execute our business strategies and implement new and ongoing initiatives to elevate the experience of our customers see the risk factor above titled “ our failure to realize the benefits associated with our omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations ” for more discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base and implementation of new initiatives also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion see the risk factor below titled “ our success depends upon the continued contributions of our associates ” for discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base also requires real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our associates 

our associates are the driving force behind our success we believe that one of the things that distinguishes carmax is a culture centered on valuing our associates a failure to maintain our culture in response to covid19 in response to some other crisis or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

in addition managing our response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic as well as our strategic initiatives require management employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities a failure to maintain an adaptable and responsive culture or to continue developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we have experienced and could continue to experience a shortage of associates for retail and operational positions which could have an impact on our ability to conduct our business and maintain qualified talent in key areas if we are unable to maintain positive relations or if despite our efforts we become subject to successful unionization efforts it could increase costs limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our ongoing success also depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles 

any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for example if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap in addition any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins 

we may experience greater credit losses in caf’s portfolio of auto loans receivable than anticipated 

we are exposed to the risk that our customers who finance their purchases through caf will be unable or unwilling to repay their loans according to their terms and that the vehicle collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to ensure full repayment credit losses are inherent in caf’s business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we make various assumptions and judgments about caf’s portfolio of auto loans receivable and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors although management will establish an allowance for loan losses it believes is appropriate this allowance may not be adequate for example when economic conditions deteriorate unexpectedly such as in connection with the initial covid19 outbreak additional loan losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses may occur in addition as the impact of covid19 continues our allowance for loan losses may prove insufficient losses in 

excess of the existing allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory and the parts used to recondition such inventory a failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory—or obstacles to acquiring inventory including parts—whether because of supply competition or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

used vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk accordingly if we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory including parts used to recondition inventory also could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we source a significant percentage of our vehicles through our appraisal process which includes our online instant appraisal offers and these vehicles are generally more profitable for carmax accordingly if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or fail to recognize those trends it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory it could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from thirdparty auctions which is generally less profitable for carmax our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition both from new and used car dealers directly and through third parties driving appraisal traffic to those dealers see the risk factor above titled “ we operate in a highly competitive industry ” for discussion of this risk our ability to source vehicles from thirdparty auctions could be affected by an increase in the number of closed auctions that are open only to new car dealers who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers 

our failure to realize the benefits associated with our strategic investments including actual or potential acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations and we may incur impairment losses on our strategic investments in equity securities 

from time to time carmax makes strategic investments including acquisitions and we currently hold noncontrolling equity investments in several companies we may encounter difficulties in managing our strategic investments and in assimilating new capabilities or acquisitions to meet the future needs of our business furthermore we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of these investments or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential benefits and risks of a particular investment 

additionally under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” if any investment’s fair value declines below its carrying value we will need to record an impairment loss in the applicable fiscal period as a result we may incur expenses related to the impairment of existing or future equity investments any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

the impacts of the covid19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and volatile the potential resurgence of infections or the emergence of new variants including more severe variants or variants for which vaccine efficacy is low could have an adverse impact on consumer demand our retail operations and our ability to secure financing to source inventory and to maintain adequate staffing among other adverse effects 

we rely on thirdparty finance providers to finance a significant portion of our customers’ vehicle purchases accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties 

we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and a number of thirdparty finance providers we also have arrangements with third parties who provide financing to some of our auction customers if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide financing to our customers provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers to supply epp products to our customers accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these thirdparties 

we receive revenue for selling epp products on behalf of unrelated thirdparties who are the primary obligors if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide epp products make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty vendors for key components of our business 

many components of our business including data management key operational processes and critical customer systems are provided by third parties we carefully select our thirdparty vendors but we do not control their actions if our vendors fail to perform as we expect our operations and reputation could suffer if the failure harms the vendors’ ability to serve us and our customers one or more of these thirdparty vendors may experience financial distress technology challenges staffing shortages or liquidity challenges file for bankruptcy protection go out of business or suffer disruptions in their business due to the covid19 outbreak the use of thirdparty vendors represents an unavoidable inherent risk to our company that could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers including manufacturer recalls 

adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles including the supply of latemodel used vehicles in addition manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence because we do not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs some vehicles we sell may have unrepaired safety recalls such recalls and our lack of authorization to make recallrelated repairs could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates as well as changes in accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of carmax’s assets liabilities revenues expenses and earnings if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 

the implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to gaap could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

protecting our intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights confidential information and trade secrets is integral to our business the failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is sensitive to weather events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain hail snow wind storms hurricanes extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

we are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated 

our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us california texas and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions or are particularly affected by covid19 and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus weather events or other regionspecific incidents it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations

our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to manage sales inventory our customerfacing websites and applications carmaxcom carmaxautofinancecom the carmax mobile app and carmaxauctionscom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary or the inability to enhance our information technology capabilities could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations

none 




 item 2 properties 

we conduct our retail vehicle operations primarily in two formats – production and nonproduction stores production stores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production stores have more service bays and require additional space for reconditioning activities and therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction store on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some stores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction stores until we expand our presence in that market we also have production and nonproduction stores that operate in metropolitan statistical areas “msas” of less than 600000 people which we define as small markets some of these stores also have a smaller footprint compared with our stores in larger markets

overview 

see part i item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company’s business 

  

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax our consolidated financial statements include the financial results related to our edmunds holding company “edmunds” business which does not meet the definition of a reportable segment for purposes of our mda discussion amounts related to that business are discussed in combination with our carmax sales operations segment separate discussion of these amounts is not considered meaningful for the purpose of gaining an understanding of our business as the significant drivers of these operations in total are consistent with those of our carmax sales operations segment where appropriate specific amounts related to nonreportable segments have been disclosed for informational purposes 

carmax sales operations 

our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services such as wholesale vehicle sales the sale of extended protection plan “epp” products which include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” and vehicle repair service we offer competitive nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles valueadded epp products and superior customer service our omnichannel platform which gives us the largest addressable market in the used car industry empowers our retail customers to buy a car on their terms – online instore or a seamless combination of both customers can choose to complete the carbuying experience inperson at one of our stores or buy the car online and receive delivery through express pickup available nationwide or home delivery available to most customers 

our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us and availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the sales process we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with industryleading thirdparty finance providers all of the finance offers whether by caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option 

as of february 28 2022 we operated 230 used car stores in 107 us television markets as of that date wholesale auctions previously held at many of our used car stores were being conducted virtually during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we sold our remaining new car franchise 

carmax auto finance 

in addition to thirdparty finance providers we provide vehicle financing through caf which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option as a result we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loans receivable less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 426 of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2022 as of february 28 2022 caf serviced approximately 11 million customer accounts in its 1565 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

management regularly analyzes caf’s operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer profitability the performance of the auto loans receivable including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses 

revenues and profitability 

the sources of revenue and gross profit from the carmax sales operations segment and other nonreportable segments for fiscal 2022 are as follows

refer to “results of operations” for further details on our revenues and profitability a discussion regarding results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is included in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 28 2021 filed with the sec on april 20 2021 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus “covid19”  as a global pandemic throughout fiscal 2021 many us states and localities had shelterinplace orders and occupancy restrictions impacting the operations of our stores and consumer demand as a result our fiscal 2021 results were significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic primarily during the first quarter 

although the effects of covid19 seem to have subsided uncertainty continues during fiscal 2022 states and localities conducted vaccine distribution programs and eased certain statemandated restrictions however the continued spread and impact of covid19 persists particularly as it relates to the emergence of new variants of the virus we continue to actively monitor developments that may cause us to take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates customers communities and shareholders 

liquidity 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from nonrecourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources in addition to funding our operations this liquidity was used to fund the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase program our store growth and the edmunds acquisition which was completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 

our current capital allocation strategy is to focus on our core business including investing in digital capabilities and the strategic expansion of our store footprint pursue new growth opportunities through investments partnerships and acquisitions and return excess capital to shareholders given the yearoveryear improvement in our business the strength of the credit markets and our solid balance sheet we believe we have the appropriate liquidity access to capital and financial strength to support our operations and continue investing in our strategic initiatives for the foreseeable future 

strategic update and future outlook 

since completing our omnichannel rollout in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we now have a common platform across all of carmax that leverages our scale nationwide footprint and infrastructure and empowers our customers to buy a vehicle on their terms we recognize that there has been an accelerated shift in consumer buying behavior customers are seeking personalization convenience and safety in how they shop for and buy a vehicle more than ever our omnichannel platform empowers customers to buy a car on their own terms whether completely from home instore or through a seamlessly integrated combination of online and instore experiences our diversified business model combined with our omnichannel experience is a unique advantage in the used car industry that firmly positions us to continue growing our market share while creating shareholder value over the longterm 

with the completion of our omnichannel platform rollout we are now focusing our efforts on optimizing and enhancing the customer experience in particular we are focused on completing the roll out of our selfservice experience currently approximately 90 of our customers are eligible to complete an online retail sale independently if they choose we expect to have this capability available to 100 of our customers by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 online retail sales accounted for 11 of retail unit sales up from 9 in the previous quarter and 5 in the prior year quarter omni sales represented approximately 55 of retail sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 down from 57 in the previous quarter and up from 51 in the prior year quarter the growing rate of customer adoption versus the prior year reinforces our belief in our omnichannel strategy 

revenue from online transactions was 24 billion or approximately 31 of net revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 up from 30 in the previous quarter and 17 in the prior year quarter 

we continue to see success from our online instant appraisal offer which quickly provides customers an offer on their vehicle this innovative experience allowed us to purchase approximately 162000 and 707000 vehicles online from consumers during the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2022 respectively representing approximately half of our total buys from consumers for both periods as a result our selfsufficiency has nearly doubled during the current year historically our annual selfsufficiency rate has been between 36 and 41 for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 our selfsufficiency rate was between 45 

and 50 and for the second through fourth quarters of fiscal 2022 we achieved record selfsufficiency rates above 70 the success of these offerings strengthens our leadership position as the largest used vehicle buyer from consumers in the us 

nearly twothirds of our finance customers start their financing process online with our financing offer product in our online checkout process eligible customers can apply and accept finance offers without needing the assistance of an associate to submit a credit application over the phone or in store in addition our finance based shopping capability available to most customers enables our customers to see personalized finance terms from multiple lenders across the full inventory of vehicles on our website during the month of march 2022 we further enhanced this experience and are testing additional capabilities including enabling realtime decisioning as well as the ability for a customer to prequalify for financing with no impact to their credit score 

our investments in the near term will focus on our customer experience vehicle acquisition and marketing our plans to grow vehicle acquisition include attracting new customers and pursuing partnerships as we expand our appraisal offerings to dealers and other businesses as we continue enhancing our online experience and offerings we believe it is important to educate customers about our omnichannel platform and to differentiate and elevate our brand during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we introduced the next phase of our national multimedia marketing campaign as a result marketing spend increased in the current year for fiscal 2023 we expect our marketing spend per unit to be at least as much as fiscal 2022 we believe we are well positioned to continue gaining market share through our marketing strategies which are focused on driving customer growth through building awareness and affinity for the brand and acquiring inmarket shoppers and sellers 

our strategic investments include the acquisition of edmunds which we completed on june 1 2021 the acquisition was the first in carmax history and added one of the most well established and trusted online guides for automotive information and a recognized industry leader in digital car shopping innovations to the carmax family with this acquisition carmax has enhanced its digital capabilities and further strengthened its role and reach across the used auto ecosystem while adding exceptional technology and creative talent edmunds continues to operate independently and remains focused on delivering confidence to consumers and excellent value to its dealer and oem clients additionally this acquisition allows both businesses to accelerate their respective capabilities to deliver an enhanced digital experience to our customers by leveraging edmunds’ compelling content and technology carmax’s unparalleled national scale and infrastructure and the combined talent of both businesses 

in order to execute our longterm strategy we plan to continue investing in various strategic initiatives to increase innovation specifically with regards to customerfacing and customerenabling technologies as well as marketing we are also focused on ensuring we are efficient in our spend targeting specific areas where we expect to achieve more efficiencies and leverage such as our cecs and stores our use of data is a core component of these initiatives and continues to be a strategic asset for us as we leverage data to enhance the customer experience and increase operational efficiencies 

during fiscal 2022 we saw meaningful improvements in the service levels of our cecs related to web and phone lead response time while also handling a record level of volume this improvement was due to a combination of staffing increases and ongoing utilization of our artificial intelligence and machine learning processes that drove the right work to the right associates from an efficiency perspective we continue to see gains in our buying organization the combination of our instant appraisal offer program along with the investments we have made in data science automation and artificial intelligence continue to reduce our costs per buy 

for fiscal 2023 we would expect to require an increase beyond the 5 to 8 range of gross profit growth to lever this is primarily driven by the timing of strategic investments and growthrelated costs as well as heightened inflationary pressures while we expect to remain in investment mode over the next few years we expect our leverage point to be lower after fiscal 2023 

we expect our diversified model the scale of our operations our investments and omnichannel strategy to provide a solid foundation for further growth in may 2021 we introduced 5year financial targets including i selling 2 million vehicles through our combined retail and wholesale channels by fiscal 2026 ii generating 33 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026 and iii growing our nationwide share of the age 010 used vehicle market to more than 5 by the end of calendar 2025 although we do not anticipate updating these targets annually given our strong performance in fiscal 2022 we believe it is appropriate to provide the following update at this time 

• sell between 2 million and 24 million vehicles through our combined retail and wholesale channels by fiscal 2026 

• generate between 33 billion and 45 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026 

• reaffirm the growth of our nationwide share of the age 010 used vehicle market to more than 5 by the end of calendar 2025 

these ranges reflect macroeconomic factors that could result in ongoing volatility in consumer demand 

in calendar 2021 we estimate we sold approximately 40 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold on a nationwide basis an increase from 35 in calendar 2020 we estimate we sold approximately 49 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate in calendar 2021 an increase from 43 in 2020 comparing our results to published used vehicle saar data suggests that we continued to grow our market share during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 despite the sales decline we experienced we believe we are well positioned to deliver profitable market share gains in any environment our strategy to increase our market share includes focusing on 

• delivering a customerdriven omnichannel buying and selling experience that is a unique and powerful integration of our instore and online capabilities 

• opening stores in new markets and expanding our presence in existing markets 

• hiring developing and retaining an engaged and skilled workforce 

• improving efficiency in our stores and cecs and our logistics operations to reduce waste 

• leveraging data and advanced analytics to continuously improve the customer experience as well as our processes and systems 

• utilizing advertising to educate customers about our omnichannel platform and to differentiate and elevate our brand 

as of february 28 2022 we had used car stores located in 107 us television markets which covered approximately 79 of the us population the format and operating models utilized in our stores are continuously evaluated and may change or evolve over time based upon market and consumer expectations during fiscal 2022 we opened ten stores and we anticipate opening ten stores during fiscal 2023 

while we execute both our short and longterm strategy there are trends and factors that could impact our strategic approach or our results in the short and medium term for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company see “risk factors” included in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting estimates 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 1 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses represents the net credit losses expected over the remaining contractual life of our managed receivables because net loss performance can vary substantially over time estimating net losses requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain 

the allowance for loan losses is determined using a net loss timing curve primarily based on the composition of the portfolio of managed receivables and historical gross loss and recovery trends due to the fact that losses for receivables with less than 18 months of performance history can be volatile our net loss estimate weights both historical losses by credit grade at origination and actual loss data on the receivables todate along with forward loss curves in estimating future performance once the receivables have 18 months of performance history the net loss estimate reflects actual loss experience of those receivables to date along with forward loss curves to predict future performance the forward loss curves are constructed using historical performance data and show the average timing of losses over the course of a receivable’s life the net loss estimate is calculated by applying the loss rates developed using the methods described above to the amortized cost basis of the managed receivables 

the output of the net loss timing curve is adjusted to take into account reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future specifically the change in us unemployment rates and the national automobile dealers association used vehicle price index are used to predict changes in gross loss and recovery rate respectively an economic adjustment factor based upon a single macroeconomic scenario is developed to capture the relationship between changes in these indices and changes in gross loss and recovery rates this factor is applied to the output of the net loss timing curve for the reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years after the end of this twoyear period we revert to historical experience on a straightline basis over a period of 12 months we periodically consider whether the use of alternative metrics would result in improved model 

performance and revise the model when appropriate we also consider whether qualitative adjustments are necessary for factors that are not reflected in the quantitative methods but impact the measurement of estimated credit losses such adjustments include the uncertainty of the impacts of recent economic trends on customer behavior the change in the allowance for loan losses is recognized through an adjustment to the provision for loan losses 

determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses requires management to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain including the timing and distribution of net losses that could materially affect the allowance for loan losses and therefore net earnings to the extent that actual performance differs from our estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce net earnings a 10 change in the estimated loss rates would have changed the allowance for loan losses by approximately 433 million as of february 28 2022 

see notes 1h and 5 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 the 555 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by a 229 increase in used unit sales and a 267 increase in average retail selling price the increase in used units included a 219 increase in comparable store used unit sales online retail sales as defined previously accounted for 9 of used unit sales in fiscal 2022 compared with 4 in fiscal 2021 

we believe our strong comparable store used unit sales growth in fiscal 2022 was driven by solid execution growing demand for our online offerings and strengthened marketing investments as well as the continued success of vehicle sourcing directly from consumers sales also benefited from the net impact of macroeconomic factors including federal government stimulus payments the chip shortage and its impact on new vehicle availability market prices and inflation our results for fiscal 2021 were significantly impacted by covid19 primarily during the first quarter 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 however we believe a number of macroeconomic factors impacted our comparable store used unit sales performance including declining consumer confidence the covid19 omicron variant vehicle affordability and the lapping of stimulus benefits paid in the prior year quarter 

the increase in average retail selling price in fiscal 2022 reflected higher vehicle acquisition costs driven by market appreciation 

wholesale vehicle sales 

vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are on average approximately 10 years old with more than 100000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards our wholesale auction prices usually reflect trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold during fiscal 2021 our wholesale auctions were moved to an online format in response to covid19 and continue to operate completely online 

fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 the 1534 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a 657 increase in used unit sales as well as a 551 increase in average selling price the wholesale unit growth in fiscal 2022 was largely driven by increased appraisal volume from online offerings as well as an increased buy rate which was over 40 in fiscal 2022 during fiscal 2022 our strong appraisal offers in response to the increase in market prices contributed to our higher appraisal buy rate the increase in average selling price was primarily due to increased acquisition costs driven by market appreciation 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of esps and gap collectively reported in epp revenues net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations net thirdparty finance incomefees advertising and subscription revenues earned by our edmunds business and other revenues which are predominantly comprised of service department and new vehicle sales the fees we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers the mix of our retail vehicles financed by caf tier 2 and tier 3 providers or customers that arrange their own financing may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants changes in providers’ credit decisioning and external market conditions changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers 

fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 other sales and revenues increased 232 in fiscal 2022 reflecting the addition of edmunds’ revenue of 1018 million as well as growth in epp revenues and net thirdparty finance income partially offset by a decline in new vehicle sales epp revenues increased 159 reflecting the increase in our retail unit volume partially offset by unfavorable yearoveryear changes in cancellation reserves net thirdparty finance income improved as a result of favorable adjustments in the fee arrangements with our tier 2 and tier 3 providers made during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as well as shifts in our sales mix by finance channel partially offset by increased sales the decline in new car sales was driven by the divestiture of our remaining new car franchises as noted above

3 calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue 

  

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit gross profit per used unit is consistent across our omnichannel platform 

we systematically adjust individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include the wholesale and retail vehicle pricing environments vehicle reconditioning and logistics costs and the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process vehicles purchased directly from consumers generally have a lower cost per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels which may generate more gross profit per unit we monitor macroeconomic factors and pricing elasticity and adjust our pricing accordingly to optimize unit sales and profitability while also maintaining a competitively priced inventory 

fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 used vehicle gross profit increased 283 in fiscal 2022 driven by the 229 increase in total used unit sales as well as the 92 increase in used vehicle gross profit per unit with used car prices at alltime highs during fiscal 2022 we chose to pass along some of our selfsufficiency driven acquisition cost savings to consumers by way of lower prices to make our vehicles more accessible while balancing inflationary costs and target margin increases 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit 

fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 806 in fiscal 2022 driven by the 657 increase in wholesale unit sales as well as a 90 increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues net thirdparty finance incomefees advertising and subscription profits earned by our edmunds business and other revenues other revenues are predominantly comprised of service department operations including used vehicle reconditioning and new vehicle sales we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net thirdparty finance incomefees as these represent revenues paid to us by certain thirdparty providers thirdparty finance income is reported net of the fees we pay to thirdparty tier 3 finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 other gross profit increased 321 in fiscal 2022 reflecting the addition of edmunds’ gross profit of 626 million as well as increases in epp revenues and net thirdparty finance income as discussed above partially offset by a decline in service department profits the decline in service department profits was primarily experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 reflecting deleverage resulting from lower retail unit sales as well as the adverse effects on technician staffing and reconditioning efficiency from the covid19 omicron variant additionally prior to the fourth quarter we experienced pressure from our efforts to support our higher level of retail sales including growing technician staffing and shifting retail service capacity to support vehicle reconditioning

fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 increase of 6208 million or 364  this increase reflected an increase in costs associated with our growth in sales volume growth costs related to the increase in appraisal buys new stores and customer support at our cecs and continued spending to advance our technology platforms and support strategic initiatives as well as costreduction actions taken in response to the pandemic in the prior year the increase also reflected the following 

• 3146 million increase in compensation and benefits expense excluding sharebased compensation expense driven by increased staffing sales growth a 262 million increase in our annual bonus compensation and a 245 million increase resulting from the addition of edmunds during the current year as well as costreduction actions taken in response to the pandemic in the prior year period 

• 1084 million increase in advertising expense driven by our previously communicated investment in advertising spend 

• 1823 million increase in other overhead costs primarily reflecting investments to advance our technology platforms and support our strategic initiatives as well as costreduction actions taken in response to the pandemic in the prior year period the current year included a 226 million onetime benefit related to the receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit while the prior year included a onetime benefit of 403 million related to the receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit 

interest expense 

interest expense includes the interest related to short and longterm debt financing obligations and finance lease obligations it does not include interest on the nonrecourse notes payable which is reflected within caf income 

fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 interest expense increased to 941 million in fiscal 2022 versus 862 million in fiscal 2021 the increase primarily reflected an increase in finance lease obligations and higher outstanding debt levels in fiscal 2022 

other income expense 

other income increased to 346 million in fiscal 2022 compared with 83 million in fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily due to net gains on an equity investment recorded during fiscal 2022

results of operations – carmax auto finance 

caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by caf’s portfolio of auto loans receivable less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses total interest margin reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time increases in interest rates which affect caf’s funding costs or other competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in compression in the interest margin on new originations changes in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables reflect the effect of changes in loss and delinquency experience and economic factors on our outlook for net losses expected to occur over the remaining contractual life of the loans receivable 

caf’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multiyear period historically we have sought to originate loans in our core portfolio which excludes tier 2 and tier 3 originations with an underlying risk profile that we believe will in the aggregate result in cumulative net losses in the 2 to 25 range excluding ceclrequired recovery costs over the life of the loans actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations economic conditions including the effects of covid19 and wholesale recovery rates current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business including the volume of loans originated current interest rates charged to consumers loan terms and average credit scores loans originated in a given fiscal period impact caf income over time as we recognize income over the life of the underlying auto loan 

caf also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers in order to better understand the performance of these loans mitigate risk and add incremental profits historically caf targeted originating approximately 5 of the total tier 3 loan volume during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we began to increase our tier 3 loan volume beyond our target of 5 of total tier 3 loan volume to 10 by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 additionally in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 caf began to originate loans in the tier 2 space on a test basis any future adjustments in tier 2 and tier 3 will consider the broader lending environment along with the longterm sustainability of the change these loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the caf portfolio as well as higher contract rates 

caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses

1 the allowance for loan losses as of february 28 2021 includes a 2020 million increase as a result of our adoption of cecl during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

2 the average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated generally at our wholesale auctions while in any individual period conditions may vary over the past 10 fiscal years the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 46 to a high of 71 and it is primarily affected by the wholesale market environment 

fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 

• caf income increased 2387 million or 424 reflecting increases in the total interest margin percentage and average managed receivables as well as a decrease in the provision for loan losses 

• provision for loan losses decreased to 1417 million from 1607 million 

◦ the change in the provision was primarily driven by reserve increases during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 associated with deterioration in the macroeconomic environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

◦ the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables was 277 as of february 28 2022 compared with 297 as of february 28 2021 

• total interest margin increased as a percentage of average managed receivables to 72 in fiscal 2022 compared with 61 in fiscal 2021 as a result of lower funding costs 

• loan performance 

◦ the increase in net loan originations in fiscal 2022 resulted from an increase in the average amount financed as well as our used unit sales growth 

◦ caf net penetration for fiscal 2022 was relatively consistent with the prior year however during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 caf net penetration declined slightly driven by an increase in the mix of customers utilizing outside financing in the current environment we seek to remain highly competitive in the marketplace while also maintaining the quality of caf’s portfolio 

◦ the increase in past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables for fiscal 2022 primarily reflected a return to prepandemic delinquency levels as well as an increase primarily in the 3160 day past due bucket resulting from the transition to caf’s new auto loan receivable servicing system during this transition we continue to adjust resources as needed from early stage collection efforts to handling the increased volume of incoming phone calls we are receiving as customers get accustomed to the new platform we ultimately expect this to normalize over time 

◦ the annual recovery rate for fiscal 2022 was at the top of our range due to market appreciation experienced during the year 

planned future activities 

  

we anticipate opening ten stores in fiscal 2023 which will include our expected entry into the new york metro market we currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately 500 million in fiscal 2023 an increase from 3085 million in fiscal 2022 the increase in planned capital spending in fiscal 2023 largely reflects longterm growth capacity initiatives for our auction sales and production facilities in addition to continued investments in technology we expect approximately 30 of our capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 will be focused on investments in technology

our contractual obligations related to income taxes represent the net unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions see note 11 for information related to income taxes our contractual obligations related to defined benefit retirement plans represent the funded status recognized as of february 28 2022 see note 12 for information related to these plans 

purchase obligations and commitments consist of certain enforceable and legally binding obligations related to real estate purchases thirdparty outsourcing services and advertising as of february 28 2022 our purchase obligations and commitments were approximately 2009 million of which 1080 million are due in fiscal 2023 the majority of the remaining purchase obligations and commitments are due within the next three years 

we currently target an adjusted debttototal capital ratio in a range of 35 to 45 at the end of fiscal 2022 our adjusted debt to capital ratio net of cash on hand was at the higher end of our targeted range for the year in calculating this ratio we utilize total debt excluding nonrecourse notes payable finance lease liabilities a multiple of eight times rent expense and total shareholders’ equity generally we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources together with stock repurchases to maintain this targeted ratio however in any period we may be outside this range due to seasonal market strategic or other factors 

operating activities  during fiscal 2022 net cash used in operating activities totaled 255 billion compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 6678 million in fiscal 2021 our operating cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in auto loans receivable which increased 194 billion in fiscal 2022 compared with 3008 million in fiscal 2021 

the majority of the changes in auto loans receivable are accompanied by changes in nonrecourse notes payable which are issued to fund auto loans originated by caf net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable were 170 billion in fiscal 2022 compared with 1515 million in fiscal 2021 and are separately reflected as cash from financing activities due to the presentation differences between auto loans receivable and nonrecourse notes payable on the consolidated statements of cash flows fluctuations in these amounts can have a significant impact on our operating and financing cash flows without affecting our overall liquidity working capital or cash flows 

  

as of february 28 2022 total inventory was 512 billion representing an increase of 197 billion or 623 compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average carrying cost of inventory as a result of higher acquisition costs driven by market appreciation as well as an increase in vehicle units saleable inventory levels have been below our targets throughout the current fiscal year as a result of temporary production slowdowns experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and strong demand experienced during fiscal 2022 we made substantial progress in building our inventory position during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and we achieved sequential growth in saleable inventory each month during the third quarter in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we continued to build inventory for tax refund season which typically has stronger demand as of february 28 2022 we believe our inventory is well positioned to support anticipated sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 

the change in net cash used in provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 reflected the changes in auto loans receivable and inventory as discussed above as well as accounts receivable driven by increased sales and timing partially offset by an increase in net earnings when excluding noncash expenses which include depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation expense and the provisions for loan losses and cancellation reserves our results for fiscal 2021 were significantly impacted by covid19 primarily during the first quarter in response we took proactive measures to strengthen our liquidity position including reducing our inventory levels and aligning our costs to lower sales volume 

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities totaled 5237 million in fiscal 2022 compared with 1282 million in fiscal 2021 for fiscal 2022 this included 2416 million in cash paid in connection with the edmunds acquisition net of cash acquired capital expenditures were 3085 million in fiscal 2022 versus 1645 million in fiscal 2021 capital expenditures primarily included store construction costs and store remodeling expenses as well as investments in technology we maintain a multiyear pipeline of sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years 

  

financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities was 310 billion in fiscal 2022 compared with net cash used in financing activities of 4240 million in fiscal 2021 included in these amounts were net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable of 170 billion compared with 1515 million respectively nonrecourse notes payable are typically used to fund changes in auto loans receivable see “operating activities” 

during fiscal 2022 cash provided by financing activities was impacted by stock repurchases of 5765 million as well as net borrowings on our longterm debt of 193 billion including a new 700 million term loan entered into during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 during fiscal 2021 cash used in financing activities was impacted by stock repurchases of 2299 million as well as net payments on our longterm debt of 4630 million

borrowings under our 200 billion unsecured revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us the credit facility term loans and senior note agreements contain representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements are not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity as of february 28 2022 we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

see note 13 for additional information on our revolving credit facility term loans senior notes and financing obligations 

caf auto loans receivable are primarily funded through our warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions these nonrecourse funding vehicles are structured to legally isolate the auto loans receivable and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our nonrecourse funding vehicles even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the related receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loans receivable we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these nonrecourse funding vehicles 

as of february 28 2022 1218 billion and 329 billion of nonrecourse notes payable were outstanding related to assetbacked term funding transactions and our warehouse facilities respectively during fiscal 2022 we funded a total of 732 billion in assetbacked term funding transactions as of february 28 2022 we had 176 billion of unused capacity in our warehouse facilities 

we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time as our store base sales and caf loan originations have grown see notes 1f and 13 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

we generally repurchase the receivables funded through our warehouse facilities when we enter into an assetbacked term funding transaction if our counterparties were to refuse to permit these repurchases it could impact our ability to execute on our funding program additionally the agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to fund 

receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the related receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

the timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on stock price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock as of february 28 2022 a total of 2 billion of board authorizations for repurchases was outstanding with no expiration date of which 7745 million remained available for repurchase in april 2022 our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization by 2 billion see note 14 for more information on share repurchase activity 

fair value measurements we recognize money market securities mutual fund investments certain equity investments and derivative instruments at fair value see note 7 for more information on fair value measurements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure  nonrecourse notes payable 

as of february 28 2022 and february 28 2021 all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved primarily through nonrecourse funding vehicles that in turn issued both fixed and variablerate notes nonrecourse funding vehicles include warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions 

borrowings under our warehouse facilities are variablerate debt and are secured by auto loans receivable the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through an assetbacked term funding transaction which issue notes payable that accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates 

interest rate risk related to variablerate debt is primarily mitigated by entering into derivative instruments our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loans receivable disruptions in the credit markets or unexpected changes in prepayment activity could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

absent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk a 100basis point increase in market interest rates associated with nonrecourse funding vehicles would have decreased our fiscal 2022 net earnings per share by approximately 014 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 6 and 7 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities

1 variablerate debt includes borrowings under our warehouse facilities as well as the variable portion of borrowings under our assetbacked term funding transactions see note 13 

  

interest rate exposure  other debt 

we have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our term loans however a portion of the variablerate risk is mitigated by derivative instruments substantially all of these borrowings are variablerate debt based on libor a 

100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2022 net earnings per share by approximately 004 

other market exposures 

our pension plan has interest rate risk related to its projected benefit obligation “pbo” due to the relatively young overall age of the plan’s participants a 100basis point change in the discount rate has approximately a 19 effect on the pbo balance a 100basis point decrease in the discount rate would have decreased our fiscal 2022 net earnings per share by less than 001 see note 12 for more information on our benefit plans 

  

as our cashsettled restricted stock units are liability awards the related compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the company’s stock price the marktomarket effect on the liability depends on each award’s grant price and previously recognized expense at february 28 2022 a 10 change in the company’s stock price would have affected fiscal 2022 net earnings per share by approximately 004

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background 

carmax inc delivers an unrivaled customer experience by offering a broad selection of quality used vehicles and related products and services at competitive nohaggle prices using a customerfriendly sales process we are the nation’s largest and most profitable retailer of used cars and we sold 751862 used vehicles at retail during the fiscal year ended february 28 2021 we are also one of the nation’s largest operators of wholesale vehicle auctions with 426268 vehicles sold during fiscal 2021 and one of the nation’s largest providers of used vehicle financing servicing approximately 1054000 customer accounts in our 1385 billion portfolio of managed receivables as of february 28 2021 

our omnichannel platform which gives us the largest addressable market in the used car industry empowers customers to buy a car on their terms – online instore or a seamless combination of both customers can choose to complete the carbuying experience inperson at one of our stores or buy the car online and receive delivery through contactless curbside pickup available nationwide or home delivery available to most customers 

carmax was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax store in richmond virginia on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company as of february 28 2021 we operated 220 used car stores in 106 us television markets our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

impact of covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 as a global pandemic throughout fiscal 2021 many us states and localities have shelterinplace orders and occupancy restrictions impacting the operations of our stores and consumer demand we have implemented robust plans to reduce the risk of exposure and transmission of the virus in our stores and continue to follow the mandates of public health officials and government agencies we also launched contactless curbside pickup nationwide to better serve our customers in alignment with enhanced safety practices in addition we quickly shifted our wholesale business from inperson to online auctions and kept our appraisal lanes open for customers who wanted or needed to sell their cars during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we completed the rollout of our omnichannel platform giving us the largest addressable market in the used car industry despite the challenges associated with the covid19 pandemic this omnichannel platform is allowing customers to connect and transact with us in more ways than ever 

the ongoing crisis of covid19 continues to evolve at the end of fiscal 2021 states and localities were in the midst of a vaccine distribution program however the ultimate duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic remain uncertain we continue to actively monitor developments that may cause us to take further actions that alter our business operations for further discussion of the impacts of covid19 on our business and fiscal 2021 results refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

carmax business 

we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations our carmax sales operations segment sells used vehicles purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources sells related products and services and arranges financing options for customers all for competitive nohaggle prices we enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer 

purchasing a vehicle  

the vehicle purchase process at carmax differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience our nohaggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for other consumer products our omnichannel platform further empowers our customers to buy a car on their own terms – online instore or a seamless combination of both customers can choose to complete the carbuying experience inperson at one of our stores or buy the car online and receive delivery through contactless curbside pickup available nationwide or home delivery available to most customers 

our omnichannel platform provides multiple ways for our customers to interact with us including completely online a customer may interact with our customer experience consultants when communicating with us via phone or text messages these employees are paid a fixed hourly rate and receive incentive bonuses based on their ability to effectively progress the customer through their car buying journey customers may also interact inperson with our sales consultants who are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate these pay structures align our associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

we recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our carmax quality certified standards and each vehicle must pass an inspection before being offered for sale we stand behind every used vehicle we sell with our love your car guarantee this guarantee gives customers the ability to take 24hour test drives before committing to purchase as well as provides a 30day1500 mile moneyback guarantee and a 90day4000mile limited warranty our carmax quality certified standards were developed internally by carmax and are not affiliated with any third party or original equipment manufacturer program 

we maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory available for viewing on carmaxcom as well as our mobile apps as of february 28 2021 we had approximately 63000 saleable retail vehicles in our inventory vehicles intransit or on customer hold are not visible on our website upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our inventory this gives carmax customers access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer in fiscal 2021 approximately 38 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request 

in addition to retailing used vehicles we sold new vehicles under franchise agreements at two locations during fiscal 2021 during the fourth quarter we sold the toyota new car franchise located in laurel md resulting in one new car franchise remaining at february 28 2021 

selling us a vehicle  

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a customer’s vehicle free of charge and make a written guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us this nohaggle offer is good for seven days in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we completed the nationwide rollout of our online instant appraisal offer which quickly gives customers an offer on their vehicle early response to this offering has been strong positioning us to become the largest online buyer of used vehicles from consumers and strengthening our leadership position as the largest used vehicle buyer from consumers 

based on age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through our appraisal process meet our retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers in response to the covid19 pandemic we moved our auctions previously held at 74 of our 220 stores to an online platform during fiscal 2021 as of february 28 2021 our average auction sales rate was approximately 95 

financing a vehicle  

the availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process and having an array of finance sources increases approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax our finance program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both caf and thirdparty providers we believe that our processes and systems transparency of pricing and vehicle quality as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit allow caf and our thirdparty providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment all 

finance offers whether from caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge 

related products and services  

we provide customers with a range of other related products and services including extended protection plan “epp” products and vehicle repair service epp products include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” which is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business in fiscal 2021 approximately 60 of the customers who purchased a retail used vehicle also purchased an esp and approximately 20 purchased gap 

carmax auto finance caf provides financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history and other credit data of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely to carmax customers our scoring models are optimized for the carmax channel we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 425 of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2021 

caf also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements collecting payments maintaining contact with delinquent customers and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans 

competition 

carmax sales operations the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and we face competition from franchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles online sellers independent used car dealers and private parties according to industry sources as of december 31 2020 there were over 18000 franchised dealers in the us who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles competition in our industry has evolved with the adoption of online platforms and marketing tools all of which facilitate increased competition 

based on industry data there were approximately 38 million used cars sold in the us in calendar 2020 of which approximately 21 million were estimated to be age 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us in calendar 2020 we estimate we sold approximately 35 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold on a nationwide basis we estimate we sold approximately 43 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate in calendar 2020 a decline from 47 in 2019 we had strong momentum entering the current year and were gaining significant market share up until the onset of the covid19 pandemic during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as markets reopened and our omnichannel platform launched nationwide we began gaining market share again leading to market share gains over the last five months of calendar 2020 our market share is generally correlated to the length of time we have operated in a given market entering new markets could have a dampening effect on our market share given that our initial market share in new markets is generally much lower than our average 

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our competitive nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems the transparency and availability of caf and thirdparty financing the locations of our retail stores and our commitment to evolving our carbuying experience to meet customers’ changing expectations we believe our omnichannel platform reinforces our competitive advantages as it empowers customers to buy a car on their own terms whether completely from home instore or through a seamlessly integrated combination of online and instore experiences our diversified business model combined with our emerging omnichannel experience is a unique advantage in the used car industry that firmly positions us to continue growing our market share while creating shareholder value over the longterm we completed our omnichannel rollout in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we now have a common platform across all of carmax that leverages our scale nationwide footprint and infrastructure and empowers our customers to buy a vehicle on their terms 

in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our high volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards 

our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast to the highly fragmented used vehicle retail market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc which together represent a large majority of the north american wholesale car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax’s auctions predominantly sell older higher mileage vehicles during fiscal 2021 in response to the impacts of covid19 we quickly transitioned our wholesale auctions to an online platform once we restart inperson auction operations we expect to continue to use online wholesale technology by moving to simulcast auctions 

carmax auto finance caf operates and is a significant participant in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies according to industry sources this sector represented more than 1 trillion in outstanding receivables as of december 31 2020 caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars 

we believe that caf’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source for carmax customers and that caf’s primary driver for growth is the growth in carmax’s retail used unit sales we periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness we also monitor 3day payoffs as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our offer 

products and services 

retail merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including domestic imported and luxury vehicles at competitive prices our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old these vehicles generally range in price from 11000 to 37000 the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences seasonality and market pricing and availability 

wholesale auctions the typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase our auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis 

extended protection plans in conjunction with the sale of a vehicle we offer customers epp products we receive revenue for selling these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors we have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements the esps we currently offer on all used retail vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract the epps that we sell other than manufacturer programs on new car sales have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements periodically we may receive profitsharing revenues based upon the performance of the esp policies administered by third parties as of february 28 2021 our thirdparty esp providers included assurant inc cna national warranty corporation and fidelity warranty services inc our thirdparty gap provider as of february 28 2021 was safeguard products international llc 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our internal standards before it can become a carmax quality certified vehicle this process includes an inspection of the engine and all major systems based on this inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our internal quality standards many of our stores depend upon nearby typically larger carmax stores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services including but not limited to services related to manufacturer’s warranties we engage third parties specializing in those services carmax does not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs and some vehicles carmax sells may have unrepaired safety recalls however safety recall information as reported by the national highway traffic safety administration is available on our website and we review any unrepaired safety recall information with our used vehicle customers before purchase 

all carmax used car stores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by the esps we sell additionally we have partnered with thirdparty providers of auto service and repair through these partnerships our customers have access to a nationwide network of trusted quality and fairpriced service and repair locations 

customer credit we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and arrangements with several financial institutions vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the 

vehicle as of february 28 2021 our thirdparty finance providers included ally financial american credit acceptance capital one auto finance chase auto finance exeter finance corp santander consumer usa and westlake financial services we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged and held by thirdparty providers and we periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

generally credit applications submitted by customers to carmax are initially reviewed by caf using our proprietary underwriting standards based on that review caf makes financing offers designed to create a loan portfolio that meets our targeted risk profile in the aggregate applications that caf declines or approves with conditions are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers thirdparty providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we refer to the providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as tier 3 providers we are willing to pay a fee to tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that they may not otherwise be able to obtain all fees either received or paid are prenegotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount financed the interest rate the term of the loan or the loantovalue ratio caf also provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a tier 3 provider 

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

suppliers for used vehicles 

we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our instore and online appraisal processes as well as through local regional and online auctions while in any individual period conditions may vary over the past 5 fiscal years 36 to 41 of our retail inventory has been acquired through our appraisal process annually we also acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market 

the supply of latemodel used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the volume of new vehicle sales which in turn generate used car tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry sources there were approximately 281 million light vehicles in operation in the us as of december 31 2020 during calendar year 2020 it is estimated that approximately 14 million new cars and 38 million used cars were sold at retail many of which were accompanied by tradeins and more than 15 million wholesale vehicles were sold at auctions and through other channels 

based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year consumer acceptance of our appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

seasonality 

historically our business has been seasonal our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer with an increase in traffic and sales in february and march coinciding with federal income tax refunds sales are typically slowest in the fall in fiscal 2021 traffic and sales were impacted by the covid19 pandemic during periods of the year when we have historically experienced strong traffic and sales and it remains unclear how the continuing impact of covid19 and related stimulus payments will affect the seasonality of our business 

technology 

we leverage a combination of cloudbased solutions and proprietary technologies to run our operations we have a strong software engineering discipline and we have adopted agile devops lean and other leading digital delivery practices technology teams are tightly integrated with the rest of the business and part of the crossfunctional “product” teams our product teams use a “test and learn” approach to iterate and deploy new technologyenabled experiences to our associates and customers carmax uses advanced data science and machine learning capabilities to optimize our business and the customer experience our business is supported by digital and mobile technologies that provide enhanced customer experience while enabling highly integrated automation of all operating functions including credit processing and supply chain management buyers and sales consultants are equipped with mobile and centralized tools that allow them to access realtime information to better serve our customers our proprietary digital technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of our omnichannel operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers 

wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity realtime access to a complete view of our customer interactions from omnichannel allows our associates to provide a tailored and differentiated experience to our customers 

our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location leveraging our more than twentyfive years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles our system generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that take into account factors that include sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

marketing and advertising 

our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmaxcom and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle these strategies are implemented through a broad range of media types including but not limited to traditional broadcast digital search video on demand and social our website and related mobile apps received an average of 27 million monthly visits during fiscal 2021 and are marketing tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail they are also sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct part of the shopping and sales process online our website and mobile apps also include a variety of other customer service features including the ability to initiate vehicle transfers schedule appointments and apply for financing preapproval information on the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated near realtime our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2021 approximately 96 of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online 

in 2019 we introduced a new advertising campaign — the way it should be — highlighting the human element that carmax provides to the car buying and selling experiences during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we introduced the next phase of this national multimedia marketing campaign to increase awareness of our core omnichannel capabilities including our love your car guarantee campaign highlighting our 24hour test drives and 30day1500 mile moneyback guarantee aimed at elevating our customers’ confidence in their carmax vehicle purchase

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business sales results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

business risks 

the covid19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic has led to a severe disruption in general economic activity particularly retail operations as businesses and federal state and local governments take measures to mitigate the ongoing public health crisis we have experienced significant disruption to our business both in terms of disruption to our operations and the adverse effect on overall economic conditions while we have reopened the stores that we closed at the beginning of the outbreak we continue to maintain restricted operations at many of our retail and wholesale locations and we may need to close stores again in the future the scope and duration of these limitations are uncertain and the continued potential for store closures may persist limited retail operations including occupancy restrictions and store closures and the uncertainty caused by covid19 resulted in weakened consumer demand these conditions could continue to have a significantly negative effect on all aspects of our business including used vehicle sales operations wholesale vehicle auctions used vehicle financing extended protection plan sales inventory acquisition and retail service 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic further impacts our industry business sales results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to 

the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact including the availability and efficacy of vaccines and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the long term effect covid19 may have on our business or the economy and even if the covid19 pandemic subsides we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its economic impact and changes in consumer behavior 

we operate in a highly competitive industry failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation’s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of digital and online tools to market buy sell and finance used vehicles could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers and online and mobile sales platforms as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices new car dealers leverage their franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers to brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax 

retail competition some of our competitors have replicated or attempted to replicate portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car store in 1993 including our use of competitive nohaggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer’s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us 

competitors using online focused business models both for direct sales and consumertoconsumer facilitation could materially impact our business model increased online used vehicle offerings could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations if we fail to respond effectively to our retail competitors it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

online facilitation in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines and online classified sites that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmaxcom to attract traffic these companies could also make it more difficult for carmax to otherwise market its vehicles online 

the increasing use of digital and online tools to facilitate consumers’ sales or tradeins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations for example online appraisal tools are available to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than carmax 

in addition there are companies that sell software and data solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to among other things more efficiently source and price inventory although these companies do not compete with carmax the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with carmax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of carmax’s internally developed proprietary systems 

if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures or to changes in the used vehicle marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

caf competition our caf segment is subject to competition from various financial institutions including banks and credit unions which provide vehicle financing to consumers if we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our thirdparty finance providers which are generally less profitable to carmax or through other outside financing sources moreover if caf competitors are able to attract potential customers before they visit carmax whether through competitive finance offers or ease of customer experience they may be directed to retail options other than carmax accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance offers to our customers or our finance competitors are able to successfully attract and redirect a disproportionate number of our potential customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

evolving marketplace the marketplace for used vehicles may be impacted by the significant and likely accelerating changes to the broader automotive industry the covid19 pandemic has likely accelerated the consumer trend of buying a car online sight unseen technological changes including the development of autonomous vehicles new products and services new business models and new methods of travel could reduce automotive retail demand or disrupt our current business model if we 

fail to respond effectively to the evolving marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions these conditions could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to national and regional us economic conditions these conditions include but are not limited to recession inflation interest rates unemployment levels the state of the housing market gasoline prices consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general these conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as a global health crisis like covid19 and acts of terrorism when these economic conditions worsen or stagnate it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally demand from particular consumer categories or demand for particular vehicle types it can also negatively impact availability of credit to finance vehicle purchases for all or certain categories of consumers this could result in lower sales decreased margins on units sold and decreased profits for our caf segment worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of latemodel used vehicles as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time this could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold 

any significant change or deterioration in economic conditions including as a result of covid19 could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon capital to operate fund growth and support the activities of our caf segment changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support the expansion of our store base and sales growth in existing stores could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth although in recent years internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to maintain our operations and fund our growth there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate sufficient cash for these purposes failure to do so—or our decision to put our cash to other uses—would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our growth 

changes in the availability or cost of the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loans receivable through caf could adversely affect sales and results of operations we use a securitization program to fund the majority of the auto loans receivable originated by caf changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our revolving credit facility term loan senior unsecured notes and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions—especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows—could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

carmax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering competitive nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and could involve among other things our 

sales process our provision of financing our reconditioning process or our treatment of customers even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results 

the use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected we monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns provide accurate information and protect our reputation but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our failure to realize the benefits associated with our omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we completed the rollout of our omnichannel platform we have made a considerable investment in our omnichannel platform and a failure to capture the benefits that we expect from this rollout could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations in an evolving retail industry our business sales and results of operations may be negatively affected if we fail to provide a high quality and consistent customer experience regardless of sales channel if our omnichannel platform does not meet customer expectations or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the personnel at various levels who have the necessary skills and experience we need to implement our omnichannel initiatives 

our failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our growth is dependent on the success of our omnichannel platform as well as on opening stores in new and existing markets and continued sales growth in our existing stores the continued enhancement of our omnichannel model and the expansion of our store base place significant demands on our management team our associates and our information systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations sales growth in our existing stores requires that we continue to effectively execute our business strategies and implement new and ongoing initiatives to elevate the experience of our customers see the risk factor above titled “ our failure to realize the benefits associated with our omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations ” for more discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base and implementation of new initiatives also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion see the risk factor above titled “ our success depends upon the continued contributions of our associates ” for discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base also requires real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our associates 

our associates are the driving force behind our success we believe that one of the things that distinguishes carmax is a culture centered on valuing our associates a failure to maintain our culture in response to covid19 or in response to some other crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

in addition managing our response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic as well as our strategic initiatives require management employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities a failure to maintain an adaptable and responsive culture or to continue developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the spread of covid19 especially in the early half of fiscal 2021 caused us to modify our business practices including adopting measures such as hiring freezes employee furloughs and reduction in pay for certain officers we have subsequently lifted these measures but as the pandemic continues or potentially worsens we may have to adopt similar measures in the future that may affect our ability to maintain positive associate relations if we are unable to maintain positive relations or if despite our efforts we become subject to successful unionization efforts it could increase costs limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our response to covid19 and our ongoing success also depend upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles 

any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for example if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap in addition any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins 

we may experience greater credit losses in caf’s portfolio of auto loans receivable than anticipated 

we are exposed to the risk that our customers who finance their purchases through caf will be unable or unwilling to repay their loans according to their terms and that the vehicle collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to ensure full repayment credit losses are inherent in caf’s business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we make various assumptions and judgments about caf’s portfolio of auto loans receivable and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors although management will establish an allowance for loan losses it believes is appropriate this allowance may not be adequate for example when economic conditions deteriorate unexpectedly such as in connection with the initial covid19 outbreak additional loan losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses may occur in addition as the impact of covid19 continues our allowance for loan losses may prove insufficient losses in excess of the existing allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory a failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory—or obstacles to acquiring inventory—whether because of supply competition or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

used vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk accordingly if we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory also could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we source a significant percentage of our vehicles through our appraisal process which includes our online instant appraisal offers and these vehicles are generally more profitable for carmax accordingly if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or fail to recognize those trends it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory it could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from thirdparty auctions which is generally less profitable for carmax our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition both from new and used car dealers directly and through third parties driving appraisal traffic to those dealers see the risk factor above titled “ we operate in a highly competitive industry ” for discussion of this risk our ability to source vehicles from thirdparty auctions could be affected by an increase in the number of closed auctions that are open only to new car dealers who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers 

our failure to realize the benefits associated with our strategic investments including potential acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations and we may incur impairment losses on our strategic investments in equity securities 

from time to time carmax makes strategic investments including acquisitions and we currently hold noncontrolling equity investments in several companies we may encounter difficulties in managing our strategic investments and in assimilating new capabilities or acquisitions to meet the future needs of our business furthermore we may not realize all the anticipated benefits of these investments or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential benefits and risks of a particular investment 

additionally under us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” if any investment’s fair value declines below its carrying value we will need to record an impairment loss in the applicable fiscal period as a result we may incur expenses 

related to the impairment of existing or future equity investments any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty finance providers to finance a significant portion of our customers’ vehicle purchases accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties 

we provide financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty finance providers if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide financing to our customers provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers to supply epp products to our customers accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these thirdparties 

we receive revenue for selling epp products on behalf of unrelated thirdparties who are the primary obligors if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide epp products make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty vendors for key components of our business 

many components of our business including data management key operational processes and critical customer systems are provided by third parties we carefully select our thirdparty vendors but we do not control their actions if our vendors fail to perform as we expect our operations and reputation could suffer if the failure harms the vendors’ ability to serve us and our customers one or more of these thirdparty vendors may experience financial distress staffing shortages or liquidity challenges file for bankruptcy protection go out of business or suffer disruptions in their business due to the covid19 outbreak the use of thirdparty vendors represents an unavoidable inherent risk to our company that could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers including manufacturer recalls 

adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles including the supply of latemodel used vehicles in addition manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence because we do not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs some vehicles we sell may have unrepaired safety recalls such recalls and our lack of authorization to make recallrelated repairs could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates as well as changes in accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of carmax’s assets liabilities revenues expenses and earnings if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 

the implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to gaap could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

protecting our intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights confidential information and trade secrets is integral to our business the failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is sensitive to weather events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain hail snow wind storms hurricanes extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

we are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated 

our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us california texas and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions or are particularly affected by covid19 and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

we conduct our retail vehicle operations primarily in two formats – production and nonproduction stores production stores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production stores have more service bays and require additional space for reconditioning activities and therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction store on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some stores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction stores until we expand our presence in that market we also have production and nonproduction stores that operate in metropolitan statistical 

areas “msas” of less than 600000 people which we define as small markets some of these stores also have a smaller footprint compared with our stores in larger markets

overview 

see part i item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company’s business 

  

carmax is the nation’s largest and most profitable retailer of used vehicles we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations 

our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services such as wholesale vehicle sales the sale of extended protection plan “epp” products which include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” and vehicle repair service we offer competitive nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles valueadded epp products and superior customer service our omnichannel platform which gives us the largest addressable market in the used car industry empowers customers to buy a car on their terms – online instore or a seamless combination of both customers can choose to complete the carbuying experience inperson at one of our stores or buy the car online and receive delivery through contactless curbside pickup available nationwide or home delivery available to most customers 

our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us and availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the sales process we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with industryleading thirdparty finance providers all of the finance offers whether by caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option 

as of february 28 2021 we operated 220 used car stores in 106 us television markets as of that date wholesale auctions previously held at 74 of our used car stores were being conducted virtually during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we sold the toyota new car franchise located in laurel md resulting in 1 new car franchise remaining at february 28 2021 

carmax auto finance 

in addition to thirdparty finance providers we provide vehicle financing through caf which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option as a result we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loans receivable less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 425 of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2021 as of february 28 2021 caf serviced approximately 1054000 customer accounts in its 1385 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

management regularly analyzes caf’s operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer profitability the performance of the auto loans receivable including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses

refer to “results of operations” for further details on our revenues and profitability a discussion regarding results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 is included in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 29 2020 filed with the sec on april 21 2020 

impact of covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus “covid19” as a global pandemic in the following weeks many us states and localities issued shelterinplace orders impacting the operations of our stores and consumer demand we followed mandates from public health officials and government agencies including implementation of enhanced cleaning measures and social distancing guidelines and in many localities the closing of stores and wholesale auctions as a result of these store closures and lower consumer demand we announced in april 2020 that more than 15000 associates had been placed on furlough we provided associates with at least 14 days of pay continuity upon store 

closure or quarantine along with continuing medical benefits for associates who were furloughed during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we began to call back associates from furlough and by the end of july 2020 we no longer had any associates on furlough during the first half of fiscal 2021 we spent approximately 30 million supporting associates impacted by covid19 store closures and furloughs 

we have implemented robust plans to reduce the risk of exposure and transmission of the virus in our stores and continue to follow the mandates of public health officials and government agencies we also launched contactless curbside pickup nationwide to better serve our customers in alignment with enhanced safety practices in addition we quickly shifted our wholesale business from inperson to online auctions during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we completed the rollout of our omnichannel platform giving us the largest addressable market in the used car industry this offering allows customers to seamlessly do as much or as little online and inperson as they prefer 

our fiscal 2021 results were significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic in particular retail sales were negatively impacted by store closures and occupancy restrictions in response to covid19 primarily during the first quarter for further details of these impacts refer to “results of operations” 

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as the pandemic escalated our caf business saw an increase in delinquencies and greater demand for payment extensions in response we implemented a variety of measures to support our customers through this difficult time and to maximize the longterm collectability of the portfolio this included temporarily suspending repossessions waiving late fees and providing loan payment extensions where appropriate in addition to pausing our inhouse tier 3 lending we also made temporary underwriting adjustments focused on preserving cafs highquality portfolio and tested certain loan routing to our thirdparty providers 

payment extensions spiked in april and have declined significantly since then as customers have exhibited the ability and willingness to pay during fiscal 2021 delinquency rates were lower yearoveryear during the back half of the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we ceased cafs underwriting adjustments noted above and in september we resumed our inhouse tier 3 lending 

during fiscal 2021 new legislation was enacted to provide relief to businesses in response to the covid19 pandemic including the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “cares act” and the taxpayer certainty and disaster tax relief act on march 6 2021 the american rescue plan act of 2021 was enacted we have evaluated the tax provisions of these acts as well as new irs guidance issued while the most significant impacts to the company include the employee retention tax credit and payroll tax deferral provisions of the cares act we do not expect recent irs guidance or the legislation to have a material impact on our results of operations 

the ongoing crisis of covid19 continues to evolve and cause uncertainty at the end of fiscal 2021 states and localities were in the midst of a vaccine distribution program however the continued spread and impact of covid19 persist as such we are unable to determine the full impact that social distancing protocols the availability and efficacy of vaccines or potential subsequent outbreaks will ultimately have on our operations or consumer demand we continue to actively monitor developments that may cause us to take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our associates customers and shareholders 

liquidity 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from nonrecourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources in addition to funding our operations this liquidity was used to fund the repurchase of common stock under our share repurchase program and our store growth 

as previously disclosed in response to the covid19 pandemic we took certain measures in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to enhance our liquidity position and provide additional financial flexibility including drawing down additional funds on our revolving credit facility pausing our stock repurchase program pausing our store expansion strategy and remodels and actively aligning operating expenses to the current state of the business including the previously discussed furlough we strengthened our overall financial position by selling through inventory and quickly aligning costs to lower sales volumes we have continued to adjust inventory levels and operating expenses throughout the pandemic to align with sales trends during the third quarter we fully paid down the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and resumed our store expansion strategy and share repurchase program given the turnaround in our business the strength of the credit markets and our solid balance sheet we believe we have the appropriate liquidity access to capital and financial strength to support our operations and continue investing in our omni and digital initiatives as well as other strategic initiatives for the foreseeable future 

strategic update and future outlook 

the covid19 pandemic has created an unprecedented and challenging time as discussed above we have taken several steps to ensure a strong liquidity position and enable our stores to operate amidst the current health and safety concerns while continuing to invest in our strategic priorities we will continue to monitor the ongoing effects of the pandemic and make any further decisions necessary to position the company for a strong recovery as we emerge from this crisis 

we recognize the current environment has accelerated a shift in consumer buying behavior customers are seeking safety personalization and convenience in how they shop for and buy a vehicle more than ever our omnichannel platform empowers customers to buy a car on their own terms whether completely from home instore or through a seamlessly integrated combination of online and instore experiences our diversified business model combined with our emerging omnichannel experience is a unique advantage in the used car industry that firmly positions us to continue growing our market share while creating shareholder value over the longterm we completed our omnichannel rollout in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we now have a common platform across all of carmax that leverages our scale nationwide footprint and infrastructure and empowers our customers to buy a vehicle on their terms 

with the completion of our omnichannel rollout we are now focusing our efforts on optimizing and enhancing the customer experience in particular we are focused on enabling selfservice for all components of the sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we made significant progress in this area and at the end of the quarter approximately 25 of our customers were eligible to buy a vehicle online independently if they choose up significantly from the third quarter we are on track for most of our customers to have the ability to buy a vehicle online independently if they choose by the middle of fiscal 2022 additionally approximately 75 of our customers advanced their transaction digitally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 with approximately 5 buying the vehicle online 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we completed the nationwide rollout of our online instant appraisal offer which quickly provides customers an offer on their vehicle early response to this offering has been strong positioning us to become the largest online buyer of used vehicles from consumers and strengthening our leadership position as the largest used vehicle buyer from consumers we believe that our online appraisal offers provide us with the potential to approach or exceed the high end of our historical selfsufficiency rate we also introduced our love your car guarantee in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 this guarantee allows customers to take a 24hour test drive before committing to purchase and also offers a 30day1500 mile moneyback guarantee and a 90day4000mile limited warranty at the end of the fourth quarter we also launched a “penny perfect” transactable financing offer in our online checkout process with this enhancement customers can apply and accept finance offers without needing the assistance of an associate to submit a credit application over the phone or in store we plan to make this available to all customers in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 

we first launched our omnichannel platform in the atlanta market in december 2018 now two years later after continued testing on pricing and advertising our omnichannel platform is delivering sustained growth in this competitive market the atlanta market continues to outperform the company maintaining its market share in calendar 2020 despite pressure from covid19 during the last five months of calendar 2020 our market share in atlanta increased 138 over the past two years our market share in atlanta has increased 109 

our strategic investments in the near term will focus on our customer experience vehicle acquisition and marketing as we continue enhancing our online experience and offerings we believe it is important to educate customers on our omnichannel platform and to differentiate and elevate our brand during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we introduced the next phase of our national multimedia marketing campaign that began last year as a result marketing spend increased yearoveryear throughout the quarter we set records every week for web visits reaching more than 8 million weekly visits by the end of february 2021 after the campaign launch web traffic and google query volumes were both up approximately 25 compared with the months prior to launch as we head into fiscal 2022 we expect our marketing spend to remain elevated with similar per unit expenses as experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021 we believe we are well positioned to gain market share through the promotion of our omnichannel platform and new product offerings such as our love your car guarantee 

leveraging the enhanced omnichannel platform advertising campaign and experience in our atlanta market discussed above we implemented pricing and marketing tests in select markets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 in an effort to proactively drive sales volume early results for these tests were positive and we plan to continue these tests into the first quarter of fiscal 2022 while also monitoring macroeconomic factors we expect our gross profit per used unit to remain above 2000 for the quarter while these tests confirm what we have historically seen regarding price elasticity several factors have changed resulting in a stronger flow through from the increased sales and thereby driving profitability these factors include the high level of profitability for our caf originations a lower variable cost structure resulting from our continued transition to cecs and the favorable changes to our thirdparty finance providers fee structure 

in march 2021 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire edmunds one of the most well established and trusted online guides for automotive information and a recognized industry leader in digital car shopping innovations with this acquisition carmax will enhance its digital capabilities and further strengthen its role and reach across the used auto ecosystem while adding exceptional technology and creative talent edmunds will continue to operate independently and will remain focused on delivering confidence to consumers and excellent value to its dealer and oem clients additionally this acquisition will allow both businesses to accelerate their respective capabilities to deliver an enhanced digital experience to their customers by leveraging edmunds’ compelling content and technology our unparalleled national scale and infrastructure and the combined talent of both businesses we expect to pay for the transaction with a combination of cash and equity the transaction is subject to certain conditions to close typical for a transaction of this nature we anticipate this transaction will close in june 2021 and expect edmunds’ financial results to have an immaterial impact to carmax’s earnings per share in fiscal 2022 with potential for significant shareholder value creation over the longer term 

our longterm strategy continues to be focused on completing the rollout of our retail concept and improving and enhancing our omnichannel experience with the goal of increasing our share of used vehicle unit sales in each of the markets in which we operate at the same time we are identifying and investing in new initiatives that we believe will contribute to earnings growth we believe over the long term used vehicle unit sales are the primary driver for earnings growth we also believe increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and over time increased caf income 

in order to execute our longterm strategy we plan to continue to invest in various strategic initiatives to increase innovation specifically with regards to customerfacing and customerenabling technologies as well as marketing we are also focused on ensuring we are efficient in our spend targeting specific areas where we expect to achieve more efficiencies and leverage this includes our cecs which are maturing and becoming more efficient and effective this past year our cecs were more efficient than the prior year and we expect this trend to accelerate in fiscal 2022 our use of data is a core component of these initiatives and continues to be a strategic asset for us as we leverage data to enhance the customer experience and increase operational efficiencies for fiscal 2022 we would expect to leverage our sga expenses when comparable store used unit sales growth is in the range of 5 to 8 on a twoyear stacked basis in periods of investment like fiscal 2022 we will need to be at the higher end of this twoyear range to lever against fiscal 2021 

in calendar 2020 we estimate we sold approximately 43 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate a decline from 47 in 2019 we had strong momentum entering the current year and were gaining significant market share up until the onset of the covid19 pandemic during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as markets reopened and our omnichannel platform launched nationwide we began gaining market share again leading to market share gains over the last five months of calendar 2020 on a nationwide basis we estimate we sold approximately 35 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold our strategy to increase our market share includes focusing on 

• delivering a customerdriven omnichannel buying and selling experience that is a unique and powerful integration of our instore and online capabilities 

• opening stores in new markets and expanding our presence in existing markets 

• hiring and developing an engaged and skilled workforce 

• improving efficiency in our stores and our logistics operations to reduce waste 

• leveraging data and advanced analytics to continuously improve the customer experience as well as our processes and systems 

as of february 28 2021 we had used car stores located in 106 television markets which covered approximately 77 of the us population the format and operating models utilized in our stores are continuously evaluated and may evolve over time based upon market and consumer expectations we opened 4 stores in fiscal 2021 in response to covid19 we paused our store expansion strategy in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we have resumed new store growth and anticipate opening ten stores during fiscal 2022 

while we execute both our short and longterm strategy there are trends and factors that could impact our strategic approach or our results in the short and medium term for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company see “risk factors” included in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to 

make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 1 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving funding program composed of three warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loans receivable originated by caf we typically elect to fund these receivables through an assetbacked term funding transaction such as a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement at a later date we recognize transfers of auto loans receivable into the warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions including term securitizations together “nonrecourse funding vehicles” as secured borrowings which result in recording the auto loans receivable and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loans receivable less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses 

see notes 1f 1h and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loans receivable 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses represents the net credit losses expected over the remaining contractual life of our managed receivables because net loss performance can vary substantially over time estimating net losses requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain 

the allowance for loan losses is determined using a net loss timing curve primarily based on the composition of the portfolio of managed receivables and historical gross loss and recovery trends due to the fact that losses for receivables with less than 18 months of performance history can be volatile our net loss estimate weights both historical losses by credit grade at origination and actual loss data on the receivables todate along with forward loss curves in estimating future performance once the receivables have 18 months of performance history the net loss estimate reflects actual loss experience of those receivables to date along with forward loss curves to predict future performance the forward loss curves are constructed using historical performance data and show the average timing of losses over the course of a receivable’s life the net loss estimate is calculated by applying the loss rates developed using the methods described above to the amortized cost basis of the managed receivables 

the output of the net loss timing curve is adjusted to take into account reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future specifically the change in us unemployment rates and the national automobile dealers association  “nada”  used vehicle price index are used to predict changes in gross loss and recovery rate respectively an economic adjustment factor based upon a single macroeconomic scenario is developed to capture the relationship between changes in these indices and changes in gross loss and recovery rates this factor is applied to the output of the net loss timing curve for the reasonable and supportable forecast period of two years after the end of this two year period the impact of the economic factor is phased out of the allowance for loan loss calculation on a straightline basis over a period of 12 months we periodically consider whether the use of alternative metrics would result in improved model performance and revise the model when appropriate we also consider whether qualitative adjustments are necessary for factors not reflected in the quantitative methods but impact the measurement of estimated credit losses such adjustments include the uncertainty of the impacts of recent economic trends on customer behavior the change in the allowance for loan losses is recognized through an adjustment to the provision for loan losses 

determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses requires management to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain including the timing and distribution of net losses that could materially affect the allowance for loan losses and therefore net earnings to the extent that actual performance differs from our estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce net earnings a 10 change in the estimated loss rates would have changed the allowance for loan losses by approximately 411 million as of february 28 2021 

see notes 1h and 4 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 30‑day moneyback 

guarantee we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors to customers who purchase a retail vehicle the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their retail installment contract we recognize revenue on a net basis at the time of sale we also record a reserve or refund liability for estimated contract cancellations the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience recent trends and credit mix of the customer base our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of epp sales customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates a 10 change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately 125 million as of february 28 2021 see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves 

we are contractually entitled to receive profitsharing revenues based on the performance of the esps administered by third parties these revenues are a form of variable consideration included in epp revenues to the extent that it is probable that it will not result in a significant revenue reversal an estimate of the amount to which we expect to be entitled subject to various constraints is recognized upon satisfying the performance obligation of selling the esp these constraints include factors that are outside of the company’s influence or control and the length of time until settlement we apply the expected value method utilizing historical claims and cancellation data from carmax customers as well as external data and other qualitative assumptions this estimate is reassessed each reporting period with changes reflected in other sales and revenues on our consolidated statements of earnings and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 

customers applying for financing who are not approved or are conditionally approved by caf are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we recognize these fees at the time of sale 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 the 85 decrease in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to a 97 decrease in used unit sales partially offset by a 13 increase in average retail selling price the decrease in used units included an 117 decrease in comparable store used unit sales this reflected the combined effects of covid19 related store closures and restrictions in operations as well as reduced customer traffic resulting from the economic impact of the pandemic and nationwide shelterinplace orders the increase in average retail selling price reflected higher vehicle acquisition costs driven by market appreciation partially offset by shifts in the mix of our sales by vehicle age 

we experienced negative comparable used unit sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which continued into june when we experienced high single digit negative comparable used unit sales the june results were more than offset by midsingle digit positive comparable used unit sales in both july and august a trend that continued into september however as the election approached and covid19 cases surged which resulted in tightened occupancy restrictions and shelterinplace orders from state and local governments we saw demand soften as a result sales trended down in the latter part of the third quarter sales began to accelerate towards the end of december and into january as we launched our new marketing campaign expanded our pricing tests introduced new customer offerings and a second round of stimulus checks was issued this trend continued until the middle of february when severe winter weather across a large portion of the us delays in tax refunds relative to last year’s timing and a lower inventory position due to covid19 and weatherrelated production constraints negatively impacted retail sales comparable used unit sales growth for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were also impacted by the extra day for leap day in the prior year 

sales in march 2021 were robust exceeding 100000 used units sold for the month and resulting in doubledigit used unit and comparable used unit sales growth when compared with a covid19 impacted march 2020 and a record march 2019 during the month the initial distribution of tax refund and stimulus checks began weather improved and customers continued to respond favorably to our ongoing strategic investments and growth initiatives 

wholesale vehicle sales 

vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are on average approximately 10 years old with more than 100000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold our wholesale auctions were moved to an online format in response to the covid19 pandemic and continue to operate completely online 

fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 the 67 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to a 171 increase in average selling price partially offset by an 86 decrease in wholesale unit sales the increase in average selling price was primarily due to increased acquisition costs driven by market appreciation the decline in wholesale units was largely driven by lower appraisal traffic which was significantly impacted by covid19 partially offset by an increase in our appraisal buy rate we achieved a record buy rate in fiscal 2021 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of esps and gap collectively reported in epp revenues net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are predominantly comprised of service department and new vehicle sales the fees we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers the mix of our retail vehicles financed by caf tier 2 and tier 3 providers or customers that arrange their own financing may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants changes in providers’ credit decisioning and external market conditions changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers 

fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 other sales and revenues declined 127 in fiscal 2021 reflecting decreases in other revenues including new car and service department sales and epp revenues partially offset by the improvement in net thirdparty finance fees epp revenues declined 56 largely reflecting the reduction in our used unit sales as discussed above partially offset by favorable adjustments to the cancellation reserves and an increase in profit sharing revenue recognized in the current year the new car and service department sales declines reflected both store closures and reduced customer traffic in response to covid19 the decline in new car sales was also driven by the divestiture of a franchise in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 net thirdparty finance fees improved as a result of favorable adjustments in the fee agreements with our tier 2 and tier 3 providers made during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit 

we systematically adjust individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include the wholesale and retail vehicle pricing environments vehicle reconditioning and logistics costs and the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels 

fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 used vehicle gross profit declined 127 in fiscal 2021 reflecting the 97 decline in total used unit sales as well as the 73 decline in used vehicle gross profit per unit during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 our used vehicle gross profit per unit was pressured by pricing adjustments made to better align inventory levels with sales in response to covid19 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 our used vehicle gross profit per unit was impacted by pricing tests rolled out in select markets 

we believe we can manage to a targeted gross profit per unit dollar range subject to future changes to our business pricing strategy or external market conditions as noted above in connection with the improvements and enhancements we are making to our omnichannel experience we also implemented pricing and marketing tests in select markets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 early results for these tests were positive and we plan to continue the tests into the first quarter of fiscal 2022 while also monitoring macroeconomic factors we continue to expect gross profit per used unit to be above 2000 during the quarter 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit 

fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 wholesale vehicle gross profit decreased 68 in fiscal 2021 driven by the 86 decrease in wholesale unit sales partially offset by a modest increase in wholesale gross profit per unit wholesale gross profit per unit 

was under significant pressure early in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 reflecting sharp declines in industry wholesale valuations however wholesale gross profit per unit had fully recovered by the end of the first quarter during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 performance was supported by strong appreciation in the market by the end of the second quarter depreciation had returned to the wholesale market and steep depreciation continued during the third quarter at the beginning of the fourth quarter industry prices flattened out and began to appreciate through the remainder of the quarter 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues other revenues are predominantly comprised of service department operations including used vehicle reconditioning and new vehicle sales we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent revenues paid to us by certain thirdparty providers thirdparty finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to thirdparty tier 3 finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 other gross profit decreased 181 in fiscal 2021 reflecting a decline in service department profits and epp revenues service results reflected the overhead deleverage resulting from our decline in used car sales pay continuity for our technicians and other service personnel during periods of reduced vehicle reconditioning activity in the first quarter and discretionary bonuses for service and reconditioning associates

3 calculated as total sga expenses divided by total used vehicle units 

fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 decrease of 413 million or 21  this decrease reflected a reduction in costs associated with our decline in sales volume and actions taken in response to covid19 to reduce costs partially offset by continued spending to advance our technology platforms and support strategic initiatives the decrease also reflected the following 

• 403 million onetime benefit representing our receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit related to the economic loss associated with vehicles containing takata airbags 

• 262 million increase in advertising expense primarily due to our new advertising campaign launched during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and incremental marketing spend in select markets in conjunction with our expanded pricing tests 

• 123 million increase in sharebased compensation expense the increase in sharebased compensation expense was largely related to cashsettled restricted stock units as the expense associated with these units was primarily driven by the change in the companys stock price during the relevant periods 

interest expense 

interest expense includes the interest related to short and longterm debt financing obligations and finance lease obligations it does not include interest on the nonrecourse notes payable which is reflected within caf income 

fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 interest expense of 862 million in fiscal 2021 was relatively consistent with 830 million in fiscal 2020 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 226 in fiscal 2021 compared with 235 in fiscal 2020 the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in excess tax benefits recognized on stock exercises and releases in fiscal 2021 

results of operations – carmax auto finance 

caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by caf’s portfolio of auto loans receivable less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses total interest margin reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time increases in interest rates which affect caf’s funding costs or other competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in compression in the interest margin on new originations changes in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables reflect the effect of changes in loss and delinquency experience and economic factors on our outlook for net losses expected to occur over the remaining contractual life of the loans receivable 

caf’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multiyear period historically we have strived to originate loans with an underlying risk profile that we believe will in the aggregate and excluding caf’s tier 3 originations result in cumulative net losses in the 2 to 25 range over the life of the loans actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations economic conditions including the effects of the covid19 outbreak and wholesale recovery rates based on underwriting adjustments made during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to higher anticipated losses related to covid19 we targeted new loans toward the higher end of this range in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we ceased the underwriting adjustments made during the previous quarter and we anticipate loans originated since to remain within our targeted range current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business including the volume of loans originated current interest rates charged to consumers loan terms and average credit scores loans originated in a given fiscal period impact caf income over time as we recognize income over the life of the underlying auto loan 

caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses

2 the average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated generally at our wholesale auctions while in any individual period conditions may vary over the past 10 fiscal years the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 46 to a high of 60 and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment 

fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 

• caf income increase of 1068 million or 234 

◦ the increase in caf income reflects increases in the total interest margin percentage and average managed receivables as well as a decrease in the provision for loan losses 

◦ the decrease in net loan originations in fiscal 2021 largely resulted from our used vehicle sales decline 

• provision for loan losses decreased to 1607 million from 1857 million 

◦ the provision largely reflected our initial estimate of lifetime losses on loans originated in fiscal 2021 

◦ the provision also included an increase in our estimate of lifetime losses made during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 largely resulting from covid19 turmoil and worsened economic factors which was largely offset by favorable loss experience in comparison to our expectations during the remainder of fiscal 2021 

◦ the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables was 297 as of february 28 2021 compared with 264 as of march 1 2020 after our adoption of cecl 

◦ we believe our current reserve is appropriate and considers both the positive customer payment behavior recently observed as well as the unpredictability of the current environment and the uncertain consumer situation 

• total interest margin increased as a percentage of average managed receivables to 61 in fiscal 2021 compared with 57 in fiscal 2020 as a result of lower funding costs 

tier 3 loan originations caf also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers in order to better understand the performance of these loans mitigate risk and add incremental profits historically caf has targeted originating approximately 5 of the total tier 3 loan volume however this rate may vary over time based on market conditions during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we paused our caf tier 3 lending given the current economic outlook and uncertainty surrounding covid19 early in the third quarter we resumed our tier 3 lending program a total of 1477 million and 1675 million in caf tier 3 receivables were outstanding as of february 28 2021 and february 29 2020 respectively these loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the caf portfolio as well as higher contract rates as of february 28 2021 and february 29 2020 approximately 10 of the total allowance for loan losses related to the outstanding caf tier 3 loan balances subsequent to the end of fiscal 2021 we began to increase our tier 3 volume beyond our target of 5 of the total tier 3 loan volume and we anticipate reaching and maintaining a 10 share in tier 3 loan volume by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 

planned future activities 

  

we anticipate opening ten stores in fiscal 2022 these stores will predominantly be cross functional stores that have a smaller footprint and can leverage our scale and presence of the larger format stores in nearby markets we currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately 350 million in fiscal 2022 over 100 million or approximately onethird of this spend will be focused on investments in technology an increase from approximately 15 four years ago

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations store expansion and improvement caf and strategic growth initiatives since fiscal 2013 we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from nonrecourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to covid19 we took immediate and proactive measures to bolster our liquidity position and provide additional financial flexibility to improve our ability to meet our shortterm liquidity needs those measures included drawing down additional funds on our revolving credit facility pausing our stock repurchase program pausing our store expansion strategy and actively aligning operating expenses to the current state of the business we strengthened our overall financial position by selling through inventory and quickly aligning costs to lower sales volumes we have continued to adjust inventory levels throughout the pandemic to align with sales trends during the third quarter we fully paid down the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and resumed our store expansion strategy and share 

repurchase program given the turnaround in our business the strength of the credit markets and our solid balance sheet we believe we have the appropriate liquidity access to capital and financial strength to support our operations and continue investing in our strategic initiatives for the foreseeable future 

in march 2021 we signed a definitive agreement to acquire edmunds for a purchase price that implies an enterprise value of 404 million inclusive of our initial investment we expect to pay for the transaction with a combination of cash and equity and anticipate it will close in june 2021 

we are party to contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties these obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs our contractual obligations primarily consist of longterm debt and related interest payments leases purchase obligations and commitments income taxes and defined benefit retirement plans see notes 11 and 15 for amounts outstanding as of february 28 2021 related to debt and leases respectively 

our contractual obligations related to income taxes represent the net unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions see note 9 for information related to income taxes our contractual obligations related to defined benefit retirement plans represent the funded status recognized as of february 28 2021 see note 10 for information related to these plans 

purchase obligations and commitments consist of certain enforceable and legally binding obligations related to real estate purchases thirdparty outsourcing services and advertising as of february 28 2021 our purchase obligations and commitments were approximately 1412 million of which 680 million are due in fiscal 2022 the majority of the remaining purchase obligations and commitments are due within the next three years 

we currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35 to 45 at the end of fiscal 2021 our adjusted debt to capital ratio was below our targeted range for the year in calculating this ratio we utilize total debt excluding nonrecourse notes payable finance lease liabilities a multiple of eight times rent expense and total shareholders’ equity generally we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources together with stock repurchases to maintain this targeted ratio however in any period we may be outside this range due to seasonal market strategic or other factors 

operating activities  during fiscal 2021 net cash provided by operating activities totaled 6678 million compared with net cash used in operating activities of 2366 million in fiscal 2020 our operating cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in auto loans receivable which increased 3008 million in fiscal 2021 compared with 131 billion in fiscal 2020 

the majority of the changes in auto loans receivable are accompanied by changes in nonrecourse notes payable which are issued to fund auto loans originated by caf net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable were 1515 million in fiscal 2021 compared with 108 billion in fiscal 2020 and are separately reflected as cash from financing activities due to the presentation differences between auto loans receivable and nonrecourse notes payable on the consolidated statements of cash flows fluctuations in these amounts can have a significant impact on our operating and financing cash flows without affecting our overall liquidity working capital or cash flows 

  

as of february 28 2021 total inventory was 316 billion representing an increase of 3107 million or 109 compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year the increase primarily reflected an increase in the average carrying cost of inventory as a result of higher acquisition costs driven by market appreciation as well as increased units due to decreased sales at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of severe weather and tax refund delays 

the change in net cash provided by used in operating activities for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 reflected the change in auto loans receivable partially offset by a decrease in net earnings when excluding noncash expenses which include depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation expense and the provisions for loan losses and cancellation reserves 

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities totaled 1282 million in fiscal 2021 and 3894 million in fiscal 2020 investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled 1645 million in fiscal 2021 and 3319 million in fiscal 2020 capital expenditures primarily include store construction costs real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store remodeling expenses we maintain a multiyear pipeline of sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years in response to covid19 we paused our store expansion and remodel strategy during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we have since resumed these activities we opened 4 stores in fiscal 2021 compared with 13 stores in fiscal 2020 

  

financing activities  net cash used in financing activities was 4240 million in fiscal 2021 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of 6870 million in fiscal 2020 included in these amounts were net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable of 1515 million compared with 108 billion respectively nonrecourse notes payable are typically used to fund changes in auto loans receivable see operating activities 

during fiscal 2021 cash used in financing activities was impacted by stock repurchases of 2299 million as well as net payments on our longterm debt of 4630 million during fiscal 2020 cash provided by financing activities was impacted by stock repurchases of 5677 million as well as net borrowings on our longterm debt of 778 million

3 total debt excludes unamortized debt issuance costs see note 11 for additional information 

borrowings under our 145 billion unsecured revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us the credit facility term loan and senior note agreements contain representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements are not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity as of february 28 2021 we were in compliance with these financial covenants 

see note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility term loan senior notes and financing obligations 

caf auto loans receivable are primarily funded through our warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions these nonrecourse funding vehicles are structured to legally isolate the auto loans receivable and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our nonrecourse funding vehicles even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the related receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loans receivable we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these nonrecourse funding vehicles 

as of february 28 2021 1145 billion and 231 billion of nonrecourse notes payable were outstanding related to assetbacked term funding transactions and our warehouse facilities respectively during fiscal 2021 we funded a total of 578 billion in assetbacked term funding transactions as of february 28 2021 we had 161 billion of unused capacity in our warehouse facilities 

we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time as our store base sales and caf loan originations have grown see notes 1f and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

we generally repurchase the receivables funded through our warehouse facilities when we enter into an assetbacked term funding transaction if our counterparties were to refuse to permit these repurchases it could impact our ability to execute on our funding program additionally the agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to fund receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest 

and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the related receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

the timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on stock price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock as of february 28 2021 a total of 2 billion of board authorizations for repurchases were outstanding with no expiration date of which 134 billion remained available for repurchase in march 2020 our current stock repurchase program was suspended the repurchase authorization remained effective and the program resumed in september 2020 see note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure  nonrecourse notes payable 

as of february 28 2021 and february 29 2020 all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved primarily through nonrecourse funding vehicles that in turn issued both fixed and variablerate notes nonrecourse funding vehicles include warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions 

borrowings under our warehouse facilities are variablerate debt and are secured by auto loans receivable the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through an assetbacked term funding transaction which issue notes payable that accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates 

interest rate risk related to variablerate debt is primarily mitigated by entering into derivative instruments our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loans receivable disruptions in the credit markets or unexpected changes in prepayment activity could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

absent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk a 100basis point increase in market interest rates associated with nonrecourse funding vehicles would have decreased our fiscal 2021 net earnings per share by approximately 011 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities

interest rate exposure  other debt 

we have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our term loan however a portion of the variablerate risk is mitigated by a derivative instrument substantially all of these borrowings are variablerate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2021 net earnings per share by approximately 002 

other market exposures 

our pension plan has interest rate risk related to its projected benefit obligation “pbo” due to the relatively young overall age of the plan’s participants a 100basis point change in the discount rate has approximately a 20 effect on the pbo balance a 100basis point decrease in the discount rate would have decreased our fiscal 2021 net earnings per share by less than 001 see note 10 for more information on our benefit plans 

  

as our cashsettled restricted stock units are liability awards the related compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the company’s stock price the marktomarket effect on the liability depends on each award’s grant price and previously recognized expense at february 28 2021 a 10 change in the company’s stock price would have affected fiscal 2021 net earnings per share by approximately 004

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background 

carmax inc delivers an unrivaled customer experience by offering a broad selection of quality used vehicles and related products and services at competitive nohaggle prices we are the nation’s largest retailer of used cars and we sold 832640 used vehicles at retail during the fiscal year ended february 29 2020  we are also one of the nation’s largest operators of wholesale vehicle auctions with 466177 vehicles sold during fiscal 2020 and one of the nation’s largest providers of used vehicle financing servicing approximately 1036000 customer accounts in our 1362 billion portfolio of managed receivables as of february 29 2020  

by the end of fiscal 2020 more than 60 of customers had access to our omnichannel experience which provides them the option to buy or sell a car on their terms—from home instore or in a seamless combination of online and instore experiences our omnichannel experience provides multiple options for customers to interact with us throughout their car buying journey including our mobile apps carmaxcom over the phone or online with a centralized customer experience consultant or inperson at one of our attractive modern sales facilities through these new capabilities a customer can also have a car or test drive delivered right to their home or enjoy express or curbside pick up of their vehicle at the store closest to them 

carmax was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax store in richmond virginia on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company as of february 29 2020  we operated 216 used car stores in 106 us television markets our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

impact of covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 as a global pandemic and in the following weeks many us states and localities issued lockdown orders impacting the operations of our stores and consumer demand since then the covid19 situation within the us has rapidly escalated and approximately half of our stores have been closed or have run under limited operations based upon the fluidity of the current environment we expect that stores will continue to reopen or close in accordance with government mandates or public health concerns consumer demand has deteriorated and sales have dropped significantly most of our stores that remain open are selling 50 or less of what they sold last year a trend that continued into april 2020 in april 2020 we announced approximately 15500 associates have been placed on furlough effective april 18 2020 the majority of furloughed associates are employed at stores that are currently closed due to government mandates we have taken other measures subsequent to the end of our fiscal year to enhance our liquidity position and provide additional financial flexibility including drawing down additional funds on our revolving credit facility halting our stock repurchase program pausing our store expansion strategy and remodels and actively aligning operating expenses to the current state of the business we continue to monitor the situation closely and it is possible that we will implement further measures 

we had intended to complete our omnichannel rollout in fiscal 2021 but in light of the evolving covid19 outbreak we have pivoted to focus on rolling out the most pertinent parts of the experience such as online selfprogression and curbside or express pick up as quickly and broadly as possible in our remaining markets given current customer needs 

carmax business 

we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations our carmax sales operations segment sells used vehicles purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources sells related products and services and arranges financing options for customers all for fixed nohaggle prices we enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer 

purchasing a vehicle  

the vehicle purchase process at carmax differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience our nohaggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they 

shop for other consumer products our new omnichannel experience further empowers our customers to buy a car on their own terms either completely from home instore or in a combination of online and instore experiences 

our new omnichannel experience provides multiple ways for our customers to interact with us a customer may interact with our customer experience consultants when communicating with us via phone or text messages these employees are paid a fixed hourly rate and receive incentive bonuses based on their ability to effectively progress the customer through their car buying journey customers may also interact inperson with our sales consultants who are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate these pay structures align our associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

we recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our carmax quality certified standards and each vehicle must pass an inspection before being offered for sale we stand behind every used vehicle we sell with a 7day moneyback guarantee and a 90day4000mile limited warranty our carmax quality certified standards were developed internally by carmax and are not affiliated with any third party or original equipment manufacturer program 

we maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory of approximately 80000 retail vehicles as of february 29 2020  available for viewing on carmaxcom as well as our mobile apps upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our inventory this gives carmax customers access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer in fiscal 2020  approximately 34 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request 

in addition to retailing used vehicles we sell new vehicles at two locations under franchise agreements 

selling us a vehicle  

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a customer’s vehicle free of charge and make a written guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us this nohaggle offer is good for seven days 

based on age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through our appraisal process meet our retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers as of february 29 2020  we conducted wholesale auctions at 74 of our 216 stores with an average auction sales rate of approximately 95  

financing a vehicle  

the availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process and having an array of finance sources increases approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax our finance program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both caf and thirdparty providers we believe that our processes and systems transparency of pricing and vehicle quality as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit allow caf and our thirdparty providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment all finance offers whether from caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge 

related products and services  

we provide customers with a range of other related products and services including extended protection plan “epp” products and vehicle repair service epp products include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” which is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business in fiscal 2020  approximately 61 of the customers who purchased a retail used vehicle also purchased an esp and approximately 19 purchased gap 

carmax auto finance caf provides financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history and other credit data of the 

customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely to carmax customers our scoring models are optimized for the carmax channel we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 425 of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2020  

caf also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements collecting payments maintaining contact with delinquent customers and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans 

competition 

carmax sales operations the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and we face competition from franchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles online sellers independent used car dealers and private parties according to industry sources as of december 31 2019  there were approximately 18000 franchised dealers in the us who we consider to be our primary retail competitors as they sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles competition in our industry has evolved with the adoption of online platforms and marketing tools all of which facilitate increased competition 

based on industry data there were approximately 41 million used cars sold in the us in calendar 2019  of which approximately 23 million were estimated to be age 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us in calendar 2019  we estimate we sold approximately 47 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate a 42 increase in these markets from approximately 44 in calendar 2018 our market share is generally the highest in markets in which we have been established for many years entering new markets could have a dampening effect on our market share given that our initial market share in new markets is generally much lower than our average on a nationwide basis we estimate we sold approximately 35 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in calendar year 2019  

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our competitive nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on site and via carmaxcom and our mobile apps the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems the transparency and availability of caf and thirdparty financing the locations of our retail stores and our commitment to evolving our carbuying experience to meet customers’ changing expectations we believe our omnichannel experience reinforces our competitive advantages and we are currently pivoting to focus on rolling out the most pertinent parts of the experience as quickly and broadly as possible given current customer needs in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our high volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards 

our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast to the highly fragmented used vehicle retail market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc which together represent an estimated 70 of the north american wholesale car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax’s auctions predominantly sell older higher mileage vehicles in response to the impacts of covid19 subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020 we have been able to quickly move our wholesale auctions to an online platform we believe our ability to move our auctions online when necessary provides us an additional competitive advantage 

carmax auto finance caf operates and is a significant participant in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies according to industry sources this sector represented more than 1 trillion in outstanding receivables as of december 31 2019  caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars 

we believe that caf’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source for carmax customers and that caf’s primary driver for growth is the growth in carmax’s retail used unit sales we periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness we also monitor 3day payoffs as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our offer 

products and services 

retail merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including domestic imported and luxury vehicles at competitive prices our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old these vehicles generally range in price from 11000 to 36000 the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences seasonality and market pricing and availability 

wholesale auctions the typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase our auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis 

  

extended protection plans in conjunction with the sale of a vehicle we offer customers epp products we receive revenue for selling these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors we have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements the esps we currently offer on all used retail vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract the epps that we sell other than manufacturer programs on new car sales have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements periodically we may receive profitsharing revenues based upon the performance of the esp policies administered by third parties as of february 29 2020  our thirdparty esp providers included assurant inc cna national warranty corporation and fidelity warranty services inc our thirdparty gap provider as of february 29 2020 was safeguard products international llc 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our internal standards before it can become a carmax quality certified vehicle this process includes an inspection of the engine and all major systems based on this inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our internal quality standards many of our stores depend upon nearby typically larger carmax stores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services including but not limited to services related to manufacturer’s warranties we engage third parties specializing in those services carmax does not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs and some vehicles carmax sells may have unrepaired safety recalls however safety recall information as reported by the national highway traffic safety administration is available on our website and we review any unrepaired safety recall information with our used vehicle customers before purchase 

all carmax used car stores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by the esps we sell additionally we have partnered with thirdparty providers of auto service and repair through these partnerships we can provide our customers with access to a nationwide network of trusted quality and fairpriced service and repair locations 

customer credit we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and arrangements with several financial institutions vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicle as of february 29 2020  our thirdparty finance providers included ally financial american credit acceptance capital one auto finance chase auto finance exeter finance corp santander consumer usa wells fargo dealer services and westlake financial services we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged and held by thirdparty providers and we periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

generally credit applications submitted by customers to carmax are initially reviewed by caf using our proprietary underwriting standards based on that review caf makes financing offers designed to create a loan portfolio that meets our targeted risk profile in the aggregate applications that caf declines or approves with conditions are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers thirdparty providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we refer to the providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as tier 3 providers we are willing to pay a fee to tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that they may not otherwise be able to obtain all fees either received or paid are prenegotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount financed the interest rate the term of the loan or the loantovalue ratio caf also provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a tier 3 provider however subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020 we paused our tier 3 lending in response to the covid19 situation 

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

suppliers for used vehicles 

we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process as well as through local regional and online auctions while in any individual period conditions may vary over the past 5 fiscal years 36 to 41 of our retail inventory has been acquired through our appraisal process annually we also acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental 

companies the used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market 

the supply of latemodel used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the volume of new vehicle sales which in turn generate used car tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry sources there were approximately 280 million light vehicles in operation in the us as of december 31 2019  during calendar year 2019  it is estimated that approximately 17 million new cars and 41 million used cars were sold at retail many of which were accompanied by tradeins and more than 20 million wholesale vehicles were sold at auctions and through other channels 

based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year consumer acceptance of our appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

seasonality 

historically our business has been seasonal our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer with an increase in traffic and sales in february and march coinciding with federal income tax refunds sales are typically slowest in the fall 

technology 

we leverage a combination of cloudbased and proprietary technologies our teams use a “test and learn” approach to iterate and deploy new technologyenabled solutions to our associates and customers carmax also has been developing advanced data science and machine learning capabilities to optimize our business as well as customer experience our business is supported by digital and mobile technologies that provide enhanced customer experience while enabling highly integrated automation of all operating functions including credit processing and supply chain management buyers and sales consultants are equipped with mobile and centralized tools that allow them to access realtime information to better serve our customers our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity 

our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location leveraging our more than twentyfive years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles our system generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that take into account factors that include sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

marketing and advertising 

our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmaxcom and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle these strategies are implemented through a broad range of media types including but not limited to traditional broadcast digital search video on demand and social our website and related mobile apps received an average of 25 million monthly visits during fiscal 2020 and are marketing tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail they are also sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct part of the shopping and sales process online our website and mobile apps also include a variety of other customer service features including the ability to initiate vehicle transfers schedule appointments and apply for financing preapproval information on the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated near realtime our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2020  approximately 93 of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online 

in 2019 we introduced a new advertising campaign  the way it should be  highlighting the human element that carmax provides to the car buying and selling experiences 

associates 

on february 29 2020  we had a total of 27050 full and parttime associates including 22272 hourly and salaried associates and 4778 sales associates who predominantly worked on a commission basis we employ additional associates during peak selling seasons we believe we have created a unique corporate culture and maintain good employee relations no associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement we focus on developing our associates and providing them with the information and resources 

they need to offer exceptional customer service and have been recognized for the success of our efforts by a number of external organizations 

in april 2020 in response to the covid19 situation we announced approximately 15500 associates have been placed on furlough effective april 18 2020 the majority of furloughed associates are employed at stores that are currently closed due to government mandates

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business sales results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

the recent outbreak of covid19 will likely have a significant negative impact on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

the global outbreak of covid19 has led to severe disruptions in general economic activities particularly retail operations as businesses and federal state and local governments take increasingly broad actions to mitigate this public health crisis we have experienced significant disruption to our business both in terms of disruption of our operations and the adverse effect on overall economic conditions we have closed or limited operations at many of our retail and wholesale locations since the beginning of the outbreak and the ultimate scope and duration of these closures is not known for stores that remain open consumer demand has deteriorated these conditions will significantly negatively impact all aspects of our business including used vehicle sales operations wholesale vehicle auctions used vehicle financing extended protection plan sales inventory acquisition and retail service the unexpected deterioration in economic conditions may also lead to future credit losses in our portfolio of auto loans receivable that are not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses our business is also dependent on the continued health and productivity of our associates including store region and corporate management teams throughout this crisis individually and collectively the consequences of the covid19 outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

additionally our liquidity could be negatively impacted if these conditions continue for a significant period of time and we may be required to pursue additional sources of financing to obtain working capital maintain appropriate inventory levels support the origination of auto loans receivable and meet our financial obligations currently capital and credit markets have been disrupted by the crisis and our ability to obtain any required financing is not guaranteed and largely dependent upon evolving market conditions and other factors depending on the continued impact of the crisis further actions may be required to improve the companys cash position and capital structure 

the extent to which the covid19 outbreak ultimately impacts our business sales results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and spread of the outbreak its severity the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume even after the covid19 outbreak has subsided we may continue to experience significant impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact including any economic downturn or recession that has occurred or may occur in the future 

the automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions these conditions could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to national and regional us economic conditions these conditions include but are not limited to recession inflation interest rates unemployment levels the state of the housing market gasoline prices consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general these conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as a global health crisis like covid19 and acts of terrorism when these economic conditions worsen or stagnate it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally demand from particular consumer categories or demand for particular vehicle types it can also negatively impact availability of credit to finance vehicle purchases for all or certain categories of consumers this could result in lower sales decreased margins on units sold and decreased profits for our caf segment worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of latemodel used vehicles as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time this could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold 

any significant change or deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon capital to operate fund growth and support the activities of our caf segment changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support the expansion of our store base and sales growth in existing stores could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth although in recent years internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to maintain our operations and fund our growth there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate sufficient cash for these purposes failure to do so—or our decision to put our cash to other uses—would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our growth 

changes in the availability or cost of the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loans receivable through caf could adversely affect sales and results of operations we use a securitization program to fund the majority of the auto loans 

receivable originated by caf changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our revolving credit facility term loan senior unsecured notes and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions—especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows—could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we operate in a highly competitive industry failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation’s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of the internet to market buy sell and finance used vehicles could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

  

automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers and online and mobile sales platforms as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices new car dealers leverage their franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers to brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax 

retail competition some of our competitors have replicated or attempted to replicate portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car store in 1993 including our use of competitive nohaggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer’s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us 

competitors using online focused business models both for direct sales and consumertoconsumer facilitation could materially impact our business model the online availability of used vehicle information including pricing information could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations if we fail to respond effectively to our retail competitors it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

online facilitation in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines and online classified sites that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmaxcom to attract traffic these companies could also make it more difficult for carmax to otherwise market its vehicles online 

the increasing use of the internet to facilitate consumers’ sales or tradeins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations for example online appraisal tools are available to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than carmax 

in addition there are companies that sell software and data solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to among other things more efficiently source and price inventory although these companies do not compete with carmax the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with carmax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of carmax’s internally developed proprietary systems 

if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures or to changes in the used vehicle marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

caf competition our caf segment is subject to competition from various financial institutions including banks and credit unions which provide vehicle financing to consumers if we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our thirdparty finance providers which are generally less profitable to carmax or through other outside financing sources moreover if caf competitors are able to attract potential customers before they visit carmax whether through competitive finance offers or ease of customer experience they may be directed to retail options other than carmax accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance 

offers to our customers or our finance competitors are able to successfully attract and redirect a disproportionate number of our potential customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

evolving marketplace the marketplace for used vehicles may be impacted by the significant and likely accelerating changes to the broader automotive industry technological changes including the development of autonomous vehicles new products and services new business models and new methods of travel could reduce automotive retail demand or disrupt our current business model if we fail to respond effectively to the evolving marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

carmax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering competitive nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and could involve among other things our sales process our provision of financing our reconditioning process or our treatment of customers even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results 

the use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected we monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns provide accurate information and protect our reputation but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our failure to realize the benefits associated with our omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we announced the rollout of a new omnichannel experience in december 2018 and by the end of fiscal 2020 our omnichannel experience was available to more than 60 of customers for our remaining markets we are pivoting to focus on rolling out the most pertinent parts of the experience as quickly and broadly as possible given current customer needs if we fail to complete this rollout if we are inefficient in implementing this rollout or if we are unable to capture the benefits that we expect from this rollout it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations in an evolving retail industry our business sales and results of operations may be negatively affected if we fail to provide a high quality and consistent customer experience regardless of sales channel if our omnichannel experience does not meet customer expectations or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the personnel at various levels who have the necessary skills and experience we need to implement our omnichannel initiatives 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our associates 

  

in april 2020 in response to the covid19 situation we announced approximately 15500 associates have been placed on furlough effective april 18 2020 our associates are the driving force behind our success we believe that one of the things that sets carmax apart is a culture centered on valuing all associates if we fail to maintain our culture while responding to the covid19 situation or in the aftermath of recovery and reintegration of furloughed associates it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

in addition our response to covid19 as well as our strategic initiatives require management employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities our failure to maintain this culture or to continue developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

in response to covid19 we have instituted a hiring freeze once that freeze is lifted we will need to recruit new associates and our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates our growth plans changes in employment legislation and competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and for service technicians in particular our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is also subject to our ability to maintain positive associate relations if we are unable to do so or 

if despite our efforts we become subject to successful unionization efforts it could increase costs limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our response to covid19 and our ongoing success also depend upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers a breach of this confidentiality whether due to a cybersecurity or other incident could result in harm to our customers and damage to our brand 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers this information includes the information customers provide when purchasing a vehicle and applying for vehicle financing we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential associate information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers although we have taken measures designed to safeguard such information and have received assurances from our thirdparty providers our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty providers could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events numerous national retailers have disclosed security breaches involving sophisticated cyberattacks that were not recognized or detected until after such retailers had been affected notwithstanding the preventive measures such retailers had in place any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or associate information whether experienced by us or by our thirdparty service providers and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident a programming error or other cause could damage our reputation expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement disrupt our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to such a security breach could exacerbate the consequences of the breach 

our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles 

any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for example if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap in addition any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins 

we may experience greater credit losses in caf’s portfolio of auto loans receivable than anticipated 

we are exposed to the risk that our customers who finance their purchases through caf will be unable or unwilling to repay their loans according to their terms and that the vehicle collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to ensure full repayment credit losses are inherent in caf’s business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we make various assumptions and judgments about caf’s portfolio of auto loans receivable and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors although management will establish an allowance for loan losses it believes is appropriate this allowance may not be adequate for example when economic conditions deteriorate unexpectedly such as in connection with the covid19 outbreak additional loan losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses may occur losses in excess of the existing allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory a failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory—or obstacles to acquiring inventory—whether because of supply competition or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

used vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk accordingly if we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we source a significant percentage of our vehicles though our appraisal process and these vehicles are generally more profitable for carmax accordingly if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or fail to recognize those trends it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory it could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from thirdparty auctions which is generally less profitable for carmax our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition both from new and used car dealers directly and through third parties driving appraisal traffic to those dealers see the risk factor above titled “ we operate in a highly competitive industry ” for discussion of this risk our ability to source vehicles from thirdparty auctions could be affected by an increase in the number of closed auctions that are open only to new car dealers who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers 

we rely on thirdparty finance providers to finance a significant portion of our customers’ vehicle purchases accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties 

we provide financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty finance providers if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide financing to our customers provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers to supply epp products to our customers accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these thirdparties 

we receive revenue for selling epp products on behalf of unrelated thirdparties who are the primary obligors if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide epp products make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations changes in these laws and regulations or our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations as well as changes in these laws and regulations and the manner in which they are interpreted or applied our sale of used vehicles is subject to state and local licensing requirements federal and state laws regulating vehicle advertising and state laws regulating vehicle sales and service our provision of vehicle financing is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies and large employers generally including privacy laws and federal employment practices securities and tax laws for additional discussion of these laws and regulations see the section of this form 10k titled “ business – laws and regulations ” 

the violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against our business operations any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations 

our failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our growth is dependent on the success of our omnichannel experience as well as on opening stores in new and existing markets and continued sales growth in our existing stores the omnichannel rollout and the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our information systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations sales growth in our existing stores requires that we continue to effectively execute our business strategies and implement new and ongoing initiatives to elevate the experience of our customers see the risk factor above titled “ our failure to realize the benefits associated with our omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations ” for more discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base and implementation of new initiatives also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion see the risk factor above titled “ our success depends upon the continued contributions of our associates ” for discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base also requires real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020 we paused our store expansion strategy and the implementation of certain of our customer experience initiatives in recognition of the potential impact of the covid19 health crisis on our business and financial condition while the ultimate duration and impact of this pause is unknown it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated information systems to run our business the failure of these systems or the inability to enhance our capabilities   could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to manage sales inventory our customerfacing websites and applications carmaxcom carmax mobile apps and carmaxauctionscom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary or the inability to enhance our information technology capabilities could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

despite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems we could be subjected to attacks by hackers including denialofservice attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations see the risk factor above titled “ we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers ” for the risks associated with a breach of confidential customer or associate information 

in addition covid19 may have an adverse impact on our information technology systems including telecommuting issues associated with certain associates working remotely or an increase in online transactions due to disruptions or closures of our retail store operations that overburdens our existing information technology systems 

we rely on thirdparty vendors for key components of our business 

many components of our business including data management key operational processes and critical customer systems are provided by third parties we carefully select our thirdparty vendors but we do not control their actions if our vendors fail to perform as we expect our operations and reputation could suffer if the failure harms the vendors’ ability to serve us and our customers one or more of these thirdparty vendors may experience financial distress staffing shortages or liquidity challenges file for bankruptcy protection go out of business or suffer disruptions in their business due to the covid19 outbreak the use of thirdparty vendors represents an unavoidable inherent risk to our company that could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we are subject to various legal proceedings if the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to carmax it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various litigation matters from time to time which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these claims could be asserted under a variety of laws including but not limited to consumer finance laws consumer protection laws intellectual property laws privacy laws labor and employment laws securities laws and employee benefit laws these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers including manufacturer recalls 

adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles including the supply of latemodel used vehicles in addition manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence because we do not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs some vehicles we sell may have unrepaired safety recalls such recalls and our lack of authorization to make recallrelated repairs could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our failure to realize the benefits associated with our strategic investments could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations and we may incur impairment losses on our strategic investments in equity securities 

from time to time carmax makes strategic investments and we currently hold noncontrolling investments in the equity securities of a number of companies for example in january 2020 we announced that we were partnering with and investing 50 million in edmunds for a minority stake in the company we may encounter difficulties in managing strategic investments and in assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of our business furthermore we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of these investments or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed while our evaluation of any potential transaction includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential benefits and risks of a particular investment 

additionally under gaap if any investment’s fair value declines below its carrying value we will need to record an impairment loss in the applicable fiscal period as a result we may incur expenses related to the impairment of existing or future equity investments any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates as well as changes in accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of carmax’s assets liabilities revenues expenses and earnings if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 

the implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon our operating results general economic and market conditions general trends and prospects for our industry announcements by our competitors and other factors in addition the market price of our common stock may also be affected by whether we meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation may be initiated if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property which could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

protecting our intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights confidential information and trade secrets is integral to our business the failure to protect our intellectual property including from unauthorized uses can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is sensitive to weather events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain hail snow wind storms hurricanes extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

we are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated 

our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us california texas and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in 

the event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

we conduct our retail vehicle operations primarily in two formats – production and nonproduction stores production stores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production stores have more service bays and require additional space for reconditioning activities and therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction store on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some stores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction stores until we expand our presence in that market we also have production and nonproduction stores that operate in metropolitan statistical areas “msas” of less than 600000 people which we define as small markets some of these stores also have a smaller footprint compared with our stores in larger markets 

u sed c ar s tores b y f ormat as of f ebruary 29 2020

our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services such as wholesale vehicle sales the sale of extended protection plan “epp” products which include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” and vehicle repair service we offer competitive nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles valueadded epp products and superior customer service our website and related mobile apps are tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct all or part of the shopping and sales process online 

our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us and availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the sales process we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with industryleading thirdparty finance providers all of the finance offers whether by caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option 

as of february 29 2020  we operated 216 used car stores in 106 us television markets as of that date we also conducted wholesale auctions at 74 used car stores and we operated 2 new car franchises 

carmax auto finance 

in addition to thirdparty finance providers we provide vehicle financing through caf which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option as a result we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loans receivable less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 425 of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2020  as of february 29 2020  caf serviced approximately 1036000 customer accounts in its 1362 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

management regularly analyzes caf’s operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer profitability the performance of the auto loans receivable including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses 

revenues and profitability 

our primary sources of revenue and gross profit from carmax sales operations for fiscal 2020 are as follows 



a highlevel summary of our financial results from fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 is as follows 



refer to “results of operations” for further details on our revenues and profitability a discussion regarding results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 is included in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 28 2019 filed with the sec on april 19 2019 

impact of covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of covid19 as a global pandemic and in the following weeks many us states and localities issued lockdown orders impacting the operations of our stores and consumer demand we are following the mandates from public health officials and government agencies including implementation of enhanced cleaning measures social distancing guidelines and in many localities the closing of stores and wholesale auctions we continue to monitor the situation closely and it is possible that we will implement further measures 

the positive sales momentum experienced in fiscal 2020 carried into the beginning of march with robust comparable store used unit sales through the first week of the month since then the covid19 situation within the us has rapidly escalated and approximately half of our stores have been closed or have run under limited operations based upon the fluidity of the current environment we expect that stores will continue to reopen or close in accordance with government mandates or public health concerns consumer demand has deteriorated and sales have dropped significantly most of our stores that remain open are selling 50 or less of what they sold last year a trend that continued into april 2020 for wholesale we have moved many of our auctions to an online platform as a number of our auction locations are closed we expect our sales to continue to be impacted during fiscal 2021 but the extent and duration of those impacts remains uncertain at this time we also anticipate pressure on our gross profit per unit in the nearterm as we attempt to rightsize our inventory levels in light of the current environment 

caf loan origination volume has been consistent with our sales performance noted above during the second half of march and continuing into april 2020 we have seen an increase in delinquencies and greater demand for payment extensions we expect our loan portfolio to continue to be negatively impacted during fiscal 2021 but the extent and duration of those impacts remains uncertain at this time similarly while we anticipate some unfavorable loss experience as a result of the covid19 situation we are unable to determine the impact on our future results at this time 

at caf we have begun to implement a variety of measures to support our customers through this difficult time and enhance longterm collectability for the portfolio this includes suspending repossessions waiving late fees and providing loan payment extensions where appropriate we have also mobilized our associates to work remotely while responding to the increasing demands of our customers given the current economic outlook we have also paused our inhouse tier 3 lending we have made no changes to our core lending standards but are monitoring trends in customer demographics and credit mix and will adjust accordingly 

we have taken certain measures in response to the covid19 situation subsequent to the end of our fiscal year to enhance our liquidity position and provide additional financial flexibility including drawing down additional funds on our revolving credit facility during march 2020 we made net borrowings under this facility of approximately 675 million  following which more than 300 million in unused borrowing capacity remained as of march 31 2020 we had approximately 700 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and more than 25 billion of inventory we also owned real estate and buildings at more than 140 locations across the country with a net book value in excess of 18 billion 

in addition we halted our stock repurchase program although the repurchase authorization remains effective and temporarily paused our store expansion strategy and remodels 

in order to best position ourselves to emerge in strong financial health after the covid19 situation stabilizes we have begun reducing inventory levels and aligning operating expenses to the state of the business this includes implementing a hiring freeze reducing advertising spending and reducing labor hours 

in april 2020 we announced approximately 15500 associates have been placed on furlough effective april 18 2020 the majority of furloughed associates are employed at stores that are currently closed due to government mandates prior to the effective date of any furlough we provided transition pay to each impacted associate in addition for furloughed associates enrolled in our medical plan we are paying the current cost of the associate’s portion of the medical plan plus the employer portion until further notice we are also providing resources to help associates understand the changes and take advantage of the assistance available under the new cares act which should provide significant financial support for most furloughed employees additionally our president and ceo is forgoing 50 of his salary each member of our senior leadership team is taking a reduction in pay until further notice and our board of directors has unanimously determined to forgo their cash retainer indefinitely 

due to the uncertainty as to the severity and duration of the pandemic the full impact on our revenues profitability financial position and liquidity is uncertain at this time though it is important to note that the impacts on our fiscal 2020 results as described herein were not significant 

liquidity 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from nonrecourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources during fiscal 2020  net cash used in operations totaled 2366 million  this amount combined with 108 billion of net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable resulted in 8413 million of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities a nongaap measure this liquidity was primarily used to fund the 70 million common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program our store growth and strategic initiatives 

when considering cash from operating activities management does not include increases in auto loans receivable that have been funded with nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities for a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in provided by operating activities the most directly 

comparable gaap financial measure see “reconciliation of adjusted net cash from operating activities” included in “financial condition – liquidity and capital resources” 

as noted above in response to the covid19 situation we have taken certain measures subsequent to the end of our fiscal year to enhance our liquidity position and provide additional financial flexibility including drawing down additional funds on our revolving credit facility halting our stock repurchase program pausing our store expansion strategy and remodels and actively aligning operating expenses to the current state of the business including our recently announced furlough of approximately 15500 associates in april 2020 our current capital allocation strategy is to prioritize navigating the nearterm challenges that covid19 presents and continuing to fund operating activities 

future outlook 

the covid19 situation has created an unprecedented and challenging time our current focus is on positioning the company for a strong recovery when this crisis is over as discussed above we have taken several steps to enhance our liquidity position and provide additional financial flexibility we have also taken steps to begin reducing our inventory and align our operating expenses to the state of the business we plan to continue to keep our stores open where permitted to support our customers’ needs for reliable vehicles and to provide as many jobs as possible for our associates as noted above approximately 15500 associates were placed on furlough effective april 18 2020 any ongoing furlough determinations are subject to change due to future government mandates as well as future business conditions we will continue to monitor the covid19 situation and look for ways to preserve cash and reduce our operating expenses as we are able in the nearterm we are pivoting the rollout of our omni experience and implementing the most pertinent parts of the experience such as online selfprogression and curbside or express pick up as quickly and broadly as possible given the current needs of our customers 

our longterm strategy continues to be focused on completing the rollout of our retail concept including our omnichannel experience and to increase our share of used vehicle unit sales in each of the markets in which we operate our omnichannel experience empowers customers to buy a car on their own terms whether completely from home instore or through a seamlessly integrated combination of online and instore experiences we believe that over the long term used vehicle unit sales are the primary driver for earnings growth we also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and over time increased caf income 

in calendar 2019 we estimate we sold approximately 47 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate and approximately 35 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold on a nationwide basis our strategy to increase our market share includes focusing on 

 

in order to execute our longterm strategy we have invested in various strategic initiatives to increase innovation specifically with regards to customer facing and customerenabling technologies we continue to make improvements to our website and enhance customer experiences such as finance preapproval home delivery online appraisal and express or curbside pickup we are also developing and implementing tools that help our associates be more efficient and effective additionally we have centralized customer support in our customer experience centers “cec” which we believe provides a more seamless integration between the online and instore experience for our customers our use of data is a core component of these initiatives and continues to be a strategic asset for us as we leverage data to enhance the customer experience and increase operational efficiencies 

in december 2018 we launched our omnichannel car buying experience in the atlanta market during fiscal 2020  we continued this rollout to additional markets making the omnichannel experience available to more than 60 of our customers for our remaining markets in response to the covid19 health crisis we are pivoting and implementing the most relevant parts of the omni experience given the current needs of our customers 

as of february 29 2020  we had used car stores located in 106 television markets which covered approximately 78 of the us population the format and operating models utilized in stores are continuously evaluated and may evolve over time based upon market and consumer expectations we opened 13 stores in fiscal 2020  1 store in march of fiscal 2021 and 1 store under limited operations in april of fiscal 2021 prior to the recent covid19 situation in the us it was our intent to open 13 stores during 

fiscal 2021 and a similar number of stores in fiscal 2022  given the current environment we have paused our store expansion strategy until the covid19 situation stabilizes 

while we execute both our short and longterm strategy there are trends and factors that could impact our strategic approach or our results in the short and medium term for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company see “risk factors” included in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 1 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed additionally we expect that the covid19 outbreak in march 2020 will impact future assumptions and estimates made related to the critical accounting policies listed below though the extent of those impacts is uncertain at this time 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving funding program composed of three warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loans receivable originated by caf we typically elect to fund these receivables through an assetbacked term funding transaction such as a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement at a later date we recognize transfers of auto loans receivable into the warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions including term securitizations together “nonrecourse funding vehicles” as secured borrowings which result in recording the auto loans receivable and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loans receivable less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses 

see notes 1f 1h and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loans receivable 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date such losses are expected to become evident during the following 12 months because net loss performance can vary substantially over time estimating net losses requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain 

the allowance for loan losses is estimated using a combination of analytical models and management judgment these models are primarily based on the composition of the portfolio of managed receivables including month of origination and actual prior performance of the receivables historical observation periods and net loss data the period of time between the loss event inherent in the portfolio and the chargeoff date and forecasted forward loss curves for receivables that have less than 18 months of performance history the estimate also takes into account the credit grades of the receivables and historical losses by credit grade to supplement actual loss data in estimating future performance subsequent to which the estimate reflects actual loss experience of those receivables to date along with forward loss curves to predict future performance the forward loss curves are constructed using historical performance data and show the average timing of losses over the course of a receivable’s life 

estimates from these models rely on historical performance information and may not fully reflect losses inherent in the present portfolio therefore management also considers recent trends in delinquencies and defaults recovery rates and the economic environment in assessing the models used in estimating the allowance for loan losses and may adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect factors that may not be captured in the models in addition management periodically considers whether the use of additional metrics would result in improved model performance and revises the models when appropriate 

determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses requires management to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain including the timing and distribution of net losses that could materially affect the allowance for loan losses and therefore net earnings to the extent that actual performance differs from our estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce net earnings a 10 change in the estimated loss rates would have changed the allowance for loan losses by approximately 158 million as of february 29 2020  

see notes 1h and 4 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 7‑day moneyback guarantee we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors to customers who purchase a retail vehicle the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their retail installment contract we recognize revenue on a net basis at the time of sale we also record a reserve or refund liability for estimated contract cancellations the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience recent trends and credit mix of the customer base our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of epp sales customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates a 10 change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately 118 million as of february 29 2020  see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves 

we are contractually entitled to receive profitsharing revenues based on the performance of the esps administered by third parties these revenues are a form of variable consideration included in epp revenues to the extent that it is probable that it will not result in a significant revenue reversal an estimate of the amount to which we expect to be entitled subject to various constraints is recognized upon satisfying the performance obligation of selling the esp these constraints include factors that are outside of the company’s influence or control and the length of time until settlement we apply the expected value method utilizing historical claims and cancellation data from carmax customers as well as external data and other qualitative assumptions this estimate is reassessed each reporting period with changes reflected in other sales and revenues on our consolidated statements of earnings and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 

customers applying for financing who are not approved or are conditionally approved by caf are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we recognize these fees at the time of sale 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales

during fiscal 2020  we opened 13 stores including six stores in new television markets waco tx mcallen tx lubbock tx palm springs ca gulfport ms and ft wayne in and seven stores in existing television markets memphis tn san francisco ca phoenix az dallas tx atlanta ga portland or and nashville tn 

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019  the 132 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to an 112 increase in unit sales the increase in used unit sales included a 77 increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit sales performance reflected strong conversion which was aided by continued support from our thirdparty lending partners and growth in selling opportunities eg web and phone leads which we believe benefited from both our national marketing campaign and the favorable response to our consumer initiatives we believe that solid execution in operations finance customer progression and marketing in addition to an overall favorable used car sales environment also contributed to our sales growth our data indicates that our share of the age 0 to 10year old used vehicles in our current comparable store markets increased approximately 42 to 47 in calendar 2019 

the increase in used unit comparable sales in fiscal 2020 was slightly stronger in markets offering a full omnichannel experience additionally many of our omnichannel related digital initiatives including improved customer lead management tools finance selfservice tools and digital merchandising have been rolled out nationwide we believe these initiatives supported our strong used unit comparable sales performance in markets both with and without the full omnichannel experience we also believe all stores benefited from our national marketing campaign launched in october 

the increase in average retail selling price reflected higher vehicle acquisition costs as well as shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class 

wholesale vehicle sales 

vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are on average approximately 10 years old with more than 100000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold 

fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019  the 45 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to a 42 increase in wholesale unit sales the wholesale unit growth was primarily driven by an increase in our appraisal buy rate and the growth in our store base partially offset by lower appraisal traffic we achieved a record buy rate in fiscal 2020 wholesale vehicle average selling price for fiscal 2020 remained consistent with the prior year 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of esps and gap collectively reported in epp revenues net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are predominantly comprised of service department and new vehicle sales the fees we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers the mix of our retail vehicles financed by caf tier 2 and tier 3 providers or customers that arrange their own financing may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants changes in providers’ credit decisioning and external market conditions changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers 

fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019  other sales and revenues increased 71 in fiscal 2020  driven by the 144 increase in epp revenues the increase in epp revenues reflected the combined effects of our used unit growth increased margins and increased profitsharing revenues these increases were partially offset by the net effects of a 152 million favorable adjustment to cancellation reserves during fiscal 2019 and a 23 million unfavorable adjustment in fiscal 2020 we recognized 203 million in profitsharing revenue during fiscal 2020 an increase of 119 million over the prior year we received payments of 460 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 representing the profitsharing accrued during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 which was based on claims experience from calendar years 2016 through 2019 in future years we expect epp profitsharing revenue will be less material as it will reflect only a single incremental year versus four years of activity

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit 

we systematically adjust individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include the wholesale and retail vehicle pricing environments vehicle reconditioning and logistics costs and the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels 

fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019  the 117 increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by the 112 growth in total used unit sales our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2019  we believe we can manage to a targeted gross profit per unit dollar range subject to future changes to our business pricing strategy or external market conditions 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit 

fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019  the 54 increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2020 was driven by both the 42 increase in wholesale unit sales and a slight increase in wholesale gross profit per unit 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are predominantly comprised of service department operations including used vehicle reconditioning and new vehicle sales we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent revenues paid to us by certain thirdparty providers thirdparty finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to thirdparty tier 3 finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019  other gross profit rose 64 in fiscal 2020  primarily reflecting the growth in epp revenues discussed above offset by a decline in service department profits of 254 million service profits were adversely affected by a recent increase in our postsale warranty period from 30 to 90 days and nearterm inefficiencies resulting from our recent ramp in technician hiring 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not had a significant impact on results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices however we believe higher vehicle acquisition prices have adversely impacted and could impact in the future our comparable store used unit sales growth changes in average vehicle selling prices also impact caf income to the extent the average amount financed also changes

fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019 increase of 2098 million or 121  in addition to the 6 growth in our store base during fiscal 2020 representing the addition of 13 stores higher costs associated with our comparable store unit growth and continued spending to advance our technology platforms and support our core and omnichannel initiatives the net increase also reflected the following 



 

interest expense 

interest expense includes the interest related to short and longterm debt financing obligations and finance lease obligations it does not include interest on the nonrecourse notes payable which is reflected within caf income 

fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2019  interest expense increased to 830 million in fiscal 2020 versus 758 million in fiscal 2019  the increase primarily reflected higher outstanding debt levels and an increase in finance lease obligations in fiscal 2020  

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was consistent with the prior year at 235 in fiscal 2020 versus 243 in fiscal 2019  

results of operations – carmax auto finance 

caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by caf’s portfolio of auto loans receivable less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses total interest margin reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time increases in interest rates which affect caf’s funding costs or other competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in compression in the interest margin on new originations changes in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables reflect the effect of the change in loss and delinquency experience on our outlook for net losses expected to occur over the next 12 months 

caf’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multiyear period we strive to originate loans with an underlying risk profile that we believe will in the aggregate and excluding caf’s tier 3 originations result in cumulative net losses in the 2 to 25 range over the life of the loans actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations economic conditions including the possible effects of the covid19 outbreak and wholesale recovery rates current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business including the volume of loans originated current interest rates charged to consumers loan terms and average credit scores because we recognize caf income over the life of the underlying auto loan loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period’s financial results 

caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses

tier 3 loan originations caf also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers in order to better understand the performance of these loans mitigate risk and add incremental profits historically caf has targeted originating approximately 5 of the total tier 3 loan volume however this rate may vary over time based on market conditions a total of 1675 million and 1624 million in caf tier 3 receivables were outstanding as of february 29 2020 and february 28 2019  respectively these loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the caf portfolio as well as higher contract rates as of february 29 2020 and february 28 2019  approximately 10 of the total allowance for loan losses related to the outstanding caf tier 3 loan balances subsequent to the end of fiscal 2020 we paused our caf tier 3 lending given the current economic outlook and uncertainty surrounding the covid19 outbreak 

planned future activities 

  

in march 2020 we opened one store in an existing market tampa fl in april 2020 we opened one store under limited operations in an existing market philadelphia pa previously it was our intent to open 13 stores in fiscal 2021 and a similar number of stores in fiscal 2022  while we remain committed to executing our store growth plan for the longterm benefit of customers and shareholders we have decided to pause our store expansion and remodel strategy until the covid19 situation stabilizes

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations store expansion and improvement and caf since fiscal 2013 we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from nonrecourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources 

we currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35 to 45 at the end of fiscal 2020 our adjusted debt to capital ratio was at the lower end of our targeted range in calculating this ratio we utilize total debt excluding nonrecourse notes payable finance lease liabilities a multiple of eight times rent expense and total shareholders’ equity generally we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources together with stock repurchases to maintain this targeted ratio however in any period we may be outside this range due to seasonal market strategic or other factors 

  

we ended fiscal 2020 with a healthy liquidity position in response to the covid19 crisis we are taking immediate and proactive measures to bolster our liquidity position and provide additional financial flexibility to improve our ability to meet our shortterm liquidity needs these measures include drawing down additional funds on our revolving credit facility halting our stock repurchase program pausing our store expansion strategy and actively aligning operating expenses to the current state of the business including our recently announced furlough of approximately 15500 associates in april 2020 our current capital allocation strategy is to prioritize navigating the nearterm challenges that covid19 presents and continuing to fund operating activities 

operating activities  during fiscal 2020  net cash used in operating activities totaled 2366 million compared with net cash provided by operating activities of 1630 million in fiscal 2019  which included increases in auto loans receivable of 131 billion in fiscal 2020 and 105 billion in fiscal 2019  the majority of the increases in auto loans receivable are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities 

  

as of february 29 2020  total inventory was 285 billion  representing an increase of 3270 million  or 130  compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year the increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support our comparable store sales growth including seasonal sales opportunities and new store openings in fiscal 2020  the increase also reflects a higher average carrying cost of inventory due to changes in our vehicle mix 

when considering cash from operating activities management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loans receivable with the corresponding changes in nonrecourse notes payable this is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable which represents the increase in auto loans receivable that were funded through the issuance of nonrecourse notes payable during the year the resulting financial measure adjusted net cash from operating activities is a nongaap financial measure we believe adjusted net cash from operating activities 

is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations including the increases in nonrecourse notes payable net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows

compared with fiscal 2019  the decrease in fiscal 2020 adjusted net cash provided by operating activities reflected the changes in inventory discussed above timing and use of nonrecourse funding vehicles in relation to originations of auto loans receivable and timingrelated changes to accounts receivable and other current assets partially offset by an increase in net earnings when excluding noncash expenses which include depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation expense and the provisions for loan losses and cancellation reserves 

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities totaled 3894 million in fiscal 2020 and 3085 million in fiscal 2019  investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled 3319 million in fiscal 2020 and 3046 million in fiscal 2019  capital expenditures primarily include store construction costs real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store remodeling expenses we maintain a multiyear pipeline of sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years we opened 13 stores in fiscal 2020 and 15 stores in fiscal 2019  

  

financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities totaled 6870 million in fiscal 2020 and 1860 million in fiscal 2019  included in these amounts were net increases in total nonrecourse notes payable of 108 billion and 8908 million  respectively which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of 131 billion and 105 billion  respectively in auto loans receivable see operating activities during fiscal 2020  we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by 862 million  compared with increased net borrowings of 1689 million during fiscal 2019  net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of 5677 million in fiscal 2020 and 9047 million in fiscal 2019

borrowings under our 145 billion unsecured revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us the credit facility term loan and senior note agreements contain 

representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements are not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity as of february 29 2020  we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of that date our performance under these covenants could degrade such that if the covenant ratios were to double we would still remain in compliance 

see note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility term loan senior notes and financing obligations 

caf auto loans receivable are primarily funded through our warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions these nonrecourse funding vehicles are structured to legally isolate the auto loans receivable and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our nonrecourse funding vehicles even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the related receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loans receivable we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these nonrecourse funding vehicles 

as of february 29 2020  1143 billion and 218 billion of nonrecourse notes payable were outstanding related to assetbacked term funding transactions and our warehouse facilities respectively during fiscal 2020  we funded a total of 611 billion in assetbacked term funding transactions 

we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time as our store base sales and caf loan originations have grown see notes 1f and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

we generally repurchase the receivables funded through our warehouse facilities when we enter into an assetbacked term funding transaction if our counterparties were to refuse to permit these repurchases it could impact our ability to execute on our funding program additionally the agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to fund receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the related receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

currently the assetbacked term funding market has been disrupted by the effects of the covid19 outbreak as of february 29 2020 we had 132 billion of unused capacity in our warehouse facilities while we believe this capacity is sufficient to support caf activity for several months particularly in the current sales environment we are actively assessing alternatives in the event that the assetbacked securities market remains disrupted for an extended period of time 

the timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on stock price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock as of february 29 2020  a total of 2 billion of board authorizations for repurchases were outstanding with no expiration date at that date 155 billion remained available for repurchase subsequent to the end of the fiscal year we halted our stock repurchase program although the repurchase authorization remains effective see note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity

 additionally we had 9973 million in unused capacity on our revolving credit facility as of february 29 2020  during march 2020 we made net borrowings under this facility of approximately 675 million  following which more than 300 million in unused borrowing capacity remained 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure  nonrecourse notes payable 

as of february 29 2020 and february 28 2019  all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved primarily through nonrecourse funding vehicles that in turn issued both fixed and variablerate notes nonrecourse funding vehicles include warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions 

borrowings under our warehouse facilities are variablerate debt and are secured by auto loans receivable the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through an assetbacked term funding transaction which issue notes payable that accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates 

interest rate risk related to variablerate debt is primarily mitigated by entering into derivative instruments our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loans receivable disruptions in the credit markets or unexpected changes in prepayment activity could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

absent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk a 100basis point increase in market interest rates associated with nonrecourse funding vehicles would have decreased our fiscal 2020 net earnings per share by approximately 010  

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities

interest rate exposure  other debt 

we have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our term loan however a portion of the variablerate risk is mitigated by a derivative instrument substantially all of these borrowings are variablerate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2020 net earnings per share by approximately 002  

other market exposures 

our pension plan has interest rate risk related to its projected benefit obligation “pbo” due to the relatively young overall age of the plan’s participants a 100basis point change in the discount rate has approximately a 20 effect on the pbo balance a 100basis point decrease in the discount rate would have decreased our fiscal 2020 net earnings per share by less than 001  see note 10 for more information on our benefit plans 

  

as our cashsettled restricted stock units are liability awards the related compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the company’s stock price the marktomarket effect on the liability depends on each award’s grant price and previously recognized expense at february 29 2020  a 10 change in the company’s stock price would have affected fiscal 2020 net earnings per share by approximately 004

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background 

carmax inc delivers an unrivaled customer experience by offering a broad selection of quality used vehicles and related products and services at competitive nohaggle prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility as well as through carmaxcom and our mobile apps we are in the process of rolling out our new omnichannel car buying experience which provides customers a choice as to how they want to buy a car from home instore or a combination of both we have launched our omnichannel experience in the atlanta market and we anticipate having it available to the majority of our customers by the end of fiscal 2020 we are the nation’s largest retailer of used cars and we sold 748961  used vehicles at retail during the fiscal year ended february 28 2019  we are also one of the nation’s largest operators of wholesale vehicle auctions and one of the nation’s largest providers of used vehicle financing 

carmax was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax store in richmond virginia on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company as of february 28 2019  we operated 203  used car stores in 100  us television markets our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

carmax business 

we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations   our carmax sales operations segment sells used vehicles purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources sells related products and services and arranges financing options for customers all for fixed nohaggle prices we enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer 

purchasing a vehicle  

the vehicle purchase process at carmax differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience our nohaggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for other consumer products as we roll out our new omnichannel experience our customers will be empowered to buy a car on their own terms either completely from home instore or through an integrated combination of online and instore experiences 

our sales consultants are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate this pay structure aligns our sales associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

we recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our carmax quality certified standards and each vehicle must pass an inspection before being offered for sale we stand behind every used vehicle we sell with a 7day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty our carmax quality certified standards were developed internally by carmax and are not affiliated with any third party or original equipment manufacturer program 

we maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory of approximately 70000  retail vehicles as of february 28 2019  available for viewing on carmaxcom as well as our mobile apps upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our inventory this gives carmax customers access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer in fiscal 2019  approximately 34  of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request 

in addition to retailing used vehicles we sell new vehicles at two  locations under franchise agreements 

selling us a vehicle  

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a customer’s vehicle free of charge and make a written guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us this nohaggle offer is good for seven days 

based on age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through our appraisal process meet our retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers as of february 28 2019  we conducted wholesale auctions at 76  of our 203  stores during fiscal 2019  we sold 447491  wholesale vehicles through these auctions with an average auction sales rate of approximately 95  

financing a vehicle  

the availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process and having an array of finance sources increases approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax our finance program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both caf and thirdparty providers we believe that our processes and systems transparency of pricing and vehicle quality as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit allow caf and our thirdparty providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment all finance offers whether from caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge 

related products and services  

we provide customers with a range of other related products and services including extended protection plan “epp” products and vehicle repair service epp products include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” which is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business in fiscal 2019  approximately 61  of the customers who purchased a retail used vehicle also purchased an esp and approximately 18  purchased gap 

carmax auto finance   caf provides financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history and other credit data of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely to carmax customers our scoring models are optimized for the carmax channel we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 432  of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2019  

caf also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements collecting payments maintaining contact with delinquent customers and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans as of february 28 2019  caf serviced approximately 966000  customer accounts in its 1251 billion  portfolio of managed receivables 

competition 

carmax sales operations   the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and we face competition from franchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles online sellers independent used car dealers and private parties according to industry sources as of december 31 2018  there were approximately 18000  franchised dealers in the us who we consider to be our primary retail competitors as they sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles competition in our industry has evolved with the adoption of online platforms and marketing tools all of which facilitate increased competition 

based on industry data there were approximately 42 million  used cars sold in the us in calendar 2018  of which approximately 22 million  were estimated to be age 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us in calendar 2018  we estimate we sold approximately 44  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate a decrease in these markets from approximately 45 in calendar 2017 our market share is generally the highest in markets in which we have been established for many years entering new markets could have a dampening effect on our market share given that our initial market share in new markets is generally much lower than our average on a nationwide basis we estimate we sold approximately 33  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in calendar year 2018  

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our competitive nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on site and via carmaxcom and our mobile apps the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems the transparency and availability of caf and thirdparty financing the locations of our retail stores and our commitment to evolving our carbuying experience to meet customers’ changing expectations we believe our new omnichannel experience will reinforce our competitive advantages and anticipate having it available to the majority of our customers by the end of fiscal 2020 in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our high volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards 

our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast to the highly fragmented used vehicle retail market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc which together represent an estimated 70  of the north american wholesale car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax’s auctions predominantly sell older higher mileage vehicles 

carmax auto finance   caf operates and is a significant participant in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies according to industry sources this sector represented more than 1 trillion  in outstanding receivables as of december 31 2018  caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars 

we believe that caf’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source for carmax customers and that caf’s primary driver for growth is the growth in carmax’s retail used unit sales we periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness we also monitor 3day payoffs as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our offer 

products and services 

retail merchandising   we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including domestic imported and luxury vehicles at competitive prices our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old these vehicles generally range in price from 11000 to 35000 the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences seasonality and market availability 

wholesale auctions   the typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase our auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis 

  

extended protection plans   at the time of sale we offer customers epp products we receive revenue for selling these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors we have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements the esps we currently offer on all used retail vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract the epps that we sell other than manufacturer programs on new car sales have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements periodically we may receive profitsharing revenues based upon the performance of the policies administered by the third parties 

reconditioning and service   an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our internal standards before it can become a carmax quality certified vehicle this process includes an inspection of the engine and all major systems based on this inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our internal quality standards many of our stores depend upon nearby typically larger carmax stores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services including but not limited to services related to manufacturer’s warranties we engage third parties specializing in those services carmax does not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs and some vehicles carmax sells may have unrepaired safety recalls however we review any unrepaired safety recall information as reported by the national highway traffic safety administration with our used vehicle customers before purchase 

all carmax used car stores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by the esps we sell additionally we have partnered with thirdparty providers of auto service and repair through these partnerships we are able to provide our customers with access to a nationwide network of trusted quality and fairpriced service and repair locations 

customer credit   we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and arrangements with several financial institutions vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicle as of february 28 2019  our thirdparty finance providers included ally financial american credit acceptance capital one auto finance chase auto finance exeter finance corp santander consumer usa wells fargo dealer services and westlake financial services we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged and held by thirdparty providers and we periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

generally credit applications submitted by customers to carmax are initially reviewed by caf using our proprietary underwriting standards based on that review caf makes financing offers designed to create a loan portfolio that meets our targeted risk profile in the aggregate applications that caf declines or approves with conditions are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers thirdparty providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we refer to the providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as tier 3 providers we are willing to pay a fee to tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that they may not otherwise be able to obtain all fees either received or paid are prenegotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount financed the interest rate the term of the loan or the loantovalue ratio caf also provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a tier 3 provider 

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

suppliers for used vehicles 

we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process as well as through local regional and online auctions while in any individual period conditions may vary over the past 10 fiscal years 38 to 52 of our retail inventory has been acquired through our appraisal process annually we also acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market 

the supply of latemodel used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the volume of new vehicle sales which in turn generate used car tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry sources there were approximately 275 million  light vehicles in operation in the us as of december 31 2018  during calendar year 2018  it is estimated that approximately 17 million  new cars and 42 million  used cars were sold at retail many of which were accompanied by tradeins and more than 20 million  wholesale vehicles were sold at auctions and through other channels 

based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year consumer acceptance of our appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

seasonality 

historically our business has been seasonal our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter we typically experience an increase in traffic and sales in february and march coinciding with federal income tax refunds 

systems 

our business is supported by proprietary digital and mobile technologies that provide enhanced customer experience while enabling highly integrated automation of all operating functions including credit processing and supply chain management buyers and sales consultants are equipped with mobile and centralized tools that allow them to access realtime information to better serve our customers our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity 

our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location leveraging our more than twentyfive years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles our system 

generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that take into account factors that include sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

marketing and advertising 

our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmaxcom and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle these strategies are implemented through a broad range of media types our website and related mobile apps are marketing tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct part of the shopping and sales process online our website and mobile apps also include a variety of other customer service features including the ability to initiate vehicle transfers schedule appointments and apply for financing preapproval information on the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated several times per day our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2019  approximately 90  of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online 

associates 

on february 28 2019  we had a total of 25946  full and parttime associates including 19705  hourly and salaried associates and 6241  sales associates who predominantly worked on a commission basis we employ additional associates during peak selling seasons we believe we have created a unique corporate culture and maintain good employee relations no associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement we focus on developing our associates and providing them with the information and resources they need to offer exceptional customer service and have been recognized for the success of our efforts by a number of external organizations 

intellectual property 

our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy our principal trademarks including carmax and the related family of marks have been registered with the us patent and trademark office

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business sales results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

we operate in a highly competitive   industry failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation’s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of the internet to market buy sell and finance used vehicles could adversely affect   our business sales and results of operations 

  

automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers and online and mobile sales platforms as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices new car dealers including publicly traded auto retailers have increased their sales of used vehicles in recent years these new car dealers also leverage their franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers to brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax 

retail competition   some of our competitors have announced and begun to execute plans for rapid expansion including into markets with carmax locations some of our competitors have also replicated or attempted to replicate portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car store in 1993 including our use of competitive nohaggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer’s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us if we fail to respond effectively to our retail competitors it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

online sales and facilitation   the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles and to provide vehicle financing could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations competitors using online focused business models both for direct sales and consumertoconsumer facilitation could materially impact our business model the online availability of used vehicle information including pricing information could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines and online classified sites that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmaxcom to attract traffic these companies could also make it more difficult for carmax to otherwise market its vehicles online 

the increasing use of the internet to facilitate consumers’ sales or tradeins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations for example online appraisal tools are available to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than carmax 

in addition to the direct competition and increasing use of the internet described above there are companies that sell software and data solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to among other things more efficiently source and price inventory although these companies do not compete with carmax the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with carmax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of carmax’s internally developed proprietary systems 

if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures or to changes in the used vehicle marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

caf competition   our caf segment is subject to competition from various financial institutions including banks and credit unions which provide vehicle financing to consumers if we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our thirdparty finance providers which are generally less profitable to carmax or through other outside financing sources moreover if caf competitors are able to attract potential customers before they visit carmax whether through competitive finance offers or ease of customer experience they may be directed to retail options other than carmax accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance 

offers to our customers or our finance competitors are able to successfully attract and redirect a disproportionate number of our potential customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

evolving marketplace   the marketplace for used vehicles may be impacted by the significant and likely accelerating changes to the broader automotive industry technological changes including the development of autonomous vehicles new products and services new business models and new methods of travel could reduce automotive retail demand or disrupt our current business model if we fail to respond effectively to the evolving marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

carmax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our   business sales and results of operations 

our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering competitive nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and could involve among other things our sales process our provision of financing our reconditioning process or our treatment of customers even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results 

the use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected we monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns provide accurate information and protect our reputation but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions these conditions could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to national and regional us economic conditions these conditions include but are not limited to recession inflation interest rates unemployment levels the state of the housing market gasoline prices consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general these conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as acts of terrorism when these economic conditions worsen or stagnate it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally demand from particular consumer categories or demand for particular vehicle types it can also negatively impact availability of credit to finance vehicle purchases for all or certain categories of consumers this could result in lower sales decreased margins on units sold and decreased profits for our caf segment worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of latemodel used vehicles as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time this could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold 

  

any significant change or deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

our failure to realize the benefits associated with our omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we have announced the rollout of a new omnichannel experience with plans to make it available to the majority of our customers by february 2020 if we fail to complete this rollout or if we are inefficient in managing this rollout it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations in an evolving retail industry our business sales and results of operations may be negatively affected if we fail to provide a high quality and consistent customer experience regardless of sales channel if our technology systems do not meet customer expectations or if we are unable to attract retain and manage the personnel at various levels who have the necessary skills and experience we need to implement our omnichannel initiatives 

  

our business is dependent upon capital to fund growth and to support the activities of our caf   segment changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our   business sales results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support the expansion of our store base and sales growth in existing stores could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth although in recent years internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to fund our growth there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows sufficient to fund our growth failure to do so—or our decision to put our cash to other uses—would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our growth 

changes in the availability or cost of the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loan receivables through caf could adversely affect sales and results of operations we use a securitization program to fund the majority of the auto loan receivables originated by caf changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our revolving credit facility term loan senior unsecured notes and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions—especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows—could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our   more than 25000 associates 

  

our associates are the driving force behind our success we believe that one of the things that sets carmax apart is a culture centered on valuing all associates in addition our strategic initiatives require management employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities our failure to maintain this culture or to continue recruiting developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates our growth plans changes in employment legislation and competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and for service technicians in particular our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is also subject to our ability to maintain positive associate relations if we are unable to do so or if despite our efforts we become subject to successful unionization efforts it could increase costs limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our success also depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers a breach of this confidentiality whether due to a cybersecurity or other incident could result in harm to our customers and damage to our brand 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers this information includes the information customers provide when purchasing a vehicle and applying for vehicle financing we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential associate information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers although we have taken measures designed to safeguard such information and have received assurances from our thirdparty providers our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty providers could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events numerous national retailers have disclosed security breaches involving sophisticated cyberattacks that were not recognized or detected until after such retailers had been affected notwithstanding the preventive measures such retailers had in place any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or associate information whether experienced by us or by our thirdparty service providers and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident a programming error or other cause could damage our reputation expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement 

disrupt our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to such a security breach could exacerbate the consequences of the breach 

our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles 

any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for example if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap in addition any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins 

we may experience greater credit losses in caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables than anticipated 

we are exposed to the risk that our customers who finance their purchases through caf will be unable or unwilling to repay their loans according to their terms and that the vehicle collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to ensure full repayment credit losses are inherent in caf’s business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we make various assumptions and judgments about caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors although management will establish an allowance for loan losses it believes is appropriate this allowance may not be adequate for example if economic conditions were to deteriorate unexpectedly additional loan losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses may occur losses in excess of the existing allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory obstacles to acquiring inventory—whether because of supply competition or other factors—or a failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations although the supply of latemodel used vehicles has been increasing there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that it will benefit carmax 

we source a significant percentage of our vehicles though our appraisal process and these vehicles are generally more profitable for carmax accordingly if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or fail to recognize those trends it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory it could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from thirdparty auctions which is generally less profitable for carmax our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition both from new and used car dealers directly and through third parties driving appraisal traffic to those dealers see the risk factor above titled “ we operate in a highly competitive   industry ” for discussion of this risk our ability to source vehicles from thirdparty auctions could be affected by an increase in the number of closed auctions that are open only to new car dealers who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers 

used vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk accordingly if we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

we rely on thirdparty finance providers to finance a significant portion of our customers’ vehicle purchases accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties 

we provide financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty finance providers if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide financing to our customers provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers to supply epp products to our customers accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these thirdparties 

we receive revenue for selling epp products on behalf of unrelated thirdparties who are the primary obligors the third parties that provide esps are assurant inc cna national warranty corporation and fidelity warranty services inc the third party 

that provides gap products is safeguard products international llc if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide epp products make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations changes in these laws and regulations or our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations our sale of used vehicles is subject to state and local licensing requirements federal and state laws regulating vehicle advertising and state laws regulating vehicle sales and service our provision of vehicle financing is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies and large employers generally including privacy laws and federal employment practices securities and tax laws for additional discussion of these laws and regulations see the section of this form 10k titled “ business –  laws and regulations ” 

the violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against our business operations any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations 

changes in federal labor policy could lead to increased unionization efforts which could increase labor costs disrupt store operations and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities continue to scrutinize advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced see the risk factor titled “ we operate in a highly competitive   industry ” for discussion of this risk 

our failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business sales   and results of operations 

our growth is dependent both on opening stores in new and existing markets and continued sales growth in our existing stores the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our information systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our new store growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations sales growth in our existing stores requires that we continue to effectively execute our business strategies and implement new and ongoing initiatives to elevate the experience of our customers see the risk factor above titled “ our failure to realize the benefits associated with our omnichannel initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations ” for more discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base and implementation of new initiatives also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion see the risk factor above titled “ our success depends upon the   continued contributions of our more than   25000   associates ” for discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base also requires real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are forced to curtail or stop new store growth or the implementation of our customer experience initiatives it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated information systems to run our business the failure of these systems or the inability to enhance our capabilities   could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to manage sales inventory our customerfacing websites and applications carmaxcom carmax mobile apps and carmaxauctionscom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary or the inability to enhance our information technology capabilities could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

in addition despite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems we could be subjected to attacks by hackers including denialofservice attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations see the risk factor above titled “ we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers ” for the risks associated with a breach of confidential customer or associate information 

we are subject to various legal proceedings if the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to carmax it could   have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various litigation matters from time to time which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these claims could be asserted under a variety of laws including but not limited to consumer finance laws consumer protection laws intellectual property laws privacy laws labor and employment laws securities laws and employee benefit laws these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers including manufacturer recalls 

adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles including the supply of latemodel used vehicles in addition manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years because we do not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs some vehicles we sell may have unrepaired safety recalls such recalls and our lack of authorization to make recallrelated repairs could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates as well as changes in accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of carmax’s assets liabilities revenues expenses and earnings if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data 

the implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile and could expose us to securities class action litigation 

the price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations based upon our operating results general economic and market conditions general trends and prospects for our industry announcements by our competitors and other factors in addition the market price of our common stock may also be affected by whether we meet analysts’ expectations failure to meet such expectations could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation may be initiated if similar litigation were instituted against us it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our attention and resources which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we rely on thirdparty vendors for key components of our business 

many components of our business including data management key operational processes and critical customer systems are provided by third parties we carefully select our thirdparty vendors but we do not control their actions if our vendors fail to perform as we expect our operations and reputation could suffer if the failure harms the vendors’ ability to serve us and our customers the use of thirdparty vendors represents an unavoidable inherent risk to our company that could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 

we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

our business is sensitive to weather events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain hail snow wind storms hurricanes extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

we are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated 

our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us california texas and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations

none 




 item 2 properties 

we conduct our retail vehicle operations primarily in two formats – production and nonproduction stores production stores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production stores have more service bays and require additional space for reconditioning activities and therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction store on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some stores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction stores until we expand our presence in that market we also have production and nonproduction stores that operate in metropolitan statistical areas “msas” of less than 600000 people which we define as small markets some of these stores also have a smaller footprint compared with our stores in larger markets 

u sed  c ar  s tores b y  f ormat as of  f ebruary 28 2019

expansion 

since opening our first used car store in 1993 we have grown organically through the construction and opening of companyoperated stores we do not franchise our operations as of february 28 2019  we operated in 100  us television markets which covered approximately 76  of the us population we believe that both further expansion of our store base and increases in market share in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth we currently plan to open 13  stores in fiscal 2020  and a similar number of stores in fiscal 2021

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation all references to net earnings per share are to diluted net earnings per share amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding 

overview 

see part i item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company’s business 

  

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations 

our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services such as wholesale vehicle sales the sale of extended protection plan “epp” products which include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” and vehicle repair service we offer competitive nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles valueadded epp products and superior customer service our website and related mobile apps are tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to shop online 

our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us and availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the sales process we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with industryleading thirdparty finance providers all of the finance offers whether by caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option 

as of february 28 2019  we operated 203  used car stores in 100  us television markets as of that date we also conducted wholesale auctions at 76  used car stores and we operated 2  new car franchises 

carmax auto finance 

in addition to thirdparty finance providers we provide vehicle financing through caf which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option as a result we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 432  of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2019  as of february 28 2019  caf serviced approximately 966000  customer accounts in its 1251 billion  portfolio of managed receivables 

management regularly analyzes caf’s operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer profitability the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses 

revenues and profitability 

our primary sources of revenue and gross profit from carmax sales operations for fiscal 2019  are as follows 



a highlevel summary of our financial results from fiscal 2019  compared with fiscal 2018  is as follows 



changes in net earnings were impacted by the following 

 

refer to “results of operations”  for further details on our revenues and profitability 

liquidity 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from nonrecourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources during fiscal 2019  net cash provided by operations totaled 1630 million  this amount combined with 8908 million  of net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable 

resulted in 105 billion  of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities a nongaap measure this liquidity together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility was primarily used to fund the 136 million  common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program our store growth and strategic initiatives 

when considering cash provided by operating activities management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been funded with nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities for a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to net cash provided by used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure see “reconciliation of adjusted net cash from operating activities” included in “financial condition – liquidity and capital resources” 

future outlook 

our longterm strategy is to complete the rollout of our retail concept including our new omnichannel experience and to increase our share of used vehicle unit sales in each of the markets in which we operate our new omnichannel experience empowers customers to buy a car on their own terms either completely from home instore or through a seamlessly integrated combination of online and instore experiences we believe that over the long term used vehicle unit sales are the primary driver for earnings growth we also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and over time increased caf income 

in calendar 2018 we estimate we sold approximately 44  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate and approximately 33  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold on a nationwide basis our strategy to increase our market share includes continuing to focus on 

 

in order to execute our longterm strategy we are investing in various strategic initiatives to increase innovation specifically with regards to customer facing and customerenabling technologies we continue to make improvements to our website and introduce new customer experiences such as finance preapproval home delivery online appraisal and express pickup we are also developing and implementing tools that help our associates be more efficient and effective additionally we are centralizing customer support in our customer experience centers which we expect to provide a more seamless integration between the online and instore experience for our customers our use of data is a core component of these initiatives and continues to be a strategic asset for us as we leverage data to enhance the customer experience and increase operational efficiencies in december 2018 we launched our new omnichannel car buying experience in the atlanta market which will help us learn how to best operationalize all our offerings and scale them across the entire organization we anticipate having the new omnichannel experience available to the majority of our customers by the end of fiscal 2020 

while there are incremental costs and inefficiencies in the near term related to strategic initiatives we have also identified potential cost savings through process changes and other improvements that can help offset these expenses over time while in any individual period conditions may vary over the long term we would expect to begin leveraging our sga expenses when comparable store used unit sales growth is in the midsingle digit range with increased spending expected for fiscal 2020 we believe our comparable store used unit sales growth will need to be in the range of 5 to 8 to leverage sga we expect the rate of growth in spending on these initiatives to slow in fiscal 2021 and taper thereafter we will continue to look for opportunities to reduce waste and reprioritize spend 

as of february 28 2019  we had used car stores located in 100  television markets which covered approximately 76  of the us population the format and operating models utilized in stores are continuously evaluated and may evolve over time based upon market and consumer expectations we opened 15  stores in fiscal 2019  and plan to open 13  stores in fiscal 2020  and a similar number of stores in fiscal 2021  for a detailed list of stores we plan to open in fiscal 2020  see the table included in “planned future activities” 

while we execute our longterm strategy there are trends and factors that could impact our strategic approach or our results in the short and medium term a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory is sourced from local regional and online wholesale auto auctions wholesale vehicle prices are influenced by a variety of factors including the supply of vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 1 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving funding program composed of three warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf we typically elect to fund these receivables through an assetbacked term funding transaction such as a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement at a later date we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions including term securitizations together “nonrecourse funding vehicles” as secured borrowings which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses 

see notes 1f 1h and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loan receivables 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date such losses are expected to become evident during the following 12 months because net loss performance can vary substantially over time estimating net losses requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain 

the allowance for loan losses is estimated using a combination of analytical models and management judgment these models are primarily based on the composition of the portfolio of managed receivables including month of origination and actual prior performance of the receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves for receivables that have less than 12 months of performance history the estimate also takes into account the credit grades of the receivables and historical losses by credit grade to supplement actual loss data in estimating future performance once the receivables have 12 months of performance history the estimate reflects actual loss experience of those receivables to date along with forward loss curves to predict future performance the forward loss curves are constructed using historical performance data and show the average timing of losses over the course of a receivable’s life 

estimates from these models rely on historical performance information and may not fully reflect losses inherent in the present portfolio therefore management also considers recent trends in delinquencies and defaults recovery rates and the economic environment in assessing the models used in estimating the allowance for loan losses and may adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect factors that may not be captured in the models in addition management periodically considers whether the use of additional metrics would result in improved model performance and revises the models when appropriate 

determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses requires management to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain including the timing and distribution of net losses that could materially affect the allowance for loan losses and therefore net earnings to the extent that actual performance differs from our estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce net earnings a 10 change in the estimated loss rates would have changed the allowance for loan losses by approximately 138 million  as of february 28 2019  

see notes 1h and 4 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 7‑day moneyback guarantee we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors to customers who purchase a retail vehicle the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their retail installment contract we recognize revenue on a net basis at the time of sale we also record a reserve for estimated contract cancellations the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience recent trends and credit mix of the customer base our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of epp sales customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates a 10 change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately 103 million as of february 28 2019  see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves 

we are contractually entitled to receive profitsharing revenues based on the performance of the esps administered by third parties these revenues are a form of variable consideration included in the esp transaction price to the extent that it is probable that it will not result in a significant revenue reversal an estimate of the amount to which we expect to be entitled subject to various constraints is recognized upon satisfying the performance obligation of selling the esp these constraints include factors that are outside of the company’s influence or control and the length of time until settlement we apply the expected value method utilizing historical claims and cancellation data from carmax customers as well as other qualitative assumptions this estimate is reassessed each reporting period with changes reflected in other sales and revenues on our consolidated statements of earnings and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets profitsharing payments by the esp provider begin when the underlying esps reach a specified level of claims history 

customers applying for financing who are not approved or are conditionally approved by caf are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we recognize these fees at the time of sale 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2019  versus fiscal 2018    the 54  increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2019  was primarily due to a 38  increase in unit sales the increase in used unit sales included a 03  increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by improved conversion partially offset by lower store traffic website traffic grew 16 we believe that the solid performance of our store teams and the impacts of our digital initiatives contributed to our continued improvements in conversion in both fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2018  we believe our comparable store used unit sales growth was adversely affected by delays in february tax refunds relative to last year the continuation of higher acquisition prices and a robust competitive environment our data indicates that our share of the age 0 to 10year old used vehicles in our current comparable store markets fell from approximately 45 to 44 in calendar 2018 

the increase in average retail selling price reflected the net effects of higher vehicle acquisition costs and shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class we believe vehicle acquisition costs remained high throughout fiscal 2019 as the industry continued to experience a lower than normal depreciation environment 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    the 85  increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018  was primarily due to a 75  increase in unit sales the increase in used unit sales included a 20  increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by continued strong conversion partially offset by lower store traffic 

average retail selling price for fiscal 2018  remained relatively consistent with the prior year reflecting the net effects of shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class and lower vehicle acquisition costs decreases in vehicle acquisition costs in the first half of the year were largely offset by increases in the second half of the year we believe lower seasonal depreciation was a significant driver of the increase in vehicle acquisition costs in the second half of the year at the same time industry new vehicle transaction prices benefited from aggressive new car incentives we believe the resulting change in the relative affordability of new vehicles versus latemodel vehicles was one of the factors contributing to our comparable store used unit sales performance 

wholesale vehicle sales 

vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are on average approximately 10 years old with more than 100000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold 

fiscal 2019  versus fiscal 2018    the 97  increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2019  resulted from a 95  increase in wholesale unit sales the wholesale unit growth was primarily driven by growth in our store base an increase in our appraisal buy rate and an increase in comparable store appraisal traffic we believe the appraisal buy rate and comparable store appraisal traffic benefited from strong wholesale industry vehicle valuations which allowed us to provide seasonally strong appraisal offers for both fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 wholesale vehicle average selling price for fiscal 2019  remained consistent with the prior year 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    the 47  increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018  resulted from a 43  increase in wholesale unit sales during fiscal 2018  increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to an increase in our appraisal buy rate and the growth in our store base were partially offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic wholesale vehicle average selling price for fiscal 2018  remained consistent with the prior year 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of esps and gap collectively reported in epp revenues net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are predominantly comprised of service department and new vehicle sales the fees we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers the mix of our retail vehicles financed by caf tier 2 and tier 3 providers or customers that arrange their own financing may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants changes in providers’ credit decisioning and external market conditions changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers 

fiscal 2019  versus fiscal 2018    other sales and revenues increased 111  in fiscal 2019  epp revenues increased 137  compared with the prior year reflecting cost decreases from plan providers the increase in our retail unit volume and 84 million  in esp profit sharing revenues associated with our adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard in fiscal 2019 see note 2 for additional information on revenue related to esps the 65 million  reduction in net thirdparty finance fees reflected shifts in our sales mix by finance channel including an increase in our tier 2 and a decrease in our tier 3 sales 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    other sales and revenues increased 47  in fiscal 2018  epp revenues increased 101  compared with the prior year largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales the 115 million  reduction in net thirdparty finance fees reflected shifts in our sales mix by finance channel including a decline in our tier 2 and an increase in our tier 3 sales

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit 

we systematically adjust individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include the wholesale and retail vehicle pricing environments vehicle reconditioning and logistics costs and the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels 

fiscal 2019  versus fiscal 2018    the 39  increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2019  was primarily driven by the 38  growth in total used unit sales our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2018  we believe we can manage to a targeted gross profit per unit dollar range subject to future changes to our business or pricing strategy 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    the 80  increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018  was primarily driven by the 75  growth in total used unit sales our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2017  

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit 

fiscal 2019  versus fiscal 2018    the 98  increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2019  was driven by the 95  increase in wholesale unit sales our wholesale gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2018  we believe our wholesale gross profit per unit continued to benefit from a lower depreciation environment relative to historical trends 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    the 82  increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018  was driven by the 43  increase in wholesale unit sales and a 35  or 38  increase in wholesale gross profit per unit we believe our wholesale gross profit per unit benefited from a lower depreciation environment relative to historical trends 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are predominantly comprised of service department operations including used vehicle reconditioning and new vehicle sales we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent revenues paid to us by certain thirdparty providers thirdparty finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to thirdparty tier 3 finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

fiscal 2019  versus fiscal 2018    other gross profit rose 141  in fiscal 2019  primarily reflecting the improvement in epp revenues and net thirdparty finance fees discussed above 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    other gross profit remained consistent in fiscal 2018  as a 192 million  decrease in service profits and the decrease in net thirdparty finance fees discussed above were largely offset by the noted increase in epp revenues service profits were affected by the reduced leverage of service department costs resulting from our more modest comparable store used unit growth in the latter half of fiscal 2018  

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not had a significant impact on results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices however we believe higher vehicle acquisition prices partially driven by lower seasonal vehicle depreciation affected comparable store used unit sales growth and therefore our results of operations in fiscal 2018 and 2019 additionally changes in average vehicle selling prices impact caf income to the extent the average amount financed also changes

interest expense 

interest expense includes the interest related to short and longterm debt and financing and capital lease obligations it does not include interest on the nonrecourse notes payable which is reflected within caf income 

fiscal 2019  versus fiscal 2018    interest expense increased to 758 million  in fiscal 2019  versus 707 million  in fiscal 2018  the increase primarily reflected higher interest rates on outstanding debt in fiscal 2019  

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    interest expense increased to 707 million  in fiscal 2018  versus 564 million  in fiscal 2017  the increase reflected the combined effects of higher outstanding debt levels and interest rates in fiscal 2018  as well as a reduction in capitalized interest 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 243  in fiscal 2019  376  in fiscal 2018  and 377  in fiscal 2017  the decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2019  is primarily due to the reduction in the federal statutory tax rate following the enactment of the 2017 tax act 

the fiscal 2018 effective income tax rate included the effect of an 119 million net increase in tax expense resulting from the enactment of the 2017 tax act including 

 

results of operations – carmax auto finance 

caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses total interest margin reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time continued increases in interest rates which affect caf’s funding costs or other competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations changes in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables reflect the effect of the change in loss and delinquency experience on our outlook for net losses expected to occur over the next 12 months 

caf’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multiyear period we strive to originate loans with an underlying risk profile that we believe will in the aggregate and excluding caf’s tier 3 originations result in cumulative net losses in the 2 to 25 range over the life of the loans actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations economic conditions and wholesale recovery rates current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business including the volume of loans originated current interest rates charged to consumers loan terms and average credit scores because we recognize caf income over the life of the underlying auto loan loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period’s financial results 

caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses

tier 3 loan originations   caf also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers in order to better understand the performance of these loans mitigate risk and add incremental profits caf currently targets originating approximately 5 of the total tier 3 loan volume however this rate may vary over time based on market conditions a total of 1624 million  and 1475 million  in caf tier 3 receivables were outstanding as of february 28 2019  and 2018  respectively these loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the caf portfolio as well as higher contract rates as of february 28 2019  and 2018  approximately 10 of the total allowance for loan losses related to the outstanding caf tier 3 loan balances 

planned future activities 

  

we currently plan to open 13  stores in fiscal 2020  and a similar number of stores in fiscal 2021  in fiscal 2020  we will be entering six new television markets and expanding our presence in seven existing television markets of the 13  stores we plan to open in fiscal 2020  6 are in metropolitan statistical areas “msas” having populations of 600000 or less which we define as small markets we currently estimate capital expenditures will total   approximately   350 million   in fiscal 2020

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations store expansion   and improvement and caf since fiscal 2013 we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from nonrecourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility   or through other financing sources 

we currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35 to 45 in calculating this ratio we utilize total debt excluding nonrecourse notes payable a multiple of 8 times rent expense and total shareholders’ equity we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources together with stock repurchases to maintain this targeted ratio however in any period we may be outside this range due to seasonal market strategic or other factors 

  

operating activities  during fiscal 2019  net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1630 million  compared with net cash used in operating activities of 806 million  in fiscal 2018  and 4553 million  in fiscal 2017  which included increases in auto loan receivables of 105 billion  in fiscal 2019  108 billion  in fiscal 2018  and 121 billion  in fiscal 2017  the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities 

  

as of february 28 2019  total inventory was 252 billion  representing an increase of 1288 million  or 54  compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year the increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2019  as well as the ongoing optimization of inventory across stores 

as of february 28 2018  total inventory was 239 billion  representing an increase of 1301 million  or   58 compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year   the increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2018  as well as an increase in acquisition costs resulting from higher wholesale valuations especially in the months following hurricanes harvey and irma 

when considering cash provided by operating activities management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in nonrecourse notes payable this is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were funded through the issuance of nonrecourse notes payable during the year the resulting financial measure adjusted net cash from operating activities is a nongaap financial measure we believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations including the increases in nonrecourse notes payable net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows

compared with fiscal 2018  the increase in fiscal 2019  adjusted net cash provided by operating activities reflected the increase in net earnings when excluding noncash expenses which include depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation expense the provisions for loan losses and cancellation reserves and the deferred income tax provision as well as an increase in cash provided by working capital 

compared with fiscal 2017  the increase in fiscal 2018  adjusted net cash provided by operating activities reflected the change in inventory during fiscal 2018  and the increase in net earnings when excluding noncash expenses these increases were partially offset by the timing and use of nonrecourse funding vehicles in relation to originations of auto loan receivables 

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities totaled 3085 million  in fiscal 2019  3019 million  in fiscal 2018  and 4200 million  in fiscal 2017  investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled   3046 million  in fiscal 2019    2968 million  in fiscal 2018  and   4181 million  in fiscal 2017     capital expenditures primarily include store construction costs real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store remodeling expenses we maintain a multiyear pipeline of sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years   we opened 15  stores in each of fiscal 2019  fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  

  

financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities totaled 1860 million  in fiscal 2019  4134 million  in fiscal 2018  and 9219 million  in fiscal 2017  included in these amounts were net increases in total nonrecourse notes payable of   8908 million  9022 million  and 121 billion  respectively which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of 105 billion  108 billion  and 121 billion  respectively in auto loan receivables see operating activities during fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2018  we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by 1689 million  and 426 million  respectively during fiscal 2017  we sold 500 million  of senior unsecured notes in a private placement and used a portion of the proceeds to reduce net borrowings under our revolving credit facility net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of   9047 million  in fiscal 2019  5796 million  in fiscal 2018   and 5643 million   in fiscal 2017  

t otal d ebt and c ash and c ash e quivalents 

 

borrowings under our 120 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us the credit facility term loan and senior note agreements contain representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements were not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity 

see note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility term loan senior notes and financing and capital lease obligations 

caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through our warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions these nonrecourse funding vehicles are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our nonrecourse funding vehicles even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the related receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these nonrecourse funding vehicles 

as of february 28 2019  1066 billion  and 188 billion  of nonrecourse notes payable were outstanding related to assetbacked term funding transactions and our warehouse facilities respectively during fiscal 2019  we funded a total of 576 billion  in assetbacked term funding transactions 

we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time as our store base sales and caf loan originations have grown see notes 1f and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

the agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to fund receivables through the warehouse facilities we generally repurchase the receivables funded through these warehouse facilities when we enter into an assetbacked term funding transaction if our counterparties were to refuse to permit these repurchases it could impact our ability to execute on our funding program in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the related receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

we expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations borrowings under existing new or expanded credit facilities and other funding arrangements will be sufficient to fund caf capital expenditures repurchases of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements 

the timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on share price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock as of february 28 2019  a total of 275 billion  of board authorizations for repurchases were outstanding with no expiration date at that date 211 billion  remained available for repurchase see note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure  nonrecourse notes payable 

as of february 28 2019  and 2018  all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved primarily through nonrecourse funding vehicles that in turn issued both fixed and variablerate notes nonrecourse funding vehicles include warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions 

borrowings under our warehouse facilities are variablerate debt and are secured by auto loan receivables the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through an assetbacked term funding transaction which issue notes payable that accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates 

interest rate risk related to variablerate debt is primarily mitigated by entering into derivative instruments our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables disruptions in the credit markets or unexpected changes in prepayment activity could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

absent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk a 100basis point increase in market interest rates associated with nonrecourse funding vehicles would have decreased our fiscal 2019  net earnings per share by approximately 009  

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities

interest rate exposure  other debt 

we have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our term loan however a portion of the variablerate risk is mitigated by a derivative instrument substantially all of these borrowings are variablerate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2019  net earnings per share by approximately 001  

other market exposures 

our pension plan has interest rate risk related to its projected benefit obligation “pbo” due to the relatively young overall age of the plan’s participants a 100basis point change in the discount rate has approximately a 20  effect on the pbo balance a 100basis point decrease in the discount rate would have decreased our fiscal 2019  net earnings per share by less than 001  see note 10 for more information on our benefit plans 

  

as our cashsettled restricted stock units are liability awards the related compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the company’s stock price the marktomarket effect on the liability depends on each award’s grant price and previously recognized expense at february 28 2019  a 100 change in the company’s stock price would have affected fiscal 2019  net earnings per share by less than 001

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background 

carmax inc delivers an unrivaled customer experience by offering a broad selection of quality used vehicles and related products and services at low nohaggle prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility as well as through carmaxcom and our mobile apps by focusing on customer service associate development and efficient execution we are the nation’s largest retailer of used cars selling 721512  used vehicles at retail during the fiscal year ended february 28 2018  in addition we are one of the nation’s largest operators of wholesale vehicle auctions and one of the nation’s largest providers of used vehicle financing 

carmax was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax store in richmond virginia on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company as of february 28 2018  we operated 188  used car stores in 91  us television markets our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

carmax business 

we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations   our carmax sales operations segment sells used vehicles purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources sells related products and services and arranges financing options for customers all for fixed nohaggle prices we enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer 

purchasing a vehicle  

the vehicle purchase process in a carmax store differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience our nohaggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers in addition our sales consultants are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate this pay structure aligns our sales associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

we recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our carmax quality certified standards and each vehicle must pass an inspection before being offered for sale we stand behind every used vehicle we sell with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty our carmax quality certified standards were developed internally by carmax and are not affiliated with any third party or original equipment manufacturer program 

we maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory of approximately 70000  vehicles as of february 28 2018  available for viewing on carmaxcom as well as our mobile apps upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in this inventory to a local store this allows a single carmax store to offer access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer in fiscal 2018  approximately 30   of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request 

in addition to retailing used vehicles we sell new vehicles at two  locations under franchise agreements 

selling us a vehicle  

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a customer’s vehicle free of charge and make a written guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us this nohaggle offer is good for seven days 

based on age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through our instore appraisal process meet our retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers as of february 28 2018  we conducted wholesale auctions at 73  of our 188  stores during fiscal 2018  we sold 408509  wholesale vehicles through these onsite auctions with an average auction sales rate of approximately 95  

financing a vehicle  

the availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process and having an array of finance sources increases approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax our finance program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both caf and thirdparty providers we believe that our processes and systems transparency of pricing and vehicle quality as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit allow caf and our thirdparty providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment all finance offers whether from caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge 

related products and services  

we provide customers with a range of other related products and services including extended protection plan “epp” products and vehicle repair service epp products include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” which is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business in fiscal 2018  approximately 60  of the customers who purchased a retail used vehicle also purchased an esp and approximately 20  purchased gap 

carmax auto finance   caf provides financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history and other credit data of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely through carmax stores our scoring models are optimized for the carmax channel we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 431  of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2018  

caf also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements collecting payments maintaining contact with delinquent customers and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans as of february 28 2018  caf serviced approximately 895000  customer accounts in its 1162 billion  portfolio of managed receivables 

competition 

carmax sales operations   the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and we face competition from franchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles independent used car dealers online and mobile sales platforms and private parties according to industry sources as of december 31 2017  there were approximately 18000  franchised dealers in the us who we consider to be our primary retail competitors as they sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles competition in our industry is increasingly affected by the use of webbased marketing and other webbased tools for both consumers and the dealers with whom we compete 

based on industry data there were approximately 40 million  used cars sold in the us in calendar 2017  of which approximately 22 million  were estimated to be 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us in calendar 2017  we estimate we sold approximately 46  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the television markets in which we operate an increase of almost 7 over calendar 2016 our market share is generally the highest in markets in which we have been established for many years entering new markets could have a dampening effect on our market share given that our initial market share in new markets is generally much lower than our average on a nationwide basis we estimate we sold approximately 3  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in calendar year 2017  

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our low nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on site and via carmaxcom and our mobile apps the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems the transparency and availability of caf and thirdparty financing the locations of our retail stores and our commitment to evolving our carbuying experience to meet customers’ changing expectations in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer 

is buying a car from us provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our high volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards 

our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast to the highly fragmented used vehicle retail market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc which together represent an estimated 70  of the north american wholesale car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax’s auctions predominantly sell older higher mileage vehicles 

carmax auto finance   caf operates and is a significant participant in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies according to industry sources this sector represented more than 1 trillion  in outstanding receivables as of december 31 2017  caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars 

we believe that caf’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source in carmax stores and that caf’s primary driver for growth is the growth in carmax’s retail used unit sales we periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness we also monitor 3day payoffs as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our offer 

products and services 

retail merchandising   we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including domestic imported and luxury vehicles at competitive prices our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old these vehicles generally range in price from 11000 to 35000 the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences seasonality and market availability 

wholesale auctions   the typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase our auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis 

  

extended protection plans   at the time of sale we offer customers epp products we receive revenue for selling these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors we have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements the esps we currently offer on all used retail vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract the epps that we sell other than manufacturer programs on new car sales have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements periodically we may receive retrospective commissions based upon the performance of the policies administered by the third parties 

reconditioning and service   an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our internal standards before it can become a carmax quality certified vehicle this process includes an inspection of the engine and all major systems based on this inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our internal quality standards many of our stores depend upon nearby typically larger carmax stores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services including but not limited to services related to manufacturer’s warranties we engage third parties specializing in those services carmax does not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs and some vehicles carmax sells may have unrepaired safety recalls however we review any unrepaired safety recall information as reported by the national highway traffic safety administration with our used vehicle customers before purchase 

in addition all carmax used car stores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by the esps we sell 

customer credit   we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and arrangements with several financial institutions vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicle as of february 28 2018  our thirdparty finance providers included ally financial american credit acceptance capital one auto finance chase auto finance exeter finance corp santander consumer usa wells fargo dealer services and westlake financial services we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged and held by thirdparty providers and we periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

generally credit applications submitted by customers to carmax are initially reviewed by caf using our proprietary underwriting standards based on that review caf makes financing offers designed to create a loan portfolio that meets our targeted risk profile in the aggregate applications that caf declines or approves with conditions are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers thirdparty providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we refer to the providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as tier 3 providers we are willing to pay a fee to tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that they may not otherwise be able to obtain all fees either received or paid are prenegotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount financed the interest rate the term of the loan or the loantovalue ratio caf also provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a tier 3 provider 

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

suppliers for used vehicles 

we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process as well as through local regional and online auctions while in any individual period conditions may vary over the past 10 fiscal years 38 to 52 of our retail inventory has been acquired through our appraisal process annually we also to a lesser extent acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market 

the supply of latemodel used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the volume of new vehicle sales which in turn generate used car tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry sources there were approximately 270 million  light vehicles in operation in the us as of december 31 2017  during calendar year 2017  it is estimated that approximately 17 million  new cars and 40 million  used cars were sold at retail many of which were accompanied by tradeins and approximately 20 million  wholesale vehicles were sold at auctions and through other nontraditional channels 

based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year consumer acceptance of our instore appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

seasonality 

historically our business has been seasonal our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter we typically experience an increase in traffic and sales in february and march coinciding with federal income tax refund season 

systems 

our business is supported by proprietary digital and mobile technologies that provide enhanced customer experience while enabling highly integrated automation of all operating functions including credit processing and supply chain management buyers and sales consultants are equipped with mobile and centralized tools that allow them to access realtime information to better serve our customers our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity 

our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location leveraging our more than twenty years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles our system generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that take into account factors that include sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

marketing and advertising 

our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmaxcom and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle these strategies are implemented through a broad range of media types our website and related mobile apps are marketing tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct 

part of the shopping and sales process online our website and mobile apps also include a variety of other customer service features including the ability to initiate vehicle transfers schedule appointments and apply for financing preapproval information on the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated several times per day our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2018  approximately 90  of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online 

associates 

on february 28 2018  we had a total of 25110  full and parttime associates including 18637  hourly and salaried associates and 6473  sales associates who predominantly worked on a commission basis we employ additional associates during peak selling seasons we believe we have created a unique corporate culture and maintain good employee relations no associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement we focus on developing our associates and providing them with the information and resources they need to offer exceptional customer service and have been recognized for the success of our efforts by a number of external organizations 

intellectual property 

our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy our principal trademarks including carmax and the related family of marks have been registered with the us patent and trademark office

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business sales results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

we operate in a highly competitive   industry failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation’s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of the internet to market buy sell and finance used vehicles could adversely affect   our business sales and results of operations 

  

automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers and online and mobile sales platforms as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices new car dealers in particular including publicly traded auto retailers have increased their sales of used vehicles in recent years these new car dealers also leverage their franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers to brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax 

retail competition   some of our competitors have announced plans for rapid expansion including into markets with carmax locations and some of them have begun to execute those plans some of our competitors have also replicated or attempted to replicate portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car store in 1993 including our use of low nohaggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer’s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us if we fail to respond effectively to our retail competitors it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

online sales and facilitation   the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles and to provide vehicle financing could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations emerging competitors using online focused business models both for direct sales and consumertoconsumer facilitation could materially impact our current business model the online availability of used vehicle information including pricing information could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines and online classified sites that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmaxcom to attract traffic these companies could also make it more difficult for carmax to otherwise market its vehicles online 

the increasing use of the internet to facilitate consumers’ sales or tradeins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations for example certain websites provide online appraisal tools to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than carmax 

in addition to the direct competition and increasing use of the internet described above there are companies that sell software and data solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to among other things more efficiently source and price inventory although these companies do not compete with carmax the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with carmax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of carmax’s internally developed proprietary systems 

if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures or to changes in the used vehicle marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

caf competition   our caf segment is subject to competition from various financial institutions including banks and credit unions which provide vehicle financing to consumers if we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our thirdparty finance providers which are generally less profitable to carmax or through other outside financing sources moreover if caf competitors are able to attract potential customers before they visit carmax whether through competitive finance offers or ease of customer experience they may be directed to retail options other than carmax accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance offers to our customers or our finance competitors are able to successfully attract and redirect a disproportionate number of our potential customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

evolving marketplace   the marketplace for used vehicles may be impacted by the significant and likely accelerating changes to the broader automotive industry technological changes including the development of autonomous vehicles new products 

and services new business models and new methods of travel could reduce automotive retail demand or disrupt our current business model if we fail to respond effectively to the evolving marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

carmax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our   business sales and results of operations 

our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and could involve among other things our sales process our provision of financing our reconditioning process or our treatment of customers even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results 

the use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected we monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns provide accurate information and protect our reputation but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions these conditions could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to national and regional us economic conditions these conditions include but are not limited to recession inflation interest rates unemployment levels the state of the housing market gasoline prices consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general these conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as acts of terrorism when these economic conditions worsen or stagnate it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally on demand from particular consumer categories or demand for particular vehicle types it can also negatively impact availability of credit to finance vehicle purchases for all or certain categories of consumers this could result in lower sales decreased margins on units sold and decreased profits for our caf segment worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of latemodel used vehicles as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time this could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold 

  

any significant change or deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business is dependent upon capital to fund growth and to support the activities of our caf   segment changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our   business sales results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support the expansion of our store base and sales growth in existing stores could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth although in recent years internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to fund our growth there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows sufficient to fund our growth failure to do so—or our decision to put our cash to other uses—would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our growth 

changes in the availability or cost of the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loan receivables through caf could adversely affect sales and results of operations we use a securitization program to fund the majority of the auto loan receivables originated by caf changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our revolving credit facility term loan senior unsecured notes and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions—especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows—could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our   more than 25000 associates 

  

our associates are the driving force behind our success we believe that one of the things that sets carmax apart is a culture centered on valuing all associates in addition our strategic initiatives require management employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities our failure to maintain this culture or to continue recruiting developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates our growth plans changes in employment legislation and competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and for qualified service technicians in particular our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is also subject to our ability to maintain positive associate relations if we are unable to do so or if despite our efforts we become subject to successful unionization efforts it could increase costs limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our success also depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers a breach of this confidentiality whether due to a cybersecurity or other incident could result in harm to our customers and damage to our brand 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers this information includes the information customers provide when purchasing a vehicle and applying for vehicle financing we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential associate information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers although we have taken measures designed to safeguard such information and have received assurances from our thirdparty providers our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty providers could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events numerous national retailers have disclosed security breaches involving sophisticated cyberattacks that were not recognized or detected until after such retailers had been affected notwithstanding the preventive measures such retailers had in place any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or associate information whether experienced by us or by our thirdparty service providers and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident a programming error or other cause could damage our reputation expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement disrupt our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to such a security breach could exacerbate the consequences of the breach 

our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles 

any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for example if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap in addition any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins 

we may experience greater credit losses in caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables than anticipated 

we are exposed to the risk that our customers who finance their purchases through caf will be unable or unwilling to repay their loans according to their terms and that the vehicle collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to ensure full repayment credit losses are inherent in caf’s business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we make various assumptions and judgments about caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors although management will establish an allowance for loan losses it believes is appropriate this allowance may not be adequate for example if economic conditions were to deteriorate unexpectedly additional loan losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses may occur losses in excess of the existing allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory obstacles to acquiring inventory—whether because of supply competition or other factors—or a failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations although the supply of latemodel used vehicles has been increasing there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that it will benefit carmax 

we source a significant percentage of our vehicles though our appraisal process and these vehicles are generally more profitable for carmax accordingly if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or fail to recognize those trends it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory it could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from thirdparty auctions which is generally less profitable for carmax our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition both from new and used car dealers directly and through thirdparty websites driving appraisal traffic to those dealers see the risk factor above titled “ we operate in a highly competitive   industry ” for discussion of this risk our ability to source vehicles from thirdparty auctions could be affected by an increase in the number of closed auctions that are open only to new car dealers who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers 

used vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk accordingly if we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

we rely on thirdparty finance providers to finance a significant portion of our customers’ vehicle purchases accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties 

we provide financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty finance providers if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide financing to our customers provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers to supply epp products to our customers accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these thirdparties 

we receive revenue for selling epp products on behalf of unrelated thirdparties who are the primary obligors the third parties that provide esps are the warranty group cna national warranty corporation and fidelity warranty services the third party that provides gap products is safeguard products international llc if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide epp products make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations changes in these laws and regulations or our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations our sale of used vehicles is subject to state and local licensing requirements federal and state laws regulating vehicle advertising and state laws regulating vehicle sales and service our provision of vehicle financing is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies and large employers generally including federal employment practices securities and tax laws for additional discussion of these laws and regulations see the section of this form 10k titled “ business –  laws and regulations ” 

the violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against our business operations any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations 

changes in federal labor policy could lead to increased unionization efforts which could increase labor costs disrupt store operations and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities continue to scrutinize advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced see the risk factor titled “ we operate in a highly competitive   industry ” for discussion of this risk 

our failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business sales   and results of operations 

our growth is dependent both on opening stores in new and existing markets and continued sales growth in our existing stores the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our information systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our new store growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations sales growth in our existing stores requires that we continue to effectively execute our business strategies and implement new and ongoing initiatives to elevate the experience of our customers the expansion of our store base and implementation of new initiatives also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion see the risk factor above titled “ our success depends upon the   continued contributions of our more than   25000   associates ” for discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base also requires real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are forced to curtail or stop new store growth or the implementation of our customer experience initiatives it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated information systems to run our business the failure of these systems or the inability to enhance our capabilities   could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to manage sales inventory our customerfacing websites and applications carmaxcom carmax mobile apps and carmaxauctionscom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary or the inability to enhance our information technology capabilities could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

in addition despite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems we could be subjected to attacks by hackers including denialofservice attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations see the risk factor above titled “ we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers ” for the risks associated with a breach of confidential customer or associate information 

we are subject to various legal proceedings if the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to carmax it could   have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various litigation matters from time to time which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these claims could be asserted under a variety of laws including but not limited to consumer finance laws consumer protection laws intellectual property laws privacy laws labor and employment laws securities laws and employee benefit laws these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers including manufacturer recalls 

adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles including the supply of latemodel used vehicles in addition manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years because we do not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs some vehicles we sell may have unrepaired safety recalls such recalls and our lack of authorization to make recallrelated repairs could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates as well as changes in accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of carmax’s assets liabilities revenues expenses and earnings if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

the implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on thirdparty vendors for key components of our business 

many components of our business including data management key operational processes and critical customer systems are provided by third parties we carefully select our thirdparty vendors but we do not control their actions if our vendors fail to perform as we expect our operations and reputation could suffer if the failure harms the vendors’ ability to serve us and our customers the use of thirdparty vendors represents an unavoidable inherent risk to our company that could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 

we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

our business is sensitive to weather events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain hail snow wind storms hurricanes extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

we are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated 

our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us california texas and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

we conduct our retail vehicle operations primarily in two formats – production and nonproduction stores production stores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production stores have more service bays and require additional space for reconditioning activities and therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction store on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some stores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction stores until we expand our presence in that market we also have production and nonproduction stores that operate in metropolitan statistical areas “msas” of less than 600000 people which we define as small markets some of these stores also have a smaller footprint compared with our stores in larger markets 

u sed  c ar  s tores b y  f ormat as of  f ebruary 28 2018

expansion

our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services such as wholesale vehicle sales the sale of extended protection plan “epp” products which include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” and vehicle repair service we offer low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles valueadded epp products and superior customer service our website and related mobile apps are tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct part of the shopping and sales process online 

our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us and availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the sales process we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with industryleading thirdparty finance providers all of the finance offers whether by caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option 

as of february 28 2018  we operated 188  used car stores in 91  us television markets as of that date we also conducted wholesale auctions at 73  used car stores and we operated 2  new car franchises 

carmax auto finance 

in addition to thirdparty finance providers we provide vehicle financing through caf which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option as a result we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 431  of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2018  as of february 28 2018  caf serviced approximately 895000  customer accounts in its 1162 billion  portfolio of managed receivables 

management regularly analyzes caf’s operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer profitability the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses 

revenues and profitability 

during fiscal 2018  net sales and operating revenues increased 78  and net earnings increased 59  the 104  increase in earnings per share reflected the increase in net earnings and the effect of our ongoing share repurchase program net earnings was impacted by the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “2017 tax act” 

our primary source of revenue and net earnings is the retail sale of used vehicles during fiscal 2018  we sold 721512  used cars representing 841  of our net sales and operating revenues and 673  of our gross profit used vehicle revenues grew 85  and used vehicle gross profits improved 80  primarily due to a 75  increase in total used unit sales which included a 20  increase in comparable store used units 

wholesale sales are also a significant contributor to our revenues and net earnings during fiscal 2018  we sold 408509  wholesale vehicles representing 127  of our net sales and operating revenues and 169  of our gross profit wholesale vehicle revenues 

grew 47  and wholesale vehicle gross profits improved 82  due to the combination of a 43  increase in unit sales and a 38  increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit 

during fiscal 2018  other sales and revenues which include revenue earned on the sale of epp products net thirdparty finance fees and service department and new car sales represented 32  of our net sales and operating revenues and 158  of our gross profit other sales and revenues increased 47  primarily reflecting improvements in epp revenues partially offset by a decline in net thirdparty finance fees other gross profit remained consistent with the prior year as decreases in service profits and net thirdparty finance fees were largely offset by the increase in epp revenues 

income from our caf segment totaled 4212 million  in fiscal 2018  up 141  compared with fiscal 2017  the increase in caf income was primarily due to an increase in average managed receivables and a decline in the provision for loan losses partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage 

during fiscal 2018  selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased 86  to 162 billion  primarily reflecting the 9  increase in our store base since the beginning of fiscal 2018  as well as an increase in the accrual for corporate incentive pay and spending on strategic initiatives partially offset by a decrease in sharebased compensation 

the effective income tax rate was 376  in fiscal 2018  compared with 377  in fiscal 2017  the current year’s effective tax rate was affected by an 119 million increase in tax expense as a result of the enactment of the 2017 tax act including 

 

liquidity 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from nonrecourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources during fiscal 2018  net cash used in operations totaled 806 million  this amount combined with 9022 million  of net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable resulted in 8216 million  of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities a nongaap measure this liquidity together with borrowing under our revolving credit facility was primarily used to fund the 89 million  common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program and our store growth 

when considering cash provided by operating activities management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been funded with nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities for a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure see “reconciliation of adjusted net cash from operating activities” included in “financial condition – liquidity and capital resources” 

future outlook 

our longterm strategy is to complete the rollout of our retail concept and to increase our share of used vehicle unit sales in each of the markets in which we operate we believe that over the long term used vehicle unit sales are the primary driver for earnings growth we also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and over time increased caf income 

as of february 28 2018  we had used car stores located in 91  television markets which covered approximately 73  of the us population completing our rollout requires a disciplined approach to opening stores in new markets and expanding our presence in existing markets the format and operating models utilized in stores are continuously evaluated and may change or evolve over time based upon market and consumer expectations we opened 15  stores in fiscal 2018  and plan to open 15  stores in fiscal 2019  and between 13  and 16  stores in fiscal 2020  for a detailed list of stores we plan to open in fiscal 2019  see the table included in “planned future activities” 

in calendar 2017 we estimate we sold approximately 46 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the television markets in which we operate our strategy to increase our share of each of these markets includes focusing on 



 

we are investing in various strategic initiatives to increase innovation specifically with regards to customer facing and customer enabling technologies we have implemented new enterprisewide customer relationship management and mobile appraisal technologies we also continue to invest in search engine optimization and enhance our online financing and online appraisal processes our use of data is a core component of these initiatives and continues to be a strategic asset for us as we leverage data in new ways to enhance customer experience and increase operational efficiencies 

while we execute our longterm strategy there are trends and factors that could impact our strategic approach or our results in the short and medium term a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory is sourced from local regional and online wholesale auto auctions wholesale vehicle prices are influenced by a variety of factors including the supply of vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand industry sources predict that there will be a continued influx in offlease vehicles in coming years which has and could continue to increase the volume of latemodel vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand while conditions in any one quarter may vary this has and could continue to reduce wholesale auction prices and our vehicle acquisition costs it could also impact caf recovery rates 

the federal statutory tax rate associated with the 2017 tax act which was enacted in our fourth quarter is expected to result in future benefits to our financial results and cash flows while the exact amount of those future benefits has not yet been determined we currently intend to use those benefits to invest in our associates and business including our digital and technology capabilities we expect that after these investments 70 to 85 of the benefit from the lower tax rate will impact our net earnings while in any individual period conditions may vary over the long term we would expect to begin leveraging our sga expenses when comparable store used unit sales growth is in the midsingle digit range in the near term while we are investing more heavily in strategic initiatives we believe the sga leverage point is likely at the higher end of this range

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving funding program composed of three warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf we typically elect to fund these receivables through an assetbacked term funding transaction such as a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement at a later date we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions including term securitizations together “nonrecourse funding vehicles” as secured borrowings which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses 

see notes 2f 2h and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loan receivables 

allowance for loan losses 

the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date such losses are expected to become evident during the following 12 months because net loss performance can vary substantially over time estimating net losses requires assumptions about matters that are uncertain 

the allowance for loan losses is estimated using a combination of analytical models and management judgment these models are primarily based on the composition of the portfolio of managed receivables including month of origination and actual prior performance of the receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves for receivables that have less than 12 months of performance history the estimate also takes into account the credit grades of the receivables and historical losses by 

credit grade to supplement actual loss data in estimating future performance once the receivables have 12 months of performance history the estimate reflects actual loss experience of those receivables to date along with forward loss curves to predict future performance the forward loss curves are constructed using historical performance data and show the average timing of losses over the course of a receivable’s life 

estimates from these models rely on historical performance information and may not fully reflect losses inherent in the present portfolio therefore management also considers recent trends in delinquencies and defaults recovery rates and the economic environment in assessing the models used in estimating the allowance for loan losses and may adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect factors that may not be captured in the models in addition management periodically considers whether the use of additional metrics would result in improved model performance and revises the models when appropriate 

determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses requires management to exercise judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain including the timing and distribution of net losses that could materially affect the allowance for loan losses and therefore net earnings to the extent that actual performance differs from our estimates additional provision for credit losses may be required that would reduce net earnings a 10 change in the estimated loss rates would have changed the allowance for loan losses by approximately 129 million as of february 28 2018  

see notes 2h and 4 for additional information on the allowance for loan losses 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5‑day moneyback guarantee we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors to customers who purchase a retail vehicle the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract we recognize revenue on a net basis at the time of sale we also record a reserve for estimated contract cancellations periodically we may receive retrospective commissions based upon the performance of the policies administered by the third parties these additional amounts are recognized as revenue when received the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience recent trends and credit mix of the customer base our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of epp sales customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates a 10 change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately 105 million as of february 28 2018  see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves 

customers applying for financing who are not approved or are conditionally approved by caf are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we recognize these fees at the time of sale 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales

during fiscal 2018  we opened 15  stores including 7 stores in 5 new television markets 3 stores in seattle wa and 1 store each in salisbury md tyler tx myrtle beach sc and portland me and 8 stores in 7 existing television markets 1 store each in pensacola fl hartford ct philadelphia pa las vegas nv boston ma and denver co and 2 stores in san francisco ca 

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    the 85  increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018  was primarily due to a 75  increase in unit sales the increase in used unit sales included a 20  increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by a continued strong conversion partially offset by lower store traffic we believe that strong execution in our stores as well as the impact of our digital initiatives contributed to our continued improvements in conversion our data indicates that in our television markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by almost 7 in calendar 2017 

average retail selling price for fiscal 2018  remained relatively consistent with the prior year reflecting the net effects of shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class and lower vehicle acquisition costs decreases in vehicle acquisition costs in the first half of the year were largely offset by increases in the second half of the year we believe lower seasonal depreciation was a significant driver of the increase in vehicle acquisition costs in the second half of the year at the same time industry new vehicle transaction prices benefited from aggressive new car incentives we believe the resulting change in the relative affordability of new vehicles versus latemodel vehicles was one of the factors contributing to our comparable store used unit sales performance 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    the 67  increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017  resulted from an 83  increase in unit sales combined with a 17  decline in average retail selling price the increase in used unit sales included a 43  increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit sales performance resulted from an increase in conversion partially offset by a slight decline in store traffic 

we believe the decline in store traffic was predominantly the result of a decline in customers typically financed by tier 3 providers the decline in tier 3 sales was the result of tightened lending standards by one of our thirdparty tier 3 finance providers that we experienced starting in the middle of the first quarter of fiscal 2017  and lower applicant volume within this credit tier our data indicates that in our television markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by approximately 2 in calendar 2016 

the decline in average retail selling price reflected the net effects of lower vehicle acquisition costs and shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class we believe the increased supply of latemodel vehicles available at auction contributed to the lower acquisition costs which in turn helped to increase the value proposition of latemodel used vehicles relative to new cars 

wholesale vehicle sales 

vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are on average approximately 10 years old with more than 100000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    the 47  increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2018  resulted from a 43  increase in wholesale unit sales during fiscal 2018  increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to an increase in our appraisal buy rate and growth in our store base were partially offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic we believe the appraisal buy rate benefited from strong wholesale industry vehicle valuations which allowed us to provide seasonally strong appraisal offers wholesale vehicle average selling price for fiscal 2018  remained consistent with the prior year 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    the 48  decrease in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017  resulted from a 41  decrease in wholesale vehicle average selling prices and a 07  decrease in wholesale unit sales during fiscal 2017  increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to the growth in our store base and an improved appraisal buy rate were more than offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic in particular we experienced a reduced mix of 7 to 9year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix which we believe resulted at least in part from the reduced overall industry supply of these model year vehicles due to the decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession this shift in mix also contributed to the decline in average selling price 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of esps and gap collectively reported in epp revenues net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are predominantly comprised of service department and new vehicle sales the fees we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers the mix of our retail vehicles financed by caf tier 2 and tier 3 providers or customers that arrange their own financing may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants changes in providers’ credit decisioning and external market conditions changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    other sales and revenues increased 47  in fiscal 2018  epp revenues increased 101   compared with the prior year largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales the 115 million  reduction in net thirdparty finance fees reflected shifts in our sales mix by finance channel including a decline in our tier 2 and an increase in our tier 3 sales 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    other sales and revenues remained consistent in fiscal 2017  as changes in the underlying components offset one another new vehicle sales declined due to the disposal of two of our four new car franchises during fiscal 2016  epp revenues increased 141  largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales and pricing changes net thirdparty finance fees improved by 376  primarily due to the reduced proportion of our used unit sales financed by tier 3 finance providers

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit 

we systematically adjust individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include the wholesale and retail vehicle pricing environments vehicle reconditioning and logistics costs and the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    the 80  increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018  was primarily driven by the 75  growth in total used unit sales despite an overall trend reported by publicly traded auto retailers in recent quarters towards lower gross profit per unit sold our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2017  we believe we can manage to a targeted gross profit per unit dollar range subject to future changes to our business or pricing strategy 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    the 84  increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017  was primarily driven by the 83  growth in total used unit sales our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2016  

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    the 82  increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2018  was driven by the 43  increase in wholesale unit sales and the 35  or 38  increase in wholesale gross profit per unit we believe our wholesale gross profit per unit benefited from a lower depreciation environment relative to historical trends 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    the 66  decrease in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017  reflected the combination of the 07  decrease in wholesale unit sales and a 58  or 59  reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit the decline in gross profit per unit was due in part to the reduced proportion of 7 to 9year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix in addition compared with fiscal 2016  differences in the rate of depreciation relative to changes in our appraisal offers contributed to the decline in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are predominantly comprised of service department operations including used vehicle reconditioning and new vehicle sales we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent revenues paid to us by certain thirdparty providers thirdparty finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to thirdparty tier 3 finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    other gross profit remained consistent in fiscal 2018  as a 192 million decrease in service profits and the decrease in net thirdparty finance fees discussed above were largely offset by the noted increase in epp revenues service profits were affected by the reduced leverage of service department costs resulting from our more modest comparable store used unit growth in the latter half of fiscal 2018  

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    other gross profit rose 263  in fiscal 2017  primarily reflecting the improvement in epp revenues and net thirdparty finance fees discussed above the decrease in new vehicle sales did not significantly affect other gross profit 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not had a significant impact on results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices however changes in average vehicle selling prices impact caf income to the extent the average amount financed also changes 

sga expenses 

  

c omponents of sga e xpenses 

 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    sga expenses for fiscal 2018  increased 86  the increase primarily reflected the 9  growth in our store base during fiscal 2018  representing the addition of 15  stores an 180 million increase in the corporate incentive pay accrual and higher variable costs associated with our comparable store unit growth these increases were partially offset by a 277 million decrease in sharebased compensation expense which reduced sga per used unit by 47 the decrease in sharebased compensation expense reflected higher costs incurred in fiscal 2017 in connection with the retirement of our former chief executive officer as well as a decrease in the expense related to cashsettled restricted stock units in fiscal 2018  the expense associated with these units was primarily driven by the change in the company’s stock price during the fiscal year the 193 million  or 81  increase in other overhead costs included increased spending related to strategic initiatives 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    sga expenses for fiscal 2017  increased 101  the increase primarily reflected the 9 growth in our store base during fiscal 2017  representing the addition of 15 stores and a 357 million increase in sharebased compensation expense the increase in sharebased compensation expense increased sga per used unit by 47 and was largely related to cashsettled restricted stock units which are awards provided broadly to nonexecutive associates in our organization the fiscal 2017  sharebased compensation expense included approximately 10 million of incremental expense related to awards granted or modified by the board of directors to our former chief executive officer the 415 million or 209 increase in other overhead costs included increased spending related to strategic initiatives 

interest expense 

interest expense includes the interest related to short and longterm debt and finance and capital lease obligations it does not include interest on the nonrecourse notes payable which is reflected within caf income 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    interest expense increased to 707 million  in fiscal 2018  versus 564 million  in fiscal 2017  the increase reflected the combined effects of higher outstanding debt levels and interest rates in fiscal 2018  as well as a reduction in capitalized interest 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    interest expense increased to 564 million  in fiscal 2017  versus 364 million  in fiscal 2016  the increase reflected the combination of planned higher outstanding debt levels in fiscal 2017  as part of our capital structure strategy as well as growth in our finance and capital lease obligations during fiscal 2017 we sold 500 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2023 2026 and 2028 to investors in a private placement 

other expense 

during fiscal 2016  we recorded a onetime charge of 83 million associated with a property that was no longer planned to be used 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 376  in fiscal 2018  377  in fiscal 2017  and 383  in fiscal 2016  the 2017 tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 the provision with the most significant impact to carmax was the reduction of the federal statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 

the 2017 tax act increased our fiscal 2018 income tax expense by 119 million which was made up of the following 

 

these combined effects resulted in a net impact to our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate of 11 percentage points in future quarters we anticipate that our effective tax rate will generally be around 25 this rate is subject to volatility associated with the adoption in fiscal 2018 of financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” asu 201609 regarding sharebased compensation 

results of operations – carmax auto finance 

caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses 

  

caf’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multiyear period we strive to originate loans with an underlying risk profile that we believe will in the aggregate and excluding caf’s tier 3 originations result in cumulative net losses in the 2 to 25 range over the life of the loans actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations economic conditions and wholesale recovery rates current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business including the volume of loans originated current interest rates charged to consumers loan terms and average credit scores because we recognize caf income over the life of the underlying auto loan loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period’s financial results

l oan p erformance i nformation 

 

fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017    caf income increased 141  in fiscal 2018  which was due to an increase in the average managed receivables and a decline in the provision for loan losses partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage average managed receivables grew 104  to 1121 billion  in fiscal 2018  driven primarily by the rise in caf loan originations in recent years the growth in net loan originations in fiscal 2018  resulted from our used vehicle sales growth and an increase in average amount financed partially offset by a decrease in cafs penetration rate 

the provision for loan losses declined to 1376 million  in fiscal 2018  from 1506 million  in fiscal 2017  the prior year’s provision was affected by rising loss experience while losses were generally consistent with expectations in fiscal 2018  as a result the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables was 111  as of february 28 2018  compared with 116  as of february 28 2017  changes in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables reflect the effect of the change in loss and delinquency experience on our outlook for net losses expected to occur over the next 12 months 

the total interest margin which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs declined to 57  of average managed receivables from 58  in fiscal 2017  this was the result of a gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to consumers and our funding costs in recent years changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time continued increases in interest rates which affect caf’s funding costs or other competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    caf income declined 59  in fiscal 2017  the decline was due to an increase in the provision for loan losses and lower total interest margin percentage partially offset by the increase in average managed receivables average managed receivables grew 117  to 1016 billion  in fiscal 2017  driven by the rise in caf loan originations in recent years the growth in net loan originations in fiscal 2017  resulted from our used vehicle sales growth and an increase in cafs penetration rate that was caused by an increased mix of credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum 

the total interest margin declined to 58  of average managed receivables from 61  in fiscal 2016  this was due to the same reasons noted above in the fiscal 2018  versus fiscal 2017  comparison 

the provision for loan losses rose to 1506 million  in fiscal 2017  from 1012 million  in fiscal 2016  due to unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017  as well as the growth in managed receivables while higher loss rates were primarily due to an increase in chargeoffs lower recovery rates also contributed to the unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017  which we believe reflected conditions impacting our industry as a whole 

tier 3 loan originations   caf also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers in order to better understand the performance of these loans mitigate risk and add incremental profits caf currently targets originating approximately 5 of the total tier 3 loan volume however this rate may vary over time based on market conditions a total of 1475 million and 1233 million in caf tier 3 receivables were outstanding as of february 28 2018  and 2017  respectively these loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the caf portfolio as well as higher contract rates as of february 28 2018  and 2017  approximately 10 of the total allowance for loan losses related to the outstanding caf tier 3 loan balances 

planned future activities 

  

we currently plan to open 15  stores in fiscal 2019  and between 13  and 16  stores in fiscal 2020  in fiscal 2019  we will be entering nine new television markets and expanding our presence in six existing television markets of the 15  stores we plan to open in fiscal 2019  10 are in metropolitan statistical areas “msas” having populations of 600000 or less which we define as small markets we currently estimate capital expenditures will total   approximately   340 million   in fiscal 2019

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations store expansion   and improvement and caf since fiscal 2013 we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from nonrecourse funding vehicles and borrowings under our revolving credit facility   or through other financing sources 

we currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35 to 45 in calculating this ratio we utilize total debt excluding nonrecourse notes payable a multiple of 8 times rent expense and total shareholders’ equity we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources together with stock repurchases to maintain this targeted ratio however in any period we may be outside this range due to seasonal market strategic or other factors 

  

operating activities  during fiscal 2018  net cash used in operating activities totaled 806 million  compared with 4553 million  in fiscal 2017  and 1168 million  in fiscal 2016  the net cash used in operating activities includes increases in auto loan receivables of 108 billion  in fiscal 2018  121 billion  in fiscal 2017  and 120 billion  in fiscal 2016  the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities 

  

as of february 28 2018  total inventory was 239 billion  representing an increase of 1301 million  or 58  compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year the increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2018  as well as an increase in acquisition costs resulting from higher wholesale valuations especially in the months following hurricanes harvey and irma 

as of february 28 2017  total inventory was 226 billion  representing an increase of 3285   million or   170 compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year   the increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2017  increased inventory levels were also a result of changes in the timing in federal income tax refunds that impacted the timing of anticipated sales in february 2017 these increases were partially offset by a decline in the average carrying cost of inventory due to changes in acquisition costs 

when considering cash provided by operating activities management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in nonrecourse notes payable this is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were funded through the issuance of nonrecourse notes payable during the year the resulting financial measure adjusted net cash from operating activities is a nongaap financial measure we believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations including the increases in nonrecourse notes payable net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows

compared with fiscal 2017  the increase in fiscal 2018  adjusted net cash provided by operating activities reflected the change in inventory during fiscal 2018  and the increase in net earnings when excluding noncash expenses which include depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation expense the provisions for loan losses and cancellation reserves and the deferred income tax provision these increases were partially offset by the timing and use of nonrecourse funding vehicles in relation to originations of auto loan receivables 

compared with fiscal 2016 the decrease in fiscal 2017  adjusted net cash provided by operating activities reflected the change in inventory partially offset by the timing of payments related to operating payables and an increase in net earnings when excluding noncash expenses in addition the increase in net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable was primarily attributable to loan origination growth as well as the new warehouse facility being used to fund certain of caf’s tier 3 loans in fiscal 2016 all of cafs tier 3 loans were funded through the use of existing working capital 

  

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities totaled 3268 million  in fiscal 2018  4656 million  in fiscal 2017  and 3788 million  in fiscal 2016  investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled   2968 million  in fiscal 2018    4181 million  in fiscal 2017  and   3156 million  in fiscal 2016     capital expenditures primarily include store construction costs real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store remodeling expenses we maintain a multiyear pipeline of sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years   we opened 15  stores in both fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  and we opened 14  stores and relocated 1 store in fiscal 2016  the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018  largely reflected reduced spending on construction and land acquisitions resulting from changes in the mix of markets in which stores were being built 

  

financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities totaled 4134 million  in fiscal 2018  9219 million  in fiscal 2017  and 5053 million  in fiscal 2016  included in these amounts were net increases in total nonrecourse notes payable of   9022 million  121 billion  and 106 billion  respectively which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of 108 billion  121 billion  and 120 billion  respectively in auto loan receivables see operating activities during 

fiscal 2018  we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by 426 million  during fiscal 2017  we sold 500 million  of senior unsecured notes in a private placement and used a portion of the proceeds to reduce net borrowings under our revolving credit facility during fiscal 2016  we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by 4046 million  net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of   5796 million  in fiscal 2018  5643 million  in fiscal 2017   and 9839 million   in fiscal 2016  

t otal d ebt and c ash and c ash e quivalents 

 

we have a 120 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in august 2020  borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us we also have a 300 million  unsecured variablerate term loan which is due in august 2020  in addition we have 500 million of fixedrate senior unsecured notes which are due in 2023 2026 and 2028 the credit facility term loan and senior note agreements contain representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements were not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity 

finance and capital lease obligations relate primarily to stores subject to saleleaseback transactions that did not qualify for sale accounting and therefore are accounted for as financings payments on the leases are recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the obligations in the event the leases are modified or extended beyond their original lease term the related obligation is increased based on the present value of the revised future minimum lease payments with a corresponding increase to the assets subject to these transactions upon modification the amortization of the obligation is reset resulting in more of the lease payments being applied to interest expense in the initial years following the modification 

see note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility term loan senior notes and finance and capital lease obligations 

caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through our warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions these nonrecourse funding vehicles are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our nonrecourse funding vehicles even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the related receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these nonrecourse funding vehicles 

the timing of principal payments on the nonrecourse notes payable is based on the timing of principal collections and defaults on the related auto loan receivables the current portion of nonrecourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period 

as of february 28 2018  981 billion  of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to assetbacked term funding transactions these notes payable have scheduled maturities through july 2024  but they may mature earlier depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables during fiscal 2018  we funded a total of 525 billion  in assetbacked term funding transactions 

as of february 28 2018  183 billion  of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time as our store base sales and caf loan originations have grown in fiscal 2018  we increased the combined limit of our warehouse facilities by 340 million  as of february 28 2018  the combined warehouse facility limit was 314 billion  and the unused warehouse capacity totaled 131 billion  of the combined warehouse 

facility limit 130 billion  will expire in august 2018  1400 million  will expire in september 2018  and 170 billion  will expire in february 2019  see notes 2f and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

the agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to fund receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the related receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

we expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations borrowings under existing new or expanded credit facilities and other funding arrangements will be sufficient to fund caf capital expenditures repurchases of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements 

the timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on share price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock as of february 28 2018  a total of 275 billion  of board authorizations for repurchases were outstanding with no expiration date at that date 102 billion  remained available for repurchase see note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate exposure  nonrecourse notes payable 

as of february 28 2018  and 2017  all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved primarily through nonrecourse funding vehicles that in turn issued both fixed and variablerate notes nonrecourse funding vehicles include warehouse facilities and assetbacked term funding transactions 

borrowings under our warehouse facilities are variablerate debt and are secured by auto loan receivables the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through an assetbacked term funding transaction which issue notes payable that accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates 

interest rate risk related to variablerate debt is primarily mitigated by entering into derivative instruments our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

absent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk a 100basis point increase in market interest rates associated with nonrecourse funding vehicles would have decreased our fiscal 2018  net earnings per share by approximately 006  

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities

interest rate exposure  other debt 

we have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our term loan however a portion of the variablerate risk is mitigated by a derivative instrument substantially all of these borrowings are variablerate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2018  net earnings per share by less than 001  

other market exposures 

our pension plan has interest rate risk related to its projected benefit obligation pbo due to the relatively young overall age of the plan’s participants a 100basis point change in the discount rate has approximately a 20  effect on the pbo balance a 100basis point decrease in the discount rate would have decreased our fiscal 2018  net earnings per share by less than 001  see note 10 for more information on our benefit plans 

  

as our cashsettled restricted stock units are liability awards the related compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the company’s stock price the marktomarket effect on the liability depends on each award’s grant price and previously recognized expense at february 28 2018  a 100 change in the company’s stock price would have affected fiscal 2018  net earnings per share by less than 001

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background 

carmax inc delivers an unrivaled customer experience by offering a broad selection of quality used vehicles and related products and services at low nohaggle prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility as well as through carmaxcom and our mobile apps by focusing on customer service associate development and efficient execution we are the nation’s largest retailer of used cars selling 671294  used vehicles at retail during the fiscal year ended february 28 2017  in addition we are one of the nation’s largest operators of wholesale vehicle auctions and one of the nation’s largest providers of used vehicle financing 

carmax was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax store in richmond virginia on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company as of february 28 2017  we operated 173  used car stores in 86  us television markets our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

carmax business 

we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations   our carmax sales operations segment sells used vehicles purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources sells related products and services and arranges financing options for customers all for fixed nohaggle prices we enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer 

purchasing a vehicle  

the vehicle purchase process in a carmax store differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience our nohaggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers in addition our sales consultants are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate this pay structure aligns our sales associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

we recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our carmax quality certified standards and each vehicle must pass an inspection before being offered for sale we stand behind every used vehicle we sell with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty our carmax quality certified standards were developed internally by carmax and are not affiliated with any third party or original equipment manufacturer program 

we maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory of more than 65000  vehicles as of february 28 2017  available for viewing on carmaxcom as well as our mobile apps upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in this inventory to a local store this allows a single carmax store to offer access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer in fiscal 2017  approximately 30  of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request 

in addition to retailing used vehicles we sell new vehicles at two  locations under franchise agreements 

selling us a vehicle  

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a customer’s vehicle free of charge and make a written guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us this nohaggle offer is good for seven days 

based on age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through our instore appraisal process meet our retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers as of february 28 2017  we conducted wholesale auctions at 72  of our 173  stores during fiscal 2017  we sold 391686  wholesale vehicles through these onsite auctions with an average auction sales rate of approximately 95  

financing a vehicle  

the availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process and having an array of finance sources increases approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax our finance program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both caf and thirdparty providers we believe that our processes and systems transparency of pricing and vehicle quality as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit allow caf and our thirdparty providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment all finance offers whether from caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge 

related products and services  

we provide customers with a range of other related products and services including extended protection plan “epp” products and vehicle repair service epp products include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” which is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business in fiscal 2017  approximately 60  of the customers who purchased a retail used vehicle also purchased an esp and approximately 20  purchased gap 

carmax auto finance   caf provides financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide customers with a competitive financing option caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history and other credit data of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely through carmax stores our scoring models are optimized for the carmax channel we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 442  of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2017  

caf also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements collecting payments maintaining contact with delinquent customers and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans as of february 28 2017  caf serviced approximately 808000  customer accounts in its 1068 billion  portfolio of managed receivables 

competition 

carmax sales operations   the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and we face competition from franchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles independent used car dealers online and mobile sales platforms and private parties according to industry sources as of december 31 2016  there were approximately 18000  franchised dealers in the us who we consider to be our primary retail competitors as they sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles competition in our industry is increasingly affected by the use of internetbased marketing and other internetbased tools for both consumers and the dealers with whom we compete 

based on industry data there were approximately 40 million  used cars sold in the us in calendar 2016  of which approximately 23 million  were estimated to be 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us in calendar 2016  we estimate we sold approximately 44  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the television markets in which we operate our market share is generally the highest in markets in which we have been established for many years entering large new markets likely will have a dampening effect on our market share given that our initial market share in large markets is generally much lower than our average on a nationwide basis we estimate we sold less than 3  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in calendar year 2016  

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our low nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on site and via carmaxcom and our mobile apps the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems the transparency and availability of caf and thirdparty financing the locations of our retail stores and our commitment to evolving our carbuying experience to meet customers’ changing 

expectations in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our high volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards 

our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast to the highly fragmented used vehicle retail market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc which together represent an estimated 70  of the north american wholesale car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax’s auctions predominantly sell older higher mileage vehicles 

carmax auto finance   caf operates and is a significant participant in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies according to industry sources this sector represented more than 1 trillion  in outstanding receivables as of december 31 2016  caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars 

we believe that caf’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source in carmax stores and that caf’s primary driver for growth is the growth in carmax’s retail used unit sales we periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness we also monitor 3day payoffs as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our offer 

products and services 

retail merchandising   we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including domestic imported and luxury vehicles at competitive prices our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old these vehicles generally range in price from 11000 to 34000 the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences seasonality and market availability 

wholesale auctions   the typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase our auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis 

  

extended protection plans   at the time of sale we offer customers epp products we receive revenue for selling these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors we have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements the esps we currently offer on all used retail vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract the epps that we sell other than manufacturer programs on new car sales have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements periodically we may receive additional revenue based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products 

reconditioning and service   an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our internal standards before it can become a carmax quality certified vehicle this process includes an inspection of the engine and all major systems based on this inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our internal quality standards many of our stores depend upon nearby typically larger carmax stores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services including but not limited to services related to manufacturer’s warranties we engage third parties specializing in those services carmax does not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs and some vehicles carmax sells may have unrepaired safety recalls however we review any unrepaired safety recall information as reported by the national highway traffic safety administration with our used vehicle customers before purchase 

in addition all carmax used car stores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by the esps we sell 

customer credit   we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and arrangements with several financial institutions vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicle as of february 28 2017  our thirdparty finance providers included ally financial american credit acceptance capital one auto finance exeter finance corp santander consumer usa wells fargo dealer services and westlake financial services we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers and we periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

credit applications submitted by customers to carmax are initially reviewed by caf using our proprietary underwriting standards based on that review caf makes financing offers designed to create a loan portfolio that meets our targeted risk profile in the aggregate applications that caf declines or approves with conditions are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers thirdparty providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we refer to the providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as tier 3 providers we are willing to pay a fee to tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that they may not otherwise be able to obtain all fees either received or paid are prenegotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount financed the interest rate the term of the loan or the loantovalue ratio caf also provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a tier 3 provider 

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

suppliers for used vehicles 

we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process as well as through local regional and online auctions we also to a lesser extent acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market 

the supply of latemodel used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the rate of new vehicle sales which in turn generate used car tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry sources there were approximately 265 million  light vehicles in operation in the us as of december 31 2016  during calendar year 2016  over 17 million  new cars and approximately 40 million  used cars were sold at retail many of which were accompanied by tradeins and more than 11 million  vehicles were sold at wholesale auctions 

based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year consumer acceptance of our instore appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

seasonality 

historically our business has been seasonal our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter we typically experience an increase in traffic and sales in february and march coinciding with tax refund season 

systems 

our stores are supported by proprietary information systems that improve the customer experience while providing highly integrated automation of all operating functions including our credit processing information system our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity 

our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location leveraging our more than twenty years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles our system generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that take into account factors that include sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

marketing and advertising 

our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmaxcom and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle these strategies are implemented through a broad range of media types our website and related mobile apps are marketing tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct part of the shopping and sales process online our website and mobile apps also include a variety of other customer service features including the ability to initiate vehicle transfers schedule appointments and apply for financing preapproval information 

on the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated several times per day our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2017  approximately 90  of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online 

associates 

on february 28 2017  we had a total of 24344  full and parttime associates including 17680  hourly and salaried associates and 6664  sales associates who predominantly worked on a commission basis we employ additional associates during peak selling seasons we believe we have created a unique corporate culture and maintain good employee relations no associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement we focus on developing our associates and providing them with the information and resources they need to offer exceptional customer service and have been recognized for the success of our efforts by a number of external organizations 

intellectual property

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business sales results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

we operate in a highly competitive   industry failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation’s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of the internet to market buy sell and finance used vehicles could adversely affect   our business sales and results of operations 

  

automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers and online and mobile sales platforms as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices new car dealers in particular including publiclytraded auto retailers have increased their sales of used vehicles in recent years these new car dealers also leverage their franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers to brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax 

retail competition   some of our competitors have announced plans for rapid expansion including into markets with carmax locations and some of them have begun to execute those plans some of our competitors have also replicated or attempted to replicate portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car store in 1993 including our use of low nohaggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer’s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us if we fail to respond effectively to our retail competitors it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

online sales and facilitation   the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles and to provide vehicle financing could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations emerging competitors using online focused business models both for direct sales and consumertoconsumer facilitation could materially impact our current business model the online availability of used vehicle information including pricing information could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines and online classified sites that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmaxcom to attract traffic these companies could also make it more difficult for carmax to otherwise market its vehicles online 

the increasing use of the internet to facilitate consumers’ sales or tradeins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations for example certain websites provide online appraisal tools to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than carmax 

in addition to the direct competition and increasing use of the internet described above there are companies that sell software and data solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to among other things more efficiently source and price inventory although these companies do not compete with carmax the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with carmax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of carmax’s internally developed proprietary systems 

if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures or to changes in the used vehicle marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

caf competition   our caf segment is subject to competition from various financial institutions including banks and credit unions which provide vehicle financing to consumers if we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our thirdparty finance providers which are generally less profitable to carmax or through other outside financing sources moreover if caf competitors are able to attract potential customers before they visit carmax whether through competitive finance offers or ease of customer experience they may be directed to retail options other than carmax accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance offers to our customers or our finance competitors are able to successfully attract and redirect a disproportionate number of our potential customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

evolving marketplace   the marketplace for used vehicles may be impacted by the significant and likely accelerating changes to the broader automotive industry technological changes including the development of autonomous vehicles new products and services new business models and new methods of travel could reduce automotive retail demand or disrupt our current business model if we fail to respond effectively to the evolving marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

carmax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our   business sales and results of operations 

our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and could involve among other things our sales process our provision of financing our reconditioning process or our treatment of customers even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results 

the growing use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected we monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns provide accurate information and protect our reputation but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions these conditions could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to national and regional us economic conditions these conditions include but are not limited to recession inflation interest rates unemployment levels the state of the housing market gasoline prices consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general these conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as acts of terrorism when these economic conditions worsen or stagnate it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally on demand from particular consumer categories or demand for particular vehicle types it can also negatively impact availability of credit to finance vehicle purchases for all or certain categories of consumers this could result in lower sales decreased margins on units sold and decreased profits for our caf segment worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of latemodel used vehicles as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time this could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold 

  

any significant change or deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business is dependent upon capital to fund growth and to support the activities of our caf   segment changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our   business sales results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support our geographic expansion could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth although in recent years internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to fund geographic expansion there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows sufficient to fund growth failure to do so—or our decision to put our cash to other uses—would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our geographic expansion 

changes in the availability or cost of the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loan receivables through caf could adversely affect sales and results of operations we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our revolving credit facility term loan senior unsecured notes and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions—especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows—could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our   more than 24000 associates 

  

our associates are the driving force behind our success we believe that one of the things that sets carmax apart is a culture centered on valuing all associates in addition our strategic initiatives require management employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities our failure to maintain this culture or to continue recruiting developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates our growth plans changes in employment legislation and competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and for qualified service technicians in particular our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is also subject to our ability to maintain positive associate relations if we are unable to do so or if despite our efforts we become subject to successful unionization efforts it could increase costs limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our success also depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers a breach of this confidentiality whether due to a cybersecurity or other incident could result in harm to our customers and damage to our brand 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers this information includes the information customers provide when purchasing a vehicle and applying for vehicle financing we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential associate information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers although we have taken measures designed to safeguard such information and have received assurances from our thirdparty providers our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty providers could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events numerous national retailers have disclosed security breaches involving sophisticated cyberattacks that were not recognized or detected until after such retailers had been affected notwithstanding the preventive measures such retailers had in place any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or associate information whether experienced by us or by our thirdparty service providers and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident a programming error or other cause could damage our reputation expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement disrupt our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to such a security breach could exacerbate the consequences of the breach 

our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles 

any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for example if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap in addition any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins 

we may experience greater credit losses in caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables than anticipated 

we are exposed to the risk that our customers who finance their purchases through caf will be unable or unwilling to repay their loans according to their terms and that the vehicle collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to ensure full repayment credit losses are inherent in caf’s business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we make various assumptions and judgments about caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors although management will establish an allowance for loan losses it believes is appropriate this allowance may not be adequate for example if economic conditions were to deteriorate unexpectedly additional loan losses 

not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses may occur losses in excess of the existing allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory obstacles to acquiring inventory—whether because of supply competition or other factors—or a failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations although the supply of latemodel used vehicles has been increasing there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that it will benefit carmax 

we source a significant percentage of our vehicles though our appraisal process and these vehicles are generally more profitable for carmax accordingly if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or fail to recognize those trends it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory it could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from thirdparty auctions which is generally less profitable for carmax our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition both from new and used car dealers directly and through thirdparty websites driving appraisal traffic to those dealers see the risk factor above titled “ we operate in a highly competitive   industry ” for discussion of this risk our ability to source vehicles from thirdparty auctions could be affected by an increase in the number of closed auctions that are open only to new car dealers who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers 

used vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk accordingly if we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

we rely on thirdparty finance providers to finance a significant portion of our customers’ vehicle purchases accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties 

we provide financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty finance providers if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide financing to our customers provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers to supply epp products to our customers accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these thirdparties 

we receive revenue for selling epp products on behalf of unrelated thirdparties who are the primary obligors the third parties that provide esps are the warranty group cna national warranty corporation and fidelity warranty services the third party that provides gap products is safeguard products international llc if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide epp products make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations changes in these laws and regulations or our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations our sale of used vehicles is subject to state and local licensing requirements federal and state laws regulating vehicle advertising and state laws regulating vehicle sales and service our provision of vehicle financing is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies and large employers generally including federal employment practices securities and tax laws for additional discussion of these laws and regulations see the section of this form 10k titled “ business –  laws and regulations ” 

the violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against our business operations any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business 

sales and results of operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations 

changes in federal labor policy could lead to increased unionization efforts which could increase labor costs disrupt store operations and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities continue to scrutinize advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced see the risk factor titled “ we operate in a highly competitive   industry ” for discussion of this risk 

our failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business sales   and results of operations 

our growth is dependent both on opening stores in new and existing markets and continued sales growth in our existing stores the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our information systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our new store growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations sales growth in our existing stores requires that we continue to effectively execute our business strategies and implement new and ongoing initiatives to elevate the experience of our customers the expansion of our store base and implementation of new initiatives also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion see the risk factor above titled “ our success depends upon the   continued contributions of our more than   24000   associates ” for discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base also requires real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are forced to curtail or stop new store growth or the implementation of our customer experience initiatives it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated information systems to run our business the failure of these systems or the inability to enhance our capabilities   could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to manage sales inventory our customerfacing websites and applications carmaxcom carmax mobile apps and carmaxauctionscom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary or the inability to enhance our information technology capabilities could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

in addition despite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems we could be subjected to attacks by hackers including denialofservice attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations see the risk factor above titled “ we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers ” for the risks associated with a breach of confidential customer or associate information 

we are subject to various legal proceedings if the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to carmax it could   have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various litigation matters from time to time which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these claims could be asserted under a variety of laws including but not limited to consumer finance laws consumer protection laws intellectual property laws privacy laws labor and employment laws securities laws and employee benefit laws these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers including manufacturer recalls 

adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles including the supply of latemodel used vehicles in addition manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years because we do not have manufacturer authorization to complete recallrelated repairs some vehicles we sell may have unrepaired safety recalls such recalls and our lack of authorization to make recallrelated repairs could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates as well as changes in accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of carmax’s assets liabilities revenues expenses and earnings if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

the implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on thirdparty vendors for key components of our business 

many components of our business including data management key operational processes and critical customer systems are provided by third parties we carefully select our thirdparty vendors but we do not control their actions if our vendors fail to perform as we expect our operations and reputation could suffer if the failure harms the vendors’ ability to serve us and our customers the use of thirdparty vendors represents an unavoidable inherent risk to our company that could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 

we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

our business is sensitive to weather events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain hail snow wind storms hurricanes extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

we are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated 

our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us california texas and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we generally conduct our retail vehicle operations in two formats – production and nonproduction stores production stores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production stores have more service bays and require additional space for reconditioning activities and therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction store on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some stores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction stores until we expand our presence in that market as of february 28 2017  we operated 89  production stores and 84  nonproduction stores production stores are generally on 10  to 25  acres but a few range from 25  to 35  acres and nonproduction stores are generally on 4  to 12  acres we also have small format production and nonproduction stores which are generally targeted to operate in metropolitan statistical areas “msas” of less than 600000 people these stores generally have a smaller footprint compared with our other stores 

as of february 28 2017  we operated 72  wholesale auctions most of which were located at production stores stores at which auctions are conducted generally have additional space to store wholesale inventory 

u sed  c ar  s tores as of  f ebruary 28 2017 



of the 173  used car stores open as of february 28 2017  99  were located on owned sites and 74  were located on leased sites the leases are classified as follows 



as of february 28 2017  we leased our caf office buildings in atlanta georgia and other ancillary properties to support our corporate and store operations we own our home office building in richmond virginia and land associated with planned future store openings 

expansion 

since opening our first used car store in 1993 we have grown organically through the construction and opening of companyoperated stores we do not franchise our operations as of february 28 2017  we operated in 86  us television markets which covered approximately 70  of the us population we believe that further geographic expansion and additional fillin opportunities in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2018  we plan to open 15  stores in fiscal 2019  we plan to open between 13  and 16  stores 

for additional details on our future expansion plans see “planned future activities” included in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

information in response to this item is included in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k and is incorporated herein by reference 

at its request we have provided the orange county california district attorney’s office with documents and information related to the handling storage and disposal of certain types of hazardous waste at our orange county store locations we have an ongoing dialogue with the orange county district attorney’s office regarding these matters and as part of these discussions on december 1 2016  they informed us that they had communicated the status of their informal inquiry to the environmental offices of nine other california counties based upon our evaluation of information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation all references to net earnings per share are to diluted net earnings per share amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding 

overview 

see part i item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company’s business 

  

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations 

our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services such as wholesale vehicle sales the sale of extended protection plan “epp” products which include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” and vehicle repair service we offer low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles valueadded epp products and superior customer service our website and related mobile apps are tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct part of the shopping and sales process online 

our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us and availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the sales process we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with industryleading thirdparty finance providers all of the finance offers whether by caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option 

as of february 28 2017  we operated 173  used car stores in 86  us television markets as of that date we also conducted wholesale auctions at 72  used car stores and we operated 2  new car franchises 

carmax auto finance 

in addition to thirdparty finance providers we provide vehicle financing through caf which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option as a result we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 442  of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2017  as of february 28 2017  caf serviced approximately 808000  customer accounts in its 1068 billion  portfolio of managed receivables 

management regularly analyzes caf’s operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer profitability the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses 

revenues and profitability 

during fiscal 2017  net sales and operating revenues increased 48  and net earnings increased 06  the 76  increase in earnings per share reflected the increase in net earnings and the effect of our ongoing share repurchase program 

our primary source of revenue and net income is the retail sale of used vehicles during fiscal 2017  we sold 671294  used cars representing 836  of our net sales and operating revenues and 665  of our gross profit used vehicle revenues grew 67  and used vehicle gross profits improved 84  primarily due to an 83  increase in total used unit sales which included a 43  increase in comparable store used units 

wholesale sales are also a significant contributor to our revenues and net income during fiscal 2017  we sold 391686  wholesale vehicles representing 131  of our net sales and operating revenues and 166  of our gross profit wholesale vehicle revenues 

decreased 48  and wholesale vehicle gross profits decreased 66  due to the combination of a 07  decrease in unit sales and a 59  decrease in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit 

during fiscal 2017  other sales and revenues which include revenue earned on the sale of epp products net thirdparty finance fees and service department and new car sales represented 33  of our net sales and operating revenues and 169  of our gross profit other sales and revenues remained consistent with fiscal 2016  despite the disposal of two of our four new car franchises in fiscal 2016  and other gross profit rose 263  primarily reflecting improvements in epp revenues and net thirdparty finance fees 

income from our caf segment totaled 3690 million  in fiscal 2017  down 59  compared with fiscal 2016  the decline in caf income was primarily due to an increase in the provision for loan losses and a lower total interest margin percentage 

during fiscal 2017  selling general and administrative “sga” expenses increased 101  to 149 billion  primarily reflecting the 9  increase in our store base since the beginning of fiscal 2017  as well as an increase in sharebased compensation and spending related to strategic initiatives 

liquidity 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from securitization transactions and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources during fiscal 2017  net cash used in operations totaled 4681 million  this amount combined with 121 billion  of net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable resulted in 7466 million  of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities a nongaap measure this liquidity together with a 2400 million  increase in longterm debt was primarily used to fund the 103 million  common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program our store growth and the increase in caf auto loan receivables 

when considering cash provided by operating activities management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been funded with nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities for a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure see “reconciliation of adjusted net cash from operating activities” included in “financial condition – liquidity and capital resources” 

future outlook 

over the long term we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base we also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and over time increased caf income to expand our vehicle unit sales at new and existing stores we will need to continue delivering an unrivaled customer experience in stores and online which will require investments in our information technology infrastructure and other strategic initiatives we also will need to continue hiring and developing the associates necessary to drive our success while managing the risks posed by an evolving competitive environment in addition to support our store growth plans we will need to continue procuring suitable real estate at favorable terms while in any individual period conditions may vary over the long term we would expect to begin leveraging our sga expenses when comparable store used unit sales growth is in the midsingle digit range 

we are continuing the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 28 2017  we had used car stores located in 86  us television markets which covered approximately 70  of the us population during fiscal 2017  we opened 15  stores in fiscal 2018  we plan to open 15  stores in fiscal 2019  we plan to open between 13  and 16  stores for a detailed list of stores we plan to open in fiscal 2018  see the table included in “planned future activities” 

a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory is sourced from local regional and online wholesale auto auctions wholesale vehicle prices are influenced by a variety of factors including the supply of vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand industry sources predict that there will be a continued influx in offlease vehicles in coming years which has and could continue to increase the volume of latemodel vehicles available at auction relative to dealer demand this has and could continue to reduce wholesale auction prices and our vehicle acquisition costs it could also impact caf recovery rates 

for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company see “risk factors” included in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving funding program composed of three warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf we typically elect to fund these receivables through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement at a later date we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations “funding vehicles” as secured borrowings which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses 

auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through caf the receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and defaults recovery rates and the economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance 

see notes 2f 2h and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loan receivables 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5‑day moneyback guarantee we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors to customers who purchase a retail vehicle the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract we recognize revenue on a net basis at the time of sale we also record a reserve for estimated contract cancellations periodically we may receive additional revenue based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products these additional amounts are recognized as revenue when received the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience recent trends and credit mix of the customer base our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of epp sales customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates a 10 change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately 108 million as of february 28 2017  see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves 

customers applying for financing who are not approved or are conditionally approved by caf are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we recognize these fees at the time of sale 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted see note 9 for additional information on income taxes 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider available loss carrybacks tax planning strategies future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 28 2017  will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us federal and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    the 67  increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017  resulted from an 83  increase in unit sales combined with a 17  decline in average retail selling price the increase in used unit sales included a 43  increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit sales performance resulted from an increase in conversion partially offset by a slight decline in store traffic we believe that improved execution in our stores as well as our recent website redesign and enhanced online capabilities which have made it easier for our customers to submit leads have contributed to our continued improvements in conversion 

we believe the decline in store traffic was predominantly the result of a decline in customers typically financed by tier 3 providers the decline in tier 3 sales was the result of tightened lending standards by one of our thirdparty tier 3 finance providers that we experienced starting in the middle of the first quarter of fiscal 2017  and lower applicant volume within this credit tier during fiscal 2017  we experienced an overall improvement in the credit quality of our credit applicant mix which contributed to the lower penetration rates for both tier 2 and tier 3 providers and higher penetration rates for caf and customers arranging their own financing based on our analysis of industry data we believe the shift in credit applicant mix was not unique to carmax historically the tier 3 rate of conversion of credit applications to sales has been significantly lower than that in other credit tiers as a result we believe a decline in tier 3 sales mix typically represents a disproportionate decline in underlying customer traffic for the nontier 3 customer base comparable store used unit sales rose 91 in fiscal 2017  our data indicates that in our television markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by approximately 2 in calendar 2016 

the decline in average retail selling price reflected the net effects of lower vehicle acquisition costs and shifts in the mix of our sales by both vehicle age and class generally we pass on decreases in our vehicle acquisition costs to consumers in the form of lower selling prices we believe the increased supply of latemodel vehicles available at auction is contributing to the lower acquisition costs which in turn is helping to increase the value proposition of latemodel used vehicles relative to new cars 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    the 66  increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2016  resulted from a 65  increase in used unit sales the increase in used unit sales included a 24  increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by improved conversion partially offset by a decrease in store traffic we believe that various market factors including but not limited to the availability and relative valuations of certain used vehicle inventories and new vehicle lease and price promotions may have contributed to the decrease in store traffic our data indicates that in our television markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by approximately 1 in calendar 2015 

wholesale vehicle sales 

vehicles sold at our wholesale auctions are on average approximately 10 years old with more than 100000 miles and are primarily comprised of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles being sold 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    the 48  decrease in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2017  resulted from a 41  decrease in wholesale vehicle average selling prices and a 07  decrease in wholesale unit sales during fiscal 2017  increases in wholesale unit volumes attributable to the growth in our store base and an improved appraisal buy rate were more than offset by a reduction in appraisal traffic in particular we experienced a reduced mix of 7 to 9year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix which we believe resulted at least in part from the reduced overall industry supply of these model year vehicles due to the decline in industry new vehicle sales during the recession this shift in mix also contributed to the decline in average selling price 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    the 68  increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2016  resulted from a 49  increase in wholesale unit sales and a 10  increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price the wholesale unit growth primarily reflected the growth in our store base 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of esps and gap collectively reported in epp revenues net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are predominately comprised of service department and new vehicle sales the fees we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers the mix of our retail vehicles financed by caf tier 2 and tier 3 providers or customers that arrange their own financing may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants changes in providers’ credit decisioning and external market conditions changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    other sales and revenues remained consistent in fiscal 2017  as changes in the underlying components offset one another new vehicle sales declined due to the disposal of two of our four new car franchises during fiscal 2016  epp revenues increased 141  largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales and pricing changes net thirdparty finance fees improved by 376  primarily due to the reduced proportion of our used unit sales financed by tier 3 finance providers 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    other sales and revenues decreased 42  in fiscal 2016  primarily due to our disposal of two of the four new car franchises we owned at the start of fiscal 2016 epp revenues increased 47  largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales net thirdparty finance fees improved by 35  primarily due to shifts in the mix among finance providers

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit 

we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    the 84  increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017  was primarily driven by the 83  growth in total used unit sales despite an overall trend reported by publicly traded auto retailers in recent quarters towards lower gross profit per unit sold our used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent with fiscal 2016  we believe we can manage to a targeted gross profit per unit dollar range subject to future changes to our business or pricing strategy 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    the 55  increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2016  was primarily driven by the 65  growth in total used unit sales partially offset by a modest decline in used gross profit per unit 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    the 66  decrease in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2017  reflected the combination of the 07  decrease in wholesale unit sales and a 58  or 59  reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit the decline in gross profit per unit was due in part to the reduced proportion of 7 to 9year old vehicles in our wholesale sales mix in addition compared with fiscal 2016  differences in the rate of depreciation relative to changes in our appraisal offers contributed to the decline in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    the 64  increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2016  reflected the combination of the 49  increase in wholesale unit sales with a 14 increase in wholesale gross profit per unit 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are predominantly comprised of service department operations including used vehicle reconditioning and new vehicle sales we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent revenues paid to us by certain thirdparty providers thirdparty finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to thirdparty tier 3 finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the components of other gross profit can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    other gross profit rose 263  in fiscal 2017  primarily reflecting the improvement in epp revenues and net thirdparty finance fees discussed above the decrease in new vehicle sales did not significantly affect other gross profit 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    other gross profit increased 149  in fiscal 2016  primarily reflecting the improvement in epp revenues and net thirdparty finance fees discussed above as well as an increase in service department gross profits due to a change in the timing of our recognition of reconditioning overhead costs which increased other gross profit in fiscal 2016 by 104 million these costs which previously had been expensed as incurred are now allocated to the carrying cost of inventory 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not had a significant impact on results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices however changes in average vehicle selling prices impact caf income to the extent the average amount financed also changes 

sga expenses 

  

c omponents of sga e xpenses 

   

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    sga expenses for fiscal 2017  increased 101  the increase primarily reflected the 9  growth in our store base during fiscal 2017  representing the addition of 15  stores and a 357 million  increase in sharebased compensation expense the increase in sharebased compensation expense increased sga per used unit by 47 and was largely related to cashsettled restricted stock units which are awards provided broadly to nonexecutive associates in our organization the expense associated with these units was influenced by the change in the companys stock price during the fiscal year the fiscal 2017  sharebased compensation expense included approximately 10 million of incremental expense related to awards granted or modified by the board of directors to our recently retired chief executive officer thomas j folliard mr folliard was effectively provided retirement treatment under the terms of the awards notwithstanding that he was younger than 55 years old however the vesting of the awards was not accelerated on his retirement and no changes were made to the fullterm expiration dates or the strike prices of the awards the 415 million  or 209  increase in other overhead costs included increased spending related to strategic initiatives 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    sga expenses for fiscal 2015 were reduced by 209 million or 006 per share which represented our receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit related to the economic loss associated with certain toyota vehicles excluding this litigation settlement the fiscal 2016 increase reflected the 10 growth in our store base representing the addition of 14 stores and higher information technology and marketing costs this was partially offset by a 233 million decrease in sharebased compensation expense which was influenced by decreases in the per share price of our common stock during fiscal 2016 the decrease in sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2016 reduced sga per used unit by 38 

interest expense 

interest expense includes the interest related to short and longterm debt and finance and capital lease obligations it does not include interest on the nonrecourse notes payable which is reflected within caf income 

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    interest expense increased to 564 million  in fiscal 2017  versus 364 million  in fiscal 2016  the increase reflected the combination of planned higher outstanding debt levels in fiscal 2017  as part of our capital structure strategy as well as growth in our finance and capital lease obligations see “financial condition – liquidity and capital resources” for further discussion during fiscal 2017 we sold 500 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2023 2026 and 2028 to investors in a private placement 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    interest expense increased to 364 million  in fiscal 2016  versus 245 million  in fiscal 2015  primarily reflecting our higher average outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2016  as a result of borrowings to fund our stock repurchase activity we moved closer to our target range for adjusted debt to capital ratio 

other expense 

during fiscal 2016  we recorded a onetime charge of 83 million associated with a property that is no longer planned to be used

caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses 

  

caf’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multiyear period we strive to originate loans with an underlying risk profile that we believe will in the aggregate and excluding caf’s tier 3 originations result in cumulative net losses in the 2 to 25 range over the life of the loans actual loss performance of the loans may fall outside of this range based on various factors including intentional changes in the risk profile of originations economic conditions and wholesale recovery rates current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business including the volume of loans originated current interest rates charged to consumers loan terms and average credit scores because we recognize caf income over the life of the underlying auto loan loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period’s financial results

fiscal 2017  versus fiscal 2016    caf income declined 59  in fiscal 2017  the decline was due to an increase in the provision for loan losses and lower total interest margin percentage partially offset by the increase in average managed receivables average managed receivables grew 117  to 1016 billion  in fiscal 2017  driven by the rise in caf loan originations in recent years the growth in net loan originations in fiscal 2017  resulted from our used vehicle sales growth and an increase in cafs penetration rate that was caused by the increased mix of credit applications from customers at the higher end of the credit spectrum 

the total interest margin which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs declined to 58  of average managed receivables from 61  in fiscal 2016  this was the result of a gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to consumers and our funding costs in recent years funding costs have increased modestly due to overall market changes while our rates charged to consumers remained stable changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time continued increases in interest rates which affect caf’s funding costs or other competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations 

the provision for loan losses rose to 1506 million  in fiscal 2017  from 1012 million  in fiscal 2016  due to unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017  as well as the growth in managed receivables while higher loss rates were primarily due to an increase in chargeoffs lower recovery rates also contributed to the unfavorable loss experience in fiscal 2017  which we believe reflects conditions impacting our industry as a whole the increase in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed 

receivables reflected the effect of the change in loss and delinquency experience on our outlook for net losses expected to occur over the next 12 months 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    caf income rose 67  to 3920 million  in fiscal 2016  driven by the growth in average managed receivables partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage and an increase in the provision for loan losses average managed receivables grew 157  to 909 billion  in fiscal 2016  driven by the rise in net loan originations in recent years net loans originated in fiscal 2016  increased 94  primarily reflecting the 66  growth in used vehicle revenues and a higher caf penetration rate the increase in caf’s penetration rate in fiscal 2016  was largely due to changes in the underlying credit mix of customers applying for financing 

  

the total interest margin declined to 61  of average managed receivables from 65  in fiscal 2015  this was the result of a gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to consumers and our funding costs in recent years 

the provision for loan losses rose 229  to 1012 million  in fiscal 2016  reflecting the 157  increase in average managed receivables in fiscal 2016  and the effect of favorable loss experience in fiscal 2015  which reduced the provision in that year the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables remained consistent at 099  as of february 29 2016  versus 097  as of february 28 2015  

tier 3 loan originations   caf also originates a small portion of auto loans to customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers in order to better understand the performance of these loans mitigate risk and add incremental profits caf currently targets originating approximately 5 of the total tier 3 loan volume however this rate may vary over time based on market conditions a total of 1233 million and 965 million in caf tier 3 receivables were outstanding as of february 28 2017  and february 29 2016  respectively these loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the caf portfolio as well as higher contract rates as of february 28 2017  and february 29 2016  approximately 10 of the total allowance for loan losses related to the outstanding caf tier 3 loan balances during fiscal 2017 we entered into a new 100 million warehouse facility that is being used to fund a portion of caf’s tier 3 loan origination activity previously these loans had been funded separately from the remainder of caf’s portfolio using existing working capital 

planned future activities 

  

we currently plan to open 15  stores in fiscal 2018  and between 13  and 16  stores in fiscal 2019  we will be entering five new television markets and expanding our presence in seven existing television markets of the 15  stores we plan to open in fiscal 2018  6 are in metropolitan statistical areas “msas” having populations of 600000 or less which we define as small markets we currently estimate capital expenditures will total   approximately   325 million   in fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017  the decrease in planned capital spending primarily reflects reduced spending on construction and land acquisitions resulting from changes in the mix of markets in which stores are being built

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations store expansion   and improvement and caf since fiscal 2013 we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facility   or through other financing sources 

we currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35 to 45 in calculating this ratio we utilize total debt excluding nonrecourse notes payable a multiple of 8 times rent expense and total shareholders’ equity we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources together with stock repurchases to achieve and maintain this targeted ratio however in any period we may be outside this range due to seasonal market strategic or other factors 

  

operating activities  during fiscal 2017  net cash used in operating activities totaled 4681 million  compared with 1489 million  in fiscal 2016  the net cash used in operating activities includes increases in auto loan receivables of 121 billion  in fiscal 2017  and 120 billion  in fiscal 2016  the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities 

as of february 28 2017  total inventory was 226 billion  representing an increase of 3285 million  or 170  compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year the increase primarily reflected the addition of inventory to support new store openings and our comparable store sales growth in fiscal 2017  increased inventory levels were also a result of delays in federal income tax refunds that impacted the timing of anticipated sales in february these increases were partially offset by a decline in the average carrying cost of inventory due to changes in acquisition costs 

as of february 29 2016  total inventory was 193 billion  representing a decrease of 1548   million or   74 compared with the balance as of the start of fiscal 2016    the decrease primarily reflected the net effects of i a 13 decrease in used vehicles in inventory at stores included in the comparable store base in an effort to optimize inventory ii the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2016  and iii our disposal of two new car franchises during fiscal 2016  

when considering cash provided by operating activities management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in nonrecourse notes payable this is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were funded through the issuance of nonrecourse notes payable during the year the resulting financial measure adjusted net cash from operating activities is a nongaap financial measure we believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations including the increases in nonrecourse notes payable net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows 

  

r econciliation of a djusted n et c ash from o perating a ctivities 

    

   

adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017  decreased compared to fiscal 2016  primarily due to the change in inventory during fiscal 2017  partially offset by the timing of payments related to operating payables and an increase in net income when excluding noncash expenses which include depreciation and amortization sharebased compensation expense and the provisions for loan losses and cancellation reserves in addition the increase in net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable was primarily attributable to loan origination growth as well as the new warehouse facility being used to fund certain of caf’s tier 3 loans in fiscal 2016  all of cafs tier 3 loans were funded through the use of existing working capital 

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities totaled 4656 million  in fiscal 2017  3788 million  in fiscal 2016  and 3607 million  in fiscal 2015  investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled   4181 million  in fiscal 2017  3156 million  in fiscal 2016  and   3098 million  in fiscal 2015  capital expenditures primarily include store construction costs real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store remodeling expenses we maintain a multiyear pipeline of sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years   we opened 15  stores in fiscal 2017  we opened 14  stores and relocated 1 store in fiscal 2016  and we opened 13  stores in fiscal 2015  the increase in capital expenditures in the current year period largely reflected timing changes in the purchases of land and related construction activity for future stores 

  

financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities totaled 9347 million  in fiscal 2017  5375 million  in fiscal 2016  and 7286 million  in fiscal 2015  included in these amounts were net increases in total nonrecourse notes payable of   121 billion  106 billion  and 122 billion  respectively which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of 121 billion  120 billion  and 137 billion  respectively in auto loan receivables see operating activities during fiscal 2017  we sold 500 million  of senior unsecured notes in a private placement and used a portion of the proceeds to reduce net borrowings under our revolving credit facility during fiscal 2016  we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by 4046 million  during fiscal 2015  we received proceeds of 300 million from a variablerate term loan entered into in november 2014 net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of   5643 million  in fiscal 2017  9839 million  in fiscal 2016   and 9243 million   in fiscal 2015  

t otal d ebt and c ash and c ash e quivalents 

 

we have a 120 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in august 2020  borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us we also have a 300 million  variablerate term loan which is due in august 2020  in addition we have 500 million of fixedrate senior unsecured notes which are due in 2023 2026 and 2028 the credit facility term loan and senior note agreements contain representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements were not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity 

finance and capital lease obligations relate primarily to stores subject to saleleaseback transactions that did not qualify for sale accounting and therefore are accounted for as financings payments on the leases are recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the obligations in the event the leases are modified or extended beyond their original lease term the related obligation is increased based on the present value of the revised future minimum lease payments with a corresponding increase to the assets subject to these transactions upon modification the amortization of the obligation is reset resulting in more of the lease payments being applied to interest expense in the initial years following the modification during fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  finance lease obligations were increased by 800 million  and 1032 million respectively related to leases that were modified or extended beyond their original lease term resulting in an increase of interest expense recognized in fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  that is expected to continue in fiscal 2018  

see note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility term loan senior notes and finance and capital lease obligations 

caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through our warehouse facilities and term securitization transactions our funding vehicles are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our funding vehicles even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the related receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these funding vehicles loans originated in the caf tier 3 loan origination program are primarily being funded through a 100 million  warehouse facility as well as the use of existing working capital 

the timing of principal payments on the nonrecourse notes payable is based on the timing of principal collections and defaults on the related auto loan receivables the current portion of nonrecourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period 

as of february 28 2017  912 billion  of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations these notes payable have scheduled maturities through july 2023  but they may mature earlier depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables during fiscal 2017  we completed four  term securitizations funding a total of 503 billion  of auto loan receivables 

as of february 28 2017  162 billion  of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time as our store base sales and caf loan originations have grown in fiscal 2017  we increased the combined limit of our warehouse facilities by 300 million as of february 28 2017  the combined warehouse facility limit was 280 billion  and the unused warehouse capacity totaled 118 billion  of the combined warehouse facility limit 130 billion  will expire in august 2017  and 150 billion  will expire in february 2018  see notes 2f and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

the agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to fund receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the related receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

we expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations borrowings under existing new or expanded credit facilities and other funding arrangements will be sufficient to fund caf capital expenditures repurchases of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements 

the timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on share price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock as of february 28 2017  the board had authorized a total of 455 billion  of repurchases at that date 159 billion  was available for repurchase under the board’s outstanding authorizations which includes an additional 750 million  authorized during fiscal 2017 also during fiscal 2017 the board removed the expiration date of the outstanding repurchase authorizations see note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

auto loan receivables 

as of february 28 2017  and february 29 2016  all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved primarily through asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and variablerate notes our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies other receivables are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities

interest rate exposure 

we have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility substantially all of these borrowings are variablerate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2017  net earnings per share by less than 001  we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our term loan however the variablerate risk is mitigated by a derivative instrument this derivative instrument will expire in november 2017 which could result in additional interest rate exposure in future periods 

borrowings under our warehouse facilities are also variablerate debt and are secured by auto loan receivables on which we collect interest at fixed rates the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement this variablerate risk is mitigated by funding the receivables through a term securitization or other funding arrangement and by entering into derivative instruments absent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk a 100basis point increase in market interest rates associated with the warehouse facilities would have decreased our fiscal 2017  net earnings per share by approximately 005  

  

other market exposures 

our pension plan has interest rate risk related to its projected benefit obligation pbo due to the relatively young overall age of the plan’s participants a 100basis point change in the discount rate has approximately a 20  effect on the pbo balance a 100basis point decrease in the discount rate would have decreased our fiscal 2017  net earnings per share by less than 001  see note 10 for more information on our benefit plans 

  

as our cashsettled restricted stock units are liability awards the related compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the company’s stock price the marktomarket effect on the liability depends on each award’s grant price and previously recognized expense at february 28 2017  a 100 change in the company’s stock price would have affected fiscal 2017  net earnings per share by less than 001

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background 

carmax inc seeks to deliver an unrivaled customer experience by offering a broad selection of high quality used vehicles and related products and services at low nohaggle prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility our strategy is to revolutionize the used auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers by focusing on customer service associate development and efficient execution we have become the nation’s largest retailer of used cars selling 619936  used vehicles at retail during the fiscal year ended february 29 2016  in addition we are one of the nation’s largest operators of wholesale vehicle auctions and one of the nation’s largest providers of used vehicle financing 

carmax was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax store in richmond virginia on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company as of february 29 2016  we operated 158  used car stores in 78  metropolitan markets our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

carmax business 

we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations     our carmax sales operations segment sells used vehicles purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources sells related products and services and arranges financing options for customers all for fixed nohaggle prices we enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer 

purchasing a vehicle  

the vehicle purchase process in a carmax store differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience our nohaggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers in addition our sales consultants are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate this pay structure aligns our sales associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

we recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our carmax quality certified standards and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale we stand behind every used vehicle we sell with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty 

we maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory of more than 55000  vehicles as of february 29 2016  available for viewing on our website carmaxcom as well as our mobile app upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in this inventory to a local store this allows a single carmax store to offer access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer in fiscal 2016  approximately 30  of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request 

in addition to retailing used vehicles we sell new vehicles at two  locations under franchise agreements 

selling us a vehicle  

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a customer’s vehicle free of charge and make a written guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us this nohaggle offer is good for seven days 

based on their age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through our instore appraisal process meet our retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers as of february 29 2016  we conducted wholesale auctions at 67  of our 158  stores during fiscal 2016  we sold 394437  wholesale vehicles through these onsite auctions with an average auction sales rate of 97  

financing a vehicle  

the availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process and having an array of finance sources increases approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax our finance program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both caf and thirdparty providers we believe that our processes and systems transparency of pricing and vehicle quality as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit allow caf and our thirdparty providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment all finance offers whether from caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3‑day payoff option which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge 

related products and services  

we provide customers with a range of other related products and services including extended protection plan “epp” products and vehicle repair service epp products include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” which is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business in fiscal 2016  more than 60  of the customers who purchased a retail used vehicle also purchased an esp and approximately 25  purchased gap 

carmax auto finance     caf provides financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide customers with a competitive financing option caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely through carmax stores our scoring models are optimized for the carmax channel we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 428  of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2016  

caf also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements collecting payments maintaining contact with delinquent customers and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans as of february 29 2016  caf serviced approximately 709000  customer accounts in its 959 billion  portfolio of managed receivables 

competition 

carmax sales operations   the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and we face competition from franchised dealers who sell both new and used vehicles independent used car dealers online and mobile sales platforms and private parties according to industry sources as of december 31 2015  there were approximately 18000  franchised dealers in the us and we believe there were approximately two times as many independent dealers our primary retail competitors are franchised auto dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles competition in our industry is increasingly affected by the use of internetbased marketing and other internetbased tools for both consumers and the dealers with whom we compete 

based on industry data there were approximately 40 million  used cars sold in the us in calendar 2015  of which approximately 22 million  were estimated to be 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us in calendar 2015  we sold approximately 5  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the markets in which we operate and less than 3  of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold nationwide 

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our low nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on site and via carmaxcom and our mobile app the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems the transparency and availability of caf and thirdparty financing and the locations of our retail stores in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our high volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards 

our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast to the highly fragmented used vehicle retail market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc which together represent an estimated 70  of the north american wholesale car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax’s auctions predominantly sell older higher mileage vehicles 

carmax auto finance  caf operates in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies according to industry sources this sector represented nearly 1 trillion  in outstanding receivables as of december 31 2015  caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars for loans originated during the calendar quarter ended december 31 2015  industry sources ranked caf 8 th in market share for used vehicle loans and 14 th in market share for all vehicle loans 

we believe that caf’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source in carmax stores and that caf’s primary driver for growth is the growth in carmax’s retail used unit sales we periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness we also monitor 3day payoffs as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our offer 

products and services 

retail merchandising   we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old these vehicles generally range in price from 12000 to 35000 the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences seasonality and market availability 

wholesale auctions   the typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase our auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis 

  

extended protection plans   at the time of sale we offer customers epp products we receive revenue for selling these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors we have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract all epps that we sell other than manufacturer programs on new car sales have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements periodically we may receive additional revenue based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products 

reconditioning and service   an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our standards before it can become a carmax quality certified vehicle this process includes a comprehensive carmax quality inspection of the engine and all major systems based on this inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our quality standards many of our stores depend upon nearby typically larger carmax stores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services including but not limited to services related to manufacturer’s warranties we engage third parties specializing in those services 

in addition all carmax used car stores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by the esps we sell 

customer credit  we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and arrangements with several financial institutions vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicle as of february 29 2016  our thirdparty finance providers included santander consumer usa wells fargo dealer services ally financial inc exeter finance corp american credit acceptance capital one auto finance and westlake financial services we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers and periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

all credit applications submitted by customers at carmax stores are initially reviewed by caf applications that are declined or conditionally approved by caf are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we refer to the providers who pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as tier 3 providers we are willing to pay a fee to tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that 

they may not otherwise be able to obtain all fees either received or paid are prenegotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount financed the interest rate the term of the loan or the loantovalue ratio caf also provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a tier 3 provider 

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

suppliers for used vehicles 

we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process as well as through local regional and online auctions we also to a lesser extent acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market 

the supply of latemodel used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the rate of new vehicle sales which in turn generate used car tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry sources there were approximately 260 million  light vehicles in operation in the us as of december 31 2015  during calendar year 2015  over 17 million  new cars and 40 million  used cars were sold at retail many of which were accompanied by tradeins and nearly 10 million  vehicles were sold at wholesale auctions 

based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year consumer acceptance of our instore appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

seasonality 

historically our business has been seasonal our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter we typically experience an increase in traffic and sales in february and march coinciding with tax refund season 

systems 

our stores are supported by proprietary information systems that improve the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions including our credit processing information system our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity 

our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location leveraging our more than twenty years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles our system generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that take into account factors that include sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

marketing and advertising 

our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmaxcom and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle we implement these strategies through both traditional and digital methods including social media our carmaxcom website and related mobile apps are marketing tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to initiate part of the shopping and sales process online the website and mobile apps also include a variety of other customer service features including initiation of vehicle transfers and scheduling appointments information on the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated several times per day our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2016  approximately 88  of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online 

associates 

on february 29 2016  we had a total of 22429  full and parttime associates including 16557  hourly and salaried associates and 5872  sales associates who worked on a commission basis we employ additional associates during peak selling seasons we believe we have created a unique corporate culture and maintain good employee relations no associate is subject to a collective 

bargaining agreement we focus on developing our associates and providing them with the information and resources they need to offer exceptional customer service and have been recognized for the success of our efforts by a number of external organizations 

intellectual property 

our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy our principal trademarks including carmax and the related family of marks have been registered with the us patent and trademark office

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business sales results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

we operate in a highly competitive   industry failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation’s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles could adversely affect   our business sales and results of operations 

  

automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers and online and mobile sales platforms as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices new car dealers in particular including publiclytraded auto retailers have increased their sales of used vehicles in recent years these new car dealers also leverage their franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers to brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax 

some of our competitors have announced plans for rapid expansion including into markets with carmax locations and some of them have begun to execute those plans some of our competitors have also replicated or attempted to replicate portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car store in 1993 including our use of low nohaggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer’s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us 

the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles and to provide vehicle financing could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations the increasing online availability of used vehicle information including pricing information could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines and online classified sites that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmaxcom to attract traffic these companies could also make it more difficult for carmax to otherwise market its vehicles online 

the increasing use of the internet to facilitate consumers’ sales or tradeins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations for example certain websites provide online appraisal tools to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than carmax 

in addition to the direct competition and increasing use of the internet described above there are companies that sell software solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to among other things more efficiently source and price inventory although these companies do not compete with carmax the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with carmax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of carmax’s internally developed proprietary systems 

if we fail to respond effectively to competitive pressures or to changes in the used vehicle marketplace it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our caf segment is subject to competition from various financial institutions including banks and credit unions which provide vehicle financing to consumers if we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our thirdparty financing providers which financings are generally less profitable to carmax in addition we believe that caf allows us to capture additional sales accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance offers to our customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

carmax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our   business sales and results of operations 

our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and could involve among other things our sales process our provision 

of financing our reconditioning process or our treatment of customers even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results 

the growing use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected we monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns provide accurate information and protect our reputation but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions these conditions could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to national and regional us economic conditions these conditions include but are not limited to recession inflation interest rates unemployment levels the state of the housing market gasoline prices consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general these conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as acts of terrorism when these economic conditions worsen or stagnate it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally including the used vehicles that we sell and the availability of consumer credit to finance vehicle purchases this could result in lower sales decreased margins on units sold and decreased profits for our caf segment worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of latemodel used vehicles as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time this could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold 

  

any significant change or deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business is dependent upon capital to fund growth and to support the activities of our caf   segment changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our   business sales results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support our geographic expansion could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth although internally generated cash flows have recently been sufficient to fund geographic expansion there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows sufficient to fund growth failure to do so—or our decision to put our cash to other uses—would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our geographic expansion 

changes in the availability or cost of the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loan receivables through caf could adversely affect sales and results of operations we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions—especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows—could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on thirdparty financing providers to finance a significant portion of our customers’ vehicle purchases accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties 

we provide financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty financing providers if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide financing to our customers provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally 

if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers to supply epp products to our customers accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these thirdparties 

we receive revenue for selling epp products on behalf of unrelated thirdparties who are the primary obligors the third parties that provide esps are the warranty group cna national warranty corporation and fidelity warranty services the third party that provides gap products is safeguard products international llc if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide epp products make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our   more than 22000 associates 

  

our associates are the driving force behind our success we believe that one of the things that sets carmax apart is a culture centered on valuing all associates in addition our strategic initiatives require management employees and contractors to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities our failure to maintain this culture or to continue recruiting developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates our growth plans changes in employment legislation and competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and for qualified service technicians in particular our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is also subject to our ability to maintain positive associate relations if we are unable to do so or if despite our efforts we become subject to successful unionization efforts it could increase costs limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our success also depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers a breach of this confidentiality whether due to a cybersecurity or other incident could result in harm to our customers and damage to our brand 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers this information includes the information customers provide when purchasing a vehicle and applying for vehicle financing we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential associate information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers although we have taken measures designed to safeguard such information and have received assurances from our thirdparty providers our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty providers could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events numerous national retailers have disclosed security breaches involving sophisticated cyberattacks that were not recognized or detected until after such retailers had been affected notwithstanding the preventive measures such retailers had in place any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or associate information whether experienced by us or by our thirdparty service providers and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident a programming error or other cause could damage our reputation expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement disrupt our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to such a security breach could exacerbate the consequences of the breach 

our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles 

any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for example if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap in addition any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins 

our business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory obstacles to acquiring inventory—whether because of supply competition or other factors—or a failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations although the supply of latemodel used vehicles has been increasing there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that it will benefit carmax 

we source a significant percentage of our vehicles though our appraisal process and these vehicles are generally more profitable for carmax accordingly if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or fail to recognize those trends it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory it could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from thirdparty auctions which is generally less profitable for carmax our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition both from new and used car dealers directly and through thirdparty websites driving appraisal traffic to those dealers see the risk factor above titled “ we operate in a highly competitive   industry ” for discussion of this risk our ability to source vehicles from thirdparty auctions could be affected by an increase in the number of closed auctions that are open only to new car dealers who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers 

used vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk accordingly if we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations changes in these laws and regulations or our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations our sale of used vehicles is subject to state and local licensing requirements federal and state laws regulating vehicle advertising and state laws regulating vehicle sales and service our provision of vehicle financing is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies and large employers generally including federal employment practices securities and tax laws for additional discussion of these laws and regulations see the section of this form 10k titled “ business –  laws and regulations ” 

the violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against our business operations any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations 

recent federal legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms may result in an increase in expenses or a decrease in revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” regulates among other things the provision of consumer financing the doddfrank act established a new federal agency the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” with broad regulatory powers over consumer financial products and activities in august 2015 the cfpb’s supervisory authority over large nonbank auto finance companies including carmax’s caf segment became effective we expect that the cfpb will use this authority to conduct supervisory examinations of nonbank auto finance companies to ensure compliance with various federal consumer protection laws the evolving regulatory environment in the wake of the continued implementation of the doddfrank act and the expansion of the cfpb’s authority may increase the cost of regulatory compliance or result in changes to business practices that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

current federal labor policy could lead to increased unionization efforts which could increase labor costs disrupt store operations and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities continue to scrutinize advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced see the risk factor titled “ we operate in a highly competitive   industry ” for discussion of this risk 

we are a growth retailer our failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business sales   and results of operations 

our business strategy includes opening stores in new and existing markets and implementing new initiatives to elevate the experience of our customers the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our information systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations the expansion of our store base and implementation of new initiatives also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion see the risk factor above titled “ our success depends upon the   continued contributions of our more than   22000   associates ” for discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base also requires real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are forced to curtail or stop growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated information systems to run our business the failure of these systems or the inability to enhance our capabilities   could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to manage sales inventory our customerfacing websites and applications carmaxcom carmax mobile apps and carmaxauctionscom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary or the inability to enhance our information technology capabilities could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

in addition despite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems we could be subjected to attacks by hackers including denialofservice attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations see the risk factor above titled “ we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers ” for the risks associated with a breach of confidential customer or associate information 

we are subject to numerous legal proceedings if the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to carmax it could   have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various litigation matters from time to time which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these claims could be asserted under a variety of laws including but not limited to consumer finance laws consumer protection laws intellectual property laws privacy laws labor and employment laws securities laws and employee benefit laws these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers including manufacturer recalls 

adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles including the supply of latemodel used vehicles in addition manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have accelerated in frequency and scope in recent years recalls could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicles which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates as well as changes in accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of carmax’s assets liabilities revenues expenses and earnings if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

the implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 

we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

our business is sensitive to weather events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

we are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated 

our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us california texas and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we generally conduct our retail vehicle operations in two formats – production and nonproduction stores production stores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production stores have more service bays and require additional space for reconditioning activities and therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction store on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some stores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction stores until we expand our presence in that market as of february 29 2016  we operated 85  production stores and 73  nonproduction stores production stores are generally on 10  to 25  acres but a few range from 25  to 35  acres and nonproduction stores are generally on 4  to 12  acres 

we have recently incorporated small format stores into our future store opening plans these stores are located in smaller markets or areas where the sales opportunity is below that of midsized and large markets they are generally located on 3  to 7  acres although small format stores with production capabilities may be somewhat larger as of february 29 2016  we had 10  small format stores 

as of february 29 2016  we operated 67  wholesale auctions most of which were located at production stores stores at which auctions are conducted generally have additional space to store wholesale inventory

expansion 

since opening our first used car store in 1993 we have grown organically through the construction and opening of companyoperated stores we do not franchise our operations as of february 29 2016  we operated in 78  us markets which covered approximately 65  of the us population we believe that further geographic expansion and additional fillin opportunities in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2017  we plan to open 15  stores in fiscal 2018 we plan to open between 13  and 16  stores

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation all references to net earnings per share are to diluted net earnings per share amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding 

overview 

see part i item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company’s business 

  

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying vehicles from carmax 

carmax sales operations 

our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services such as wholesale vehicle sales the sale of extended protection plan “epp” products which include extended service plans “esps” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” and vehicle repair service gap is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft we focus on addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers while maximizing operating efficiencies we offer low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles valueadded epp products and superior customer service 

our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us and availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the sales process we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with industryleading thirdparty finance providers all of the finance offers whether by caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff option 

as of february 29 2016  we operated 158  used car stores in 78  markets covering 50  midsized markets 22  large markets and 6  small markets we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000  and 3 million  people as of that date we also conducted wholesale auctions at 67  used car stores and we operated 2  new car franchises 

carmax auto finance 

in addition to thirdparty financing providers we provide vehicle financing through caf which offers financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty financing providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option as a result we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 428  of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2016  as of february 29 2016  caf serviced approximately 709000  customer accounts in its 959 billion  portfolio of managed receivables 

management regularly analyzes caf’s operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer profitability the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses 

revenues and profitability 

during fiscal 2016  net sales and operating revenues increased 62  net earnings grew 44 and net earnings per share increased 110 fiscal 2015 results were impacted by a benefit of 129 million net of tax or 006 per share related to the receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit 

our primary source of revenue and net income is the retail sale of used vehicles during fiscal 2016  we sold 619936  used cars representing 821  of our net sales and operating revenues and 663  of our gross profit used vehicle unit sales grew 65  including a 24  increase in comparable store used units and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base used vehicle gross profits increased 55  due to the increase in unit sales partially offset by a modest reduction in used vehicle gross profit per unit 

wholesale sales are also a significant contributor to our revenues and net income during fiscal 2016  we sold 394437  wholesale vehicles representing 144  of our net sales and operating revenues and 192  of our gross profit wholesale vehicle unit sales 

grew 49  primarily reflecting the growth in our store base wholesale vehicle gross profits increased 64  due to the combination of the increase in unit sales and a modest increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit 

during fiscal 2016  other sales and revenues which include revenue earned on the sale of epp products net thirdparty finance fees and new car and service department sales represented 34  of our net sales and operating revenues and 145  of our gross profit other sales and revenues declined 42  primarily due to our disposal of two of the four new car franchises we owned at the start of fiscal 2016 other gross profit increased 149  reflecting the combination of improved epp revenues and net thirdparty finance fees as well as the benefit related to the change in timing of our recognition of reconditioning overhead costs these costs which previously had been expensed as incurred are now allocated to the carrying cost of inventory 

income from our caf segment totaled 3920 million  in fiscal 2016  up 67  compared with fiscal 2015  caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs 

liquidity 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from securitization transactions and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other financing sources during fiscal 2016  liquidity was primarily provided by 9082 million  of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities a nongaap measure which included 106 billion  in net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable and by net borrowings of 4046 million  under our revolving credit facility this liquidity was primarily used to fund the 163 million  common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program our store growth and the increase in caf auto loan receivables 

when considering cash provided by operating activities management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been securitized with nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities for a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities to net cash used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure see “reconciliation of adjusted net cash from operating activities” included in “financial condition – liquidity and capital resources” 

future outlook 

over the long term we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base we also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and over time increased caf income to expand our vehicle unit sales at new and existing stores we will need to continue delivering an unrivaled customer experience and hiring and developing the associates necessary to drive our success while managing the risks posed by an evolving competitive environment in addition to support our store growth plans we will need to continue procuring suitable real estate at favorable terms 

we are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 29 2016  we had used car stores located in markets that represented approximately 65  of the us population during fiscal 2016  we opened 14  stores and relocated 1 store whose lease was set to expire in fiscal 2017  we plan to open 15  stores in fiscal 2018 we plan to open between 13  and 16  stores for a detailed list of stores we plan to open in fiscal 2017 see the table included in “planned future activities” 

for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company see “risk factors” included in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving securitization program composed of two warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding 

arrangement we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations as secured borrowings which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses 

auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through caf the receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance 

see notes 2f 2i and 4 for additional information on securitizations and auto loan receivables 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5‑day moneyback guarantee we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors to customers who purchase a vehicle the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract we recognize revenue at the time of sale net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations periodically we may receive additional revenue based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products these additional amounts are recognized as revenue when received the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience recent trends and credit mix of the customer base our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the revenue that we receive cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of esp and gap sales customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates a 10 change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately 110 million as of february 29 2016  see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves 

customers applying for financing who are not approved by caf may be evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we recognize these fees at the time of sale 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted see note 9 for additional information on income taxes 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider available loss carrybacks tax planning strategies future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 29 2016  will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us federal and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination

during fiscal 2016  we opened 14 stores including 7 stores in 5 new markets 2 stores each in boston and minneapolis and 1 store each in bloomington gainesville and tallahassee and 7 stores in 6 existing markets 2 stores in denver and 1 store each in atlanta houston philadelphia providence and st louis 

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015  the 66  increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2016 resulted from a 65  increase in unit sales the increase in used unit sales included a 24  increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit sales performance was driven by improved conversion partially offset by a decrease in store traffic we believe that various market factors including but not limited to the availability and relative valuations of certain used vehicle inventories and new vehicle lease and price promotions may have contributed to the decrease in store traffic our data indicates that in our markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by approximately 1 in calendar 2015 

fiscal 2015  versus fiscal 2014   the 133  increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted from a 105  increase in used unit sales and a 25  increase in average retail vehicle selling price the increase in used unit sales included a 44  increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit growth reflected improved customer traffic as well as improved conversion our data indicates that in our markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by approximately 5 in calendar 2014 

the increase in average retail vehicle selling price primarily reflected changes in our sales mix with an increased mix of 0 to 4year old vehicles in fiscal 2015 from 2008 through 2012 new car industry sales were at rates significantly below prerecession levels which affected the overall supply and acquisition costs of latemodel used vehicles as the supply of latermodel used vehicles has gradually improved our inventory mix has shifted accordingly 

wholesale vehicle sales 

our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles bought through our appraisal process and sold in our auctions 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    the 68  increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2016 resulted from a 49  increase in wholesale unit sales and a 10  increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price the wholesale unit growth primarily reflected the growth in our store base 

fiscal 2015  versus fiscal 2014    the 124  increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted from a 98  increase in wholesale unit sales and a 22  increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price the wholesale unit growth reflected both an increase in the appraisal buy rate and the growth in our store base 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include revenue from the sale of esps and gap collectively reported in epp revenues net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues starting in fiscal 2016 new car sales are also included as a component of other revenues along with service department sales we refer to the thirdparty finance providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as tier 2 providers and we refer to the providers to whom we pay a fee as tier 3 providers the fees we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers the mix of our retail vehicles financed by caf tier 2 and tier 3 providers may vary from quarter to quarter depending on several factors including the credit quality of applicants changes in providers’ credit decisioning and external market conditions changes in originations by one tier of credit providers may also affect the originations made by providers in other tiers 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015  other sales and revenues declined 42  in fiscal 2016 primarily due to our disposal of two of the four new car franchises we owned at the start of fiscal 2016 epp revenue increased 47  largely reflecting the growth in our used unit sales net thirdparty finance fees improved by 35  primarily due to shifts in the mix among finance providers vehicles financed by the tier 3 providers and vehicles included in the caf tier 3 loan origination program represented 144 of retail used unit sales in fiscal 2016 versus 158 in fiscal 2015 

fiscal 2015  versus fiscal 2014    other sales and revenues increased 226 primarily due to the 105 increase in used units sold the 224 increase in epp revenues was due to the increase in used unit sales as well as prior year’s epp cancellation reserve correction that reduced fiscal 2014 epp revenues net thirdparty finance fees improved 230  primarily due to a mix shift among providers including an increase in the percentage of our used unit sales financed by the tier 2 providers and a reduction in the percentage financed by the tier 3 providers the percentage of retail used vehicles financed by tier 3 providers combined with those financed under the caf tier 3 loan origination program was 158 in fiscal 2015 compared with 191 in fiscal 2014 other revenue increases were primarily the result of increases in new vehicle revenues due to increases in unit sales 

during fiscal 2014 we corrected our accounting related to cancellation reserves for esp and gap with resulting increases in reserves related to activity for fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 the portion of the correction recorded in fiscal 2014 that related to earlier fiscal years was 195 million or 005 per share

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and 

the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit 

we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015   the 55  increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by the 65  growth in total used unit sales partially offset by a modest decline in used gross profit per unit 

fiscal 2015  versus fiscal 2014    the 109  increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2015 was driven by the corresponding increase in used unit sales used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015  the 64   increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2016 reflected the combination of the 49  increase in wholesale unit sales with a 14  increase in wholesale gross profit per unit 

fiscal 2015  versus fiscal 2014    the 163 increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2015 reflected the combination of the 98  increase in wholesale unit sales with a 54 increase in wholesale gross profit per unit 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues net thirdparty finance fees and other revenues which are comprised of new car sales and service department operations including used vehicle reconditioning we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent revenues paid to us by certain thirdparty providers thirdparty finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to thirdparty tier 3 finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015  other gross profit rose 149  in fiscal 2016  primarily reflecting the improvement in epp revenues and net thirdparty finance fees discussed above as well as an increase in service department gross profits due to a change in the timing of our recognition of reconditioning overhead costs which increased other gross profit in fiscal 2016 by 104 million these costs which previously had been expensed as incurred are now allocated to the carrying cost of inventory 

fiscal 2015  versus fiscal 2014    other gross profit increased 331 primarily due to the epp cancellation reserve correction that reduced fiscal 2014 gross profit excluding this correction gross profit increased consistent with the changes in other sales and revenues discussed above 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not had a significant impact on results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices however changes in average vehicle selling prices impact caf income to the extent the average amount financed also changes 

in the years following the recession we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing we believe the appreciation resulted in part from a reduced supply of latemodel used vehicles in the market this reduced supply was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle tradein activity compared with prerecession periods the higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our used vehicle average selling prices which climbed from 16291 in fiscal 2009 to 19917  in fiscal 2016 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses 

  

c omponents of sga e xpenses 

   

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015  sga expenses for fiscal 2015 were reduced by 209 million or 006 per share which represented our receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit related to the economic loss associated with certain toyota vehicles excluding this litigation settlement the fiscal 2016 increase reflected the 10 growth in our store base representing the addition of 14 stores and higher information technology and marketing costs this was partially offset by a 233 million decrease in sharebased compensation expense which was influenced by decreases in the per share price of our common stock during fiscal 2016 the decrease in sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2016 reduced sga per used unit by 38 

fiscal 2015  versus fiscal 2014   excluding the litigation settlement received in fiscal 2015 sga expenses grew reflecting the combination of several factors including the 10 increase in our store base during fiscal 2015 representing the addition of 13 stores higher variable selling costs resulting from the 44 increase in comparable store used unit sales and an 115 million increase in sharebased compensation expense which was influenced by the 1868 increase in the per share price of our common stock during fiscal 2015 excluding the settlement gain sga per used unit in fiscal 2015 was similar to fiscal 2014

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    interest expense increased to 364 million  in fiscal 2016 versus 245 million  in fiscal 2015 primarily reflecting our higher average outstanding borrowings during fiscal 2016 as a result of borrowings to fund our stock repurchase activity we moved closer to our target range for adjusted debt to capital ratio see “liquidity and capital resources” for more information 

fiscal 2015  versus fiscal 2014   interest expense declined to 245 million  in fiscal 2015 versus 308 million  in fiscal 2014 during fiscal 2015 we capitalized 89 million in interest costs associated with the construction of certain facilities excluding the capitalized interest costs the yearoveryear increase in interest expense primarily reflected interest expense on a 300 million term loan entered into in november 2014 

other expense 

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015  during fiscal 2016 we recorded a onetime charge of 83 million associated with a property that is no longer planned to be used 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 383 in fiscal 2016  384 in fiscal 2015  and 382 in fiscal 2014  

  

  

results of operations – carmax auto finance 

caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by caf’s portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses 

  

caf’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multiyear period trends in portfolio losses and delinquencies are affected by changes in our origination strategies over time as well as current economic conditions current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business including the volume of loans originated current interest rates charged to consumers loan terms and average credit scores because we recognize caf income over the life of the underlying auto loan loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period’s financial results

fiscal 2016  versus fiscal 2015    caf income rose 67  to 3920 million  in fiscal 2016 driven by the growth in average managed receivables partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage and an increase in the provision for loan losses average managed receivables grew 157  to 909 billion  in fiscal 2016 driven by the rise in net loan originations in recent years net loans originated in fiscal 2016 increased 94  primarily reflecting the 66  growth in used vehicle revenues and a higher caf penetration rate the increase in caf’s penetration rate in fiscal 2016 was largely due to changes in the underlying credit mix of customers applying for financing 

the total interest margin which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs declined to 61  of average managed receivables from 65  in fiscal 2015 this was the result of a gradual compression of the spread between rates charged to consumers and our funding costs in recent years changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time rising interest rates which affect caf’s funding costs or other competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations 

the provision for loan losses rose 229  to 1012 million  in fiscal 2016 reflecting the 157  increase in average managed receivables in fiscal 2016 and the effect of favorable loss experience in fiscal 2015 which reduced the provision in that year the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables remained similar at 099  as of february 29 2016  versus 097  as of february 28 2015  

fiscal 2015  versus fiscal 2014   caf income rose 93  to 3673 million  in fiscal 2015 driven by the growth in average managed receivables partially offset by a lower total interest margin percent average managed receivables grew 186  to 786 billion  in fiscal 2015 net loans originated in fiscal 2015 increased 130  primarily reflecting the 133  growth in used vehicle revenues the increase in caf’s penetration rate in fiscal 2015 included the effect of the increase in loans originated in the caf tier 3 loan origination program 

  

the total interest margin declined to 65  of average managed receivables from 69  in fiscal 2014 this reflected the combination of a gradual decline in the average contract rate charged on new loan originations in recent years with an increase in our average funding costs for more recent securitizations 

the provision for loan losses rose 140  to 823 million  in fiscal 2015 reflecting the 186  increase in average managed receivables partially offset by the effect of favorable loss experience the allowance for loan losses as a percent of ending managed receivables remained consistent at 097  as of both february 28 2015 and february 28 2014 

tier 3 loan originations   in january 2014 caf launched a test originating loans for customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers as of february 29 2016 a total of 965 million receivables were outstanding related to this program we plan to continue to originate loans in the tier 3 space at a share similar to that during the past two years these loans have higher loss and delinquency rates than the remainder of the caf portfolio as well as higher contract rates the program is being funded separately from the remainder of caf’s portfolio using existing working capital and is not included in our current securitization program 

planned future activities 

  

in fiscal 2017  we plan to open 15  stores in fiscal 2018 we plan to open between 13  and 16  stores we currently estimate capital expenditures will total   approximately   450 million   in fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016  the increase in planned capital spending primarily reflects the timing of land acquisitions and construction activity

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations store expansion   and improvement and caf since fiscal 2013 we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facility   or through other financing sources 

we currently target an adjusted debt to capital ratio in a range of 35 to 45 in determining this ratio we utilize total debt excluding nonrecourse notes payable a multiple of rent expense and total shareholders’ equity we expect to use our revolving credit facility and other financing sources together with stock repurchases to achieve this targeted ratio however in any period we may be outside this range due to seasonal market strategic or other factors 

  

operating activities    net cash used in operating activities of 1489 million  in fiscal 2016  includes increases in auto loan receivables of 120 billion  the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities when considering cash provided by operating activities management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in nonrecourse notes payable this is achieved by adding back the cash provided from the net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were securitized through the issuance of nonrecourse notes payable during the year the resulting financial measure adjusted net cash from operating activities is a nongaap financial measure we believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations including the increases in nonrecourse notes payable net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows

as of february 29 2016  total inventory was 193 billion  representing a decrease of 1548 million  or 74  compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year the decrease primarily reflected the net effects of i a 13 decrease in used vehicles in inventory at stores included in the comparable store base in an effort to optimize inventory ii the addition of inventory to support new store openings in fiscal 2016 and iii our disposal of two new car franchises during fiscal 2016 

as of february 28 2015  total inventory was 209 billion  representing an increase of 4455   million or   271 compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year   the increase reflected a combination of factors including an intentional build in inventories in the fall and winter of 2014 to better position us for seasonal sales opportunities the 13 new stores opened during fiscal 2015 added inventories to support our comparable store sales growth and belowtarget inventories at the start of the fiscal year 

  

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities totaled 3788 million  in fiscal 2016  3607 million  in fiscal 2015  and 3367 million  in fiscal 2014  investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled   3156 million  in fiscal 2016  3098 million  in fiscal 2015  and   3103 million  in fiscal 2014  capital expenditures primarily include real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings   store construction costs   and store remodeling expenses we maintain a multiyear pipeline of sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years   we opened 14  stores and relocated 1 store in fiscal 2016  and we opened 13  stores in each of fiscal 2015  and 2014  

  

financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities totaled 5375 million  in fiscal 2016  7286 million  in fiscal 2015  and 113 billion  in fiscal 2014  included in these amounts were net increases in total nonrecourse notes payable of   106 billion  122 billion  and 139 billion  respectively which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of 120 billion  137 billion  and 132 billion  respectively in auto loan receivables see operating activities during fiscal 2016 we increased net borrowings under the revolving credit facility by 4046 million  during fiscal 2015 we received proceeds of 300 million from a variablerate term loan entered into in november 2014 net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of   9839 million  in fiscal 2016  9243 million  in fiscal 2015   and 3134 million   in fiscal 2014  

  

t otal d ebt and c ash and c ash e quivalents 

  

we have a 120 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in august 2020  borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us we also have a 300 million  variablerate term loan which is due in august 2020  the credit facility and term loan agreements contain representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements were not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity 

finance and capital lease obligations relate primarily to stores subject to saleleaseback transactions that did not qualify for sale accounting and are therefore accounted for as financings a portion of the periodic lease payments is recognized as interest expense and the remainder reduces the obligation in the event the leases are modified or extended beyond their original lease term the related obligation is increased based on the present value of the revised future minimum lease payments with a corresponding increase to the assets subject to these transactions upon modification the amortization of the obligation is reset resulting in more of the lease payments being applied to interest expense in the initial years following the modification during fiscal 2016  finance lease obligations were increased by 1032 million  related to leases that were modified or extended beyond their original lease term resulting in an increase of interest expense recognized in fiscal 2016  that is expected to continue in fiscal 2017  

see note 11 for additional information on our revolving credit facility term loan and finance and capital lease obligations 

caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles loans originated in the caf tier 3 loan origination program are currently being funded using existing working capital 

the timing of principal payments on the nonrecourse notes payable is based on the timing of principal collections and defaults on the securitized auto loan receivables the current portion of nonrecourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period 

as of february 29 2016  813 billion  of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations these notes payable have scheduled maturities through august 2022  but they may mature earlier depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables during fiscal 2016  we completed four  term securitizations funding a total of 436 billion  of auto loan receivables 

as of february 29 2016  140 billion  of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time as our store base sales and caf loan originations have grown as of february 29 2016  the combined warehouse facility limit was 250 billion  and unused warehouse capacity totaled 110 billion  of the combined warehouse facility limit 100 billion  will expire in august 2016  and 150 billion  will expire in february 2017  see notes 2f and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

the securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to securitize receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the securitized receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

we expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations borrowings under existing new or expanded credit facilities and other funding arrangements will be sufficient to fund caf capital expenditures repurchases of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements 

the timing and amount of stock repurchases are determined based on share price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock as of february 29 2016  the board had authorized a total of 380 billion  of repurchases at that date 140 billion  was available for repurchase under the board’s outstanding authorization which expires on december 31 2016  see note 12 for more information on share repurchase activity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

auto loan receivables 

as of february 29 2016  and february 28 2015  all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved primarily through asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and variablerate securities our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies other receivables are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities 

c omposition of  a uto  l oan  r eceivables 



  

   

interest rate exposure 

we have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility substantially all of these borrowings are variablerate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2016  net earnings per share by approximately 001  we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our term loan however the variablerate risk is mitigated by a derivative instrument 

borrowings under our warehouse facilities are also variablerate debt and are secured by auto loan receivables on which we collect interest at fixed rates the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement this variablerate risk is mitigated by funding the receivables through a term securitization or other funding arrangement and by entering into derivative instruments absent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk a 100basis point increase in market interest rates associated with the warehouse facilities would have decreased our fiscal 2016  net earnings per share by approximately 004  

  

other market exposures 

our pension plan has interest rate risk related to its projected benefit obligation pbo due to the relatively young overall age of the plan’s participants a 100basis point change in the discount rate has approximately a 20  effect on the pbo balance a 100basis point decrease in the discount rate would have decreased our fiscal 2016  net earnings per share by less than 001  see note 10 for more information on our benefit plans 

  

as our cashsettled restricted stock units are liability awards the related compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the company’s stock price the marktomarket effect on the liability depends on each award’s grant price and previously recognized expense at february 29 2016  a 100 change in the company’s stock price would have affected fiscal 2016  net earnings per share by less than 001

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background 

carmax inc seeks to deliver an unrivaled customer experience by offering a broad selection of high quality used vehicles and related products and services at low nohaggle prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility our strategy is to revolutionize the used auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers by focusing on customer service associate development and efficient execution we have become the nation’s largest retailer of used cars selling 582282 used vehicles at retail during the fiscal year ended february 28 2015 in addition we are one of the nation’s largest operators of wholesale vehicle auctions and one of the nation’s largest providers of used vehicle financing 

 

carmax was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax store in richmond virginia on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company as of february 28 2015 we operated 144 used car stores in 73 metropolitan markets our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

carmax business 

we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through carmax stores 

carmax sales operations our carmax sales operations segment sells used vehicles purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources sells related products and services and arranges financing options for customers all for fixed nohaggle prices we enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer 

purchasing a vehicle    

the vehicle purchase process in a carmax store differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience our nohaggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers in addition our sales consultants are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate this pay structure aligns our sales associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

we recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our carmax quality certified standards and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale we stand behind every used vehicle we sell with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty 

we maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory of more than 60000 vehicles as of february 28 2015 available for viewing on our website carmaxcom as well as our mobile apps upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in this inventory to a local store this allows a single carmax store to offer access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer in fiscal 2015 31 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request 

in addition to retailing used vehicles we sell new vehicles at four locations under franchise agreements with three new car manufacturers in fiscal 2015 new vehicles comprised 1 of our total retail vehicle unit sales 

selling us a vehicle  

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a customer’s vehicle free of charge and make a written guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us this nohaggle offer is good for seven days 

based on their age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through our instore appraisal process meet our retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions  unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers as of february 28 2015 we conducted wholesale auctions at 62 of our 144 stores during fiscal 2015 we sold 376186 wholesale vehicles through these onsite auctions in fiscal 2015 with an average auction sales rate of 97 

financing a vehicle    

the availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process and having an array of finance sources increases approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to 

 

carmax our finance program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both caf and thirdparty providers we believe that our processes and systems transparency of pricing and vehicle quality as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit allow caf and our thirdparty providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment all finance offers whether from caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3 ‑day payoff option which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge 

related products and services  

we provide customers with a range of other related products and services including extended protection plan “epp” products and vehicle repair service epp products include   extended service plans “esps”   and   guaranteed asset protection “gap” which   is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business in fiscal 2015 more than 60 of the customers who purchased a retail vehicle also purchased an esp and more than 25 purchased gap 

carmax auto finance caf provides financing solely to customers of carmax caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide customers with a competitive financing option caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely through carmax stores our scoring models are optimized for the carmax channe l we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 412 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2015 

caf also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements collecting payments maintaining contact with delinquent customers and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans as of february 28 2015 caf serviced approximately 619000 customer accounts in its 846 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

competition 

carmax sales operations   the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive according to industry sources as of december 31 2014  there were approximately 18000 franchised automotive dealerships which sell both new and used vehicles in addition used vehicles were sold by more than 35000 independent used vehicle dealers as well as millions of private individuals our primary retail competitors are franchised auto dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles competition in our industry is increasingly affected by the use of internetbased marketing and other internetbased tools for both consumers and the dealers with whom we compete 

based on industry data there were approximately 39 million used cars sold in the us in calendar 2014 of which approximately 21 million were estimated to be 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us in calendar 2014 we sold approximately 5 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold in the markets for which we operate and less than 3 of the age 0 to 10year old vehicles sold nationwide 

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our low nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available on site and via carmaxcom and our mobile apps the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems the transparency and availability of caf and thirdparty financing and the locations of our retail stores in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our high volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards 

our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast to the highly fragmented used vehicle retail market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc who together represent an estimated 70 of the north american wholesale car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax’s auctions predominantly sell older higher mileage vehicles 

 

carmax auto finance caf operates in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies according to industry sources this sector represented nearly 900 billion in outstanding receivables as of december 31 2014  caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars for loans originated during the calendar quarter ended december 31 2014 industry sources ranked caf 7th in market share for used vehicle loans and 1 4 th in market share for all vehicle loans 

we believe that caf’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source in carmax stores and that caf’s primary driver for growth is the growth in carmax’s retail unit sales we periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness we also monitor 3day payoffs as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our rates

retail merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old and generally range in price from 12000 to 34 000 the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences 

wholesale auctions the typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auct ioneers conduct our auctions dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase our auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis 

  

extended protection plans at the time of sale we offer customers epp products we sell these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors and in return receive commission income we have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract all epps that we sell other than manufacturer programs on new car sales have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements periodically we may receive additional commissions based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products   

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our standards before it can become a carmax quality certified vehicle this process includes a comprehensive carmax quality inspection of the engine and all major systems based on this inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our quality standards many of our stores depend upon nearby typically larger carmax stores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services we engage third parties specializing in those services 

in addition all carmax used car stores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by the esps we sell 

customer credit we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and arrangements with several financial institutions vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicle as of february 28 2015 our thirdparty finance providers included santander consumer usa wells fargo dealer services exeter finance corp capital one auto finance ally financial inc american credit acceptance and westlake financial services we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers and periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

all credit applications submitted by customers at carmax stores are initially reviewed by caf applications that are declined or conditionally approved by caf are generally evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we refer to the providers who pay us a fee as tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as tier 3 providers we are willing to pay a fee to tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that they may not otherwise be able to obtain all fees paid by tier 2 providers and paid to tier 3 providers are prenegotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount 

 

financed   the interest rate the term of the loan or the loantovalue ratio as part of our previously disclosed loan origination test caf currently provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a tier 3 provider 

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

suppliers for used vehicles 

we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process as well as through other sources including local regional and online auctions we also to a lesser extent acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market 

the supply of latemodel used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the rate of new vehicle sales which in turn generate used car tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry sources there were approximately 250 million light vehicles in operation in the us as of december 31 2014 during calendar year 2014 more than 16 million new cars and 39 million used cars were sold at retail many of which were accompanied by tradeins and more than 9 million vehicles were sold at wholesale auctions 

based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year consumer acceptance of our instore appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

seasonality 

historically our business has been seasonal our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter we typically experience an increase in traffic and sales in february and march coinciding with tax refund season 

systems 

our stores are supported by proprietary information system s that improve the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions including our credit processing information system  o ur proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity 

our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location leveraging our more than twenty years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles our system generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that take into account factors that include sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99   of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

marketing and advertising 

our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmaxcom and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle we implement these strategies through both traditional and digital methods including social media our carmaxcom website and related mobile apps are marketing tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to initiate part of the shopping and sales process online the website and mobile apps also include a variety of other customer service features including initiation of vehicle transfers and scheduling appointments information on the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated several times per day our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2015 approximately 89  of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online 

 

associates 

on february 28 2015 we had a total of 22064 full and parttime associates including 16049 hourly and salaried associates and 6015 sales associates who worked on a commission basis we employ additional associates during peak selling seasons we believe we have created a unique corporate culture and maintain good employee relations no associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement we focus on developing our associates and providing them with the information and resources they need to offer exceptional customer service and have been recognized for the success of our efforts by a number of external organizations 

intellectual property 

our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy our principal trademarks including carmax and the related family of marks have been registered with the us patent and trademark office 

  

laws and regulations 

vehicle dealer and other laws and regulations we operate in a highly regulated industry in every state in which we operate we must obtain licenses and permits to conduct business including dealer service sales and finance licenses issued by state and local regulatory authorities a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations govern the manner in which we conduct business including advertising sales financing and employment practices these laws include consumer protection laws privacy laws and state franchise laws as well as other laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers these laws also include federal and state wagehour antidiscrimination and other employment practices laws our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truthinlending consumer leasing equal credit opportunity and fair credit reporting laws and regulations all of which are subject to enforcement by the federal consumer financial protection bureau or federal trade commission as well as state and local motor vehicle finance collection repossession and installment finance laws

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business sales results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

we operate in a highly competitive industry  failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation’s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

  

automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices new car dealers in particular including publiclytraded auto retailers have increased their sales of used vehicles in recent years  these new car dealers also leverage their franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers to brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax 

some of our competitors have announced plans for rapid expansion including into markets with carmax locations and some of them have begun to execute those plans  some of our competitors have also replicated or attempted to replicate portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car store in 1993 including our use of low nohaggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer’s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us 

the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles and to provide vehicle financing could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations the increasing online availability of used vehicle information including pricing information could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines and online classified sites that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmaxcom to attract traffic these companies could also make it more difficult for carmax othe rwise to market its vehicles online 

the increasing use of the internet to facilitate consumers’ sales or tradeins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations for example certain websites   provide online appraisal tools to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than carmax the popularity of these tools appears to be increasing 

in addition to the direct competition and increasing use of the internet described above there are companies that sell software solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to among other things more efficiently source and price inventory although these companies do not compete with carmax the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with carmax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of carmax’s internally developed proprietary systems 

if any of   these trend s continue they could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations  

our caf s egment is subject to competition from various financial institutions including banks and credit unions which provide vehicle financing to consumers if we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our thirdparty financing providers which financings are generally less profitable to carmax in addition we believe that caf allows us to capture additional sales accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance offers to our customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

carmax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which our 

 

reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation and could involve among other things our sales process our provision of financing our reconditioning process or our treatment of customers  even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results 

the growing use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected we monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns provide accurate information and protect our reputation but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions these conditions could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to national and regional us economic conditions these conditions include but are not limited to recession inflation interest rates unemployment levels the state of the housing market gasoline prices consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general these conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as acts of terrorism when these economic conditions worsen or stagnate it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally including the used vehicles that we sell and the availability of consumer credit to finance vehicle purchases this could result in lower sales decreased margins on units sold and decreased profits for our caf segment worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of latemodel used vehicles as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time this could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold 

  

these dynamics were apparent in the difficult us economic environment during the most recent recession  which adversely affected the automotive retail industry in general including carmax while many of these indicators have improved more recently there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so or that improvements will result in benefits to our sales and results of operations any significant change or deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business is dependent upon capital to fund growth and to support the activities of our caf s egment changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support our geographic expansion could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth although we have financed recent geographic expansion primarily with internally generated cash flows there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flows to fund growth failure to do so—or our decision to put our cash to other uses—would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our geographic expansion 

changes in the availability or cost of the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loan receivables through caf could adversely affect sales and results of operations we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our revolving credit facility  term loan and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions—especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows—could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on thirdparty financing providers to finance a significant portion of our customers’ vehicle purchases accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties 

we provide financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty financing providers if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide financing to our customers provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we rely on thirdparty providers to supply epp products to our customers accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these thirdparties 

we sell epp products on behalf of unrelated thirdparties who are the primary obligors  and in return we receive commission income the thirdparties that provide esps are cna nat ional warranty corporation and t he warranty group the thirdparty that provides gap products is safeguard products international llc if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide epp products make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations  additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our more than 22 000   associates 

  

our associates are the driving force behind our success we believe that one of the things that sets carmax apart is a culture centered on valuing all associates our failure to maintain this culture or to continue recruiting developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates our growth plans changes in employment legislation and competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and for qualified service technicians in particular our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is also subject to our ability to maintain positive associate relations if we are unable to do so or if despite our efforts we become subject to successful unionization efforts it could increase costs limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our success also depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers a breach of this confidentiality whether due to a cybersecurity or other incident could result in harm to our customers and damage to our brand 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers this information includes the information customers provide when purchasing a vehicle and applying for vehicle financing we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential associate information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers although we have taken measures designed to safeguard such information and have received assurances from our thirdparty providers our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty providers could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events numerous national retailers have disclosed security breaches involving sophisticated cyberattacks which were not recognized or detected until after such retailers had been affected notwithstanding the preventive measures such retailers had in place any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or 

 

associate information whether experienced by us or by our thirdparty service providers and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident a programming error or other cause could damage our reputation expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement disrupt our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to such a security breach could exacerbate the consequences of the breach 

our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles 

any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for example if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap in addition any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins 

our business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory obstacles to acquiring inventory—whether because of supply competition or other factors—or a failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations although the supply of latemodel used vehicles appears to be increasing recently there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that it will benefit carmax 

we source a significant percentage of our vehicles though our appraisal process and these vehicles are generally more profitable for carmax accordingly if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or fail to recognize those trends it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory it could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from thirdparty auctions which is generally less profitable for carmax our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition both from new and used car dealers directly and through thirdparty websites driving appraisal traffic to those dealers see the risk factor above titled “ we operate in a highly competitive industry ” for discussion of this risk our ability to source vehicles from thirdparty auctions could be affected by an increase in the number of closed auctions that are open only to new car dealers who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers 

used vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk accordingly if we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations changes in these laws and regulations or our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations our sale of used vehicles is subject to state and local licensing requirements federal and state laws regulating vehicle advertising and state laws regulating vehicle sales and service our provision of vehicle financing is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies and large employers generally including federal employment practices securities and tax laws for additional discussion of these laws and regulations see the section of this form 10k titled “ laws and regulations ” 

the violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against our business operations any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations 

recent federal legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms may result in an increase in expenses or a decrease in revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” regulates among other things the provision of consumer financing the doddfrank act established a new federal agency the consumer 

 

financial protection bureau “cfpb” with broad regulatory powers over consumer financial products and activities in september 2014 the cfpb proposed to extend its supervisory authority to large nonbank auto finance companies including carmax we expect that the cfpb will seek to conduct supervisory examinations of nonbank auto finance companies like carmax to ensure compliance with various federal consumer protection laws  the evolving regulatory environment in the wake of the continued implementation of the doddfrank act and the expansion of the cfpb ’s authority may increase the cost of regulatory compliance or result in changes to business practices that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as it is phased in over time significantly affects the provision of health care services and will increase the costs we incur to provide our associates with health coverage current federal labor policy could lead to increased unionization efforts which could increase labor costs disrupt store operations and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities continue to scrutinize advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced see the risk factor titled “ we operate in a highly competitive industry ” for discussion of this risk 

we are a growth retailer our failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business  sales and results of operations 

the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our information systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations the expansion of our store base also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion see the risk factor above titled “ our success depends upon the continued contributions of our more than 2 2 000 associates ” for discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base also requires real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are forced to curtail or stop growth   it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated information systems to run our business the failure of these systems   could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to manage sales inventory our customerfacing websites carmaxcom and carmaxauctionscom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

in addition despite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems we could be subjected to attacks by hackers including denialofservice attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations see the risk factor above titled “ we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers ” for the risks associated with a breach of confidential customer or associate information 

we are subject to numerous legal proceedings if the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to carmax it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various litigation matters from time to time which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these claims could be asserted under a variety of laws including but not limited to consumer finance laws consumer protection laws intellectual property laws privacy laws labor and employment laws securities laws and employee benefit laws these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

 

our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers  including manufacturer recalls  

adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles including the supply of latemodel used vehicles in addition manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence that have recently accelerated in frequency and scope  recalls could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations  could cause us to temporarily remove vehicles from inventory could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled vehicle s  which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates as well as changes in accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of carmax’s assets liabilities revenues expenses   and earnings if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 

the implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

our business is sensitive to weather events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

we are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated 

our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us including florida and in texas southern california and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experienced a downturn in economic conditions it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

we conduct our retail vehicle operations in two basic formats – production and nonproduction stores production stores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production stores have more service bays and require additional space for workinprocess inventory and   therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction store on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some stores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may 

 

initially be operated as nonproduction stores until we expand our presence in that market as of february   2 8    20 15  we op erated 79 production stores and 65 nonproduction stores  production stores are generally on 10 to 25 acres  but a few range from 25 to 35 acres and nonproduction stores are generally on 4 to 12 acres 

after a period of testing we recently announced our plan to incorporate small format stores into our future store opening plans these stores are located in smaller markets or areas where the sales opportunity is below that of midsized and large markets and they are generally located on 3 to 7 acres although small format stores with production capabilities may be somewhat larger a s of february 28 2015 we had 6 small format stores 

as of february 28 2015 we operated 62 wholesale auctions most of which were located at production stores stores at which auctions are conducted generally have additional space to store wholesale inventory as of february 28 2015  we also operated one new car store which was located adjacent to our used car s tore in laurel maryland our remaining three new car franchises are operated as part of our used car stores 

used car stores as of february 28 2015 

  



  

as of february 28  20 15  we leased 57 of our 144   used car stores our new car store and our caf office building in atlanta georgia we owned the remaining 87 used car stores currently in operation we also own ed our home office building in richmond v irginia and land associated with planned future store openings   

 

expansion 

since opening our first used car store in 1993 we have grown organically through the construction and opening of companyoperated stores we do not franchise our operations as of february 28 2015 we operated 144 used car stores in 73 us markets which covered   approximately 61 of the us population we believe that further geographic expansion and additional fillin opportunities in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth we currently plan to open between 13 and 16 stores in each of the next three fiscal years in fiscal 201 6 we plan to open 14 new stores and relocate one store whose lease is expiring

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented in item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data note references are to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation all references to net earnings per share are to diluted net earnings per share amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding 

overview 

see part 1 item 1 for a detailed description and discussion of the company’s business 

  

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through carmax stores 

carmax sales operations 

our sales operations segment consists of retail sales of used vehicles and related products and services such as wholesale vehicle sales the sale of extended protection plan “epp” products which include extended service plans “esp” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” and vehicle repair service gap   is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft we focus on addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers while maximizing operating efficiencies we offer low no ‑haggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles valueadded epp products and superior customer service   

our customers finance the majority of the retail vehicles purchased from us and the availability of onthespot financing is a critical component of the sales process we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with several industryleading thirdparty finance providers all of the finance offers whether by caf or our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3 ‑day payoff option 

as of february 28 2015 we operated 144 used car stores in 73 markets covering 47 midsized markets 20 large markets and 6 small markets we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000 and 3 million people as of that date we also conducted wholesale auctions at 62 used car stores and we operated four new car franchises 

carmax auto finance 

in addition to thirdparty financing providers we provide vehicle financing through caf which offers financing solely to our customers in our stores caf allows us to manage our reliance on thirdparty financing providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option as a result we believe caf enables us to capture additional profits cash flows and sales after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 41 2  of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2015 as of february 28 2015 caf serviced approximately 619 000 customer accounts in its  846 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

management regularly analyzes caf’s operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer profitability the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses 

revenues and profitability 

during fiscal 2015 net sales and operating revenues increased 135   net earnings grew 213  and net earnings per share increase d   264  these yearoveryear comparisons benefited from the receipt of proceeds in a class action lawsuit in fiscal 2015 and a correction to our accounting related to cancellation reserves for epp products in fiscal 2014 excluding these items fiscal 2015 net earnings grew 159 and net earnings per share increased 203 

our primary source of revenue and net income is the retail sale of used vehicles   during fiscal 2015 we sold 5 82282 used cars representing 9 85  of the total 591  149 vehicles we sold at retail 8 18  of our net sales and operating revenues and 672  of our gross profit used vehicle unit sales grew 105 including a 44 increase in comparable store used units and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base 

 

wholesale sales are also a significant contributor to our revenues and net income   during fiscal 2015 we sold 376186 wholesale vehicles representing 1 44  of our net sales and operating revenues and 19 3  of our gross profit wholesale vehicle unit sales grew 98 reflecting improved appraisal traffic and the growth in our store base 

during fiscal 2015 other sales and revenues which include commissions earned on the sale of epp products service department sales and net thirdparty finance fees increased 312 excluding the prior year’s epp cancellation reserve correction other sales and revenues grew 210 primarily due to the growth in retail unit sales these items represented 131 of our gross profit 

income from our caf segment totaled  3673 million in fiscal 2015  up 93 compared with fiscal 2014  caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs 

liquidity 

our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from securitization transactions and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other sources during fiscal 2015 liquidity was primarily provided by 122 billion in net issuances of nonrecourse notes payable 6279 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at the start of the year a 300 million term loan and 2541 million of adjusted net cash provided by operations a nongaap measure this liquidity was primarily used to fund the increase in caf auto loan receivables the 175 million common shares repurchased under our share repurchase program and   our store growth 

in fiscal 2015 net cash used in operating activities totaled  9681 million  while net cash provided by operating activities excluding the increase in se curitized auto loan receivables equaled  2541 million when considering cash provided by operating activities management does not include increases in auto loan receivables that have been securitized with nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities for a reconciliation of adjusted net cash provided by operations to net cash used in operating activities the most directly comparable gaap financial measure see “reconciliation of adjusted net cash from operating activities” included in “financial condition  liquidity and capital resources” 

future outlook 

over the long term we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base we also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and over time increased caf income to expand our vehicle unit sales at new and existing stores we will need to continue delivering an unrivaled customer experience and hiring and developing the associates necessary to drive our success while managing the risks posed by an evolving competitive environment in addition to support our store growth plans we will need to continue procuring suitable real estate at favorable terms 

we are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 28 2015 we had used car stores located in markets that comprised approximately 61 of the us population we opened 10 stores in fiscal 2013 13 stores in fiscal 2014 and 13 stores in fiscal 2015 we currently plan to open between 13 and 16 stores in each of the next three fiscal years in fiscal 2016 we plan to open 14 new stores and relocate one store whose lease is expiring see “fiscal 2016 planned store openings” included elsewhere in mda for a detailed list of fiscal 2016 planned store openings 

see “risk factors” included in part i item 1a of this form 10k for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our company  

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because 

 

their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving securitization program composed of two warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations as secured borrowings which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses  

auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through caf the receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance 

se e notes 2f 2i and 4 for additional inf ormation on securitizations and auto loan receivables 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5 ‑day moneyback guarantee we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends  and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors to customers who purchase a vehicle the esps we currently offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations periodically we may receive additional commissions based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products these additional commissions are recognized as revenue when received the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience recent trends and credit mix of the customer base our risk related to contract cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of esp and gap sales customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates a 10 change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately 94 million as of february 28 2015 see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves 

customers applying for financing who are not approved by caf may be evaluated by other thirdparty finance providers  these providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we recognize these fees at the time of sale 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted  see note 9 for additional information on income taxes 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider available carrybacks future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation 

 

allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 28 2015 will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination

the fiscal 2015 store openings included 10 stores in 9 new markets 1 store each in rochester new york dothan alabama spokane washington madison wisconsin lynchburg virginia tupelo mississippi reno nevada and cleveland ohio and 2 stores in portland oregon and 3 stores in existing markets harrisburglancaster pennsylvania dallas texas and raleigh north carolina the dothan lynchburg and tupelo stores are small format stores 

  

in recent years we have tested small format stores which generally are located in smaller markets where the sales opportunity is below that of midsized and large markets while these stores are anticipated to sell fewer vehicles compared with our stores in larger markets they have a smaller footprint employ fewer associates and have less overhead compared with other carmax stores based on performance in our test stores we are incorporating additional small format stores into our future store opening plans 

  

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 the 1 33  increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted from a 105 increase in used unit sales and a 25 increase in average retail vehicle selling price  the increase in used unit sales included a 44  increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit growth reflected improved customer traffic as well as improved conversion our data indicates that in our markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by approximately 5 in calendar 2014 

the increase in average retail vehicle selling price primarily reflected changes in our sales mix with an increased mix of 0to 4year old vehicles in fiscal 2015 from 2008 through 2012 new car industry sales were at rates significantly below prerecession levels which affected the overall supply and acquisition costs of latemodel used vehicles as the supply of latermodel used vehicles has gradually improved our inventory mix has shifted accordingly 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 the 178 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2014 resulted from a corresponding increase in used unit sales the increase in unit sales included a 122 increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit growth was primarily driven by improved conversion as well as a modest increase in store traffic we believe the 

 

strong conversion reflected continued improvements in execution in our stores and an attractive credit environment experienced during fiscal 2014 our data indicates that in our markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by approximately 16  in fiscal 2014 

wholesale vehicle sales 

our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles bought through our appraisal process and sold in our auctions 

fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 the 124  increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted from a 98  increase in wholesale unit sales and a 22  increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price the wholesale unit growth reflected both an increase in the appraisal buy rate and the growth in our store base  

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 the 36 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2014 resulted from a 55 increase in wholesale unit sales partially offset by a 21 reduction in average wholesale vehicle selling price the wholesale unit growth primarily reflected the growth in our store base as well as an increase in the appraisal buy rate however we experienced a reduced mix of wholesale vehicles in our appraisal traffic that partially offset the benefit of our store growth and increased buy rate 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of esps and gap   collectively reported in epp revenues   net of a reserve for estimated contract cancellations service department sales and   net thirdparty finance fees the fixed pervehicle fees that we pay to the tier 3 providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the tier 2 providers  

during fiscal 2014 we corrected our accounting related to cancellation reserves for esp and gap with resulting increases in reserves related to activity for fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 the portion related to fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was 195 million or 005 per share in the following discussions where indicated yearoveryear comparisons exclude the portion of the correction that related to earlier fiscal years 

fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 excluding the prior year’s epp cancellation reserve correction other sales and revenues grew 210 in fiscal 2015 epp revenue grew 119 excluding the prior year’s cancellation reserve correction  largely reflecting the increase in our retail unit sales net thirdparty finance fees improved 230 primarily due to a mix shift among providers including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by the tier 2 providers and a reduction in the percentage financed by the tier 3 providers the percentage of retail vehicles financed by tier 3 providers combined with those financed under the previously announced caf loan origination test was 156 in fiscal 2015 compared with 188 in fiscal 2014 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 excluding the epp cancellation reserve correction ot her sales and revenues increased 14  in fiscal 201 4 epp revenue grew 126 excluding the cancellation reserve correction  reflecting the increase in our retail unit sales and a higher epp penetration rate partially offset by higher estimated cancellation reserve rates the 267 million decrease in net thirdparty finance fees was driven by a mix shift among providers including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by tier 3 providers to 1 88  in fiscal 201 4 versus 1 5 9 in fiscal 201 3  throughout fiscal 201 3 and for most of fiscal 201 4  the volume and share of financing originated by the tier 3 providers increased on a yearoveryear basis as these providers made more attractive offers to customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 however the tier   3 providers moderated their credit offerings and as a result their share of financings for the fourth quarter was flat with fiscal 2013 

  

 

  

gross profit 

  



  

gross profit per unit 

  



  





  

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and the pace of our inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit 

we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction or through other channels 

fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 the 109 increase in u sed vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2015 was driven by the corresponding increase in used unit sales used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent   

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 the 177 increase in used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2014 was driven by the corresponding increase in used unit sales used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions   the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles our ability to adjust appraisal offers in response to the wholesale pricing environment is a key factor that influences wholesale gross profit 

fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 the 163 increase in w holesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2015 reflected the combination of the   98  increase in wholesale unit sales with a 59  increase in wholesale gross profit per unit   

 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 the 19 increase in wholesale vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2014 reflected the 55 increase in wholesale unit sales partially offset by a 35 reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to epp revenues net thirdparty finance fees and service department operations including used vehicle reconditioning we have no cost of sales related to epp revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent commissions paid to us by certain thirdparty providers  thirdparty finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to thirdparty tier 3 finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

the fiscal 2014 correction in accounting for epp cancellation reserves reduced fiscal 2014 other gross profit by 195 million related to activity for fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 

fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014 excluding the prior year’s epp cancellation reserve correction o ther gross profit increased 205 in fiscal 2015 consistent with the changes in other sales and revenues discussed above 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 excluding the epp cancellation reserve correction ot her gross profit   increased 146  in fiscal 201 4 this change reflected the net effects of the 126 increase in epp revenues excluding the cancellation reserve correction the 267 million decrease in net thirdparty finance fees and higher service department gross profits the 273 million increase in fiscal 2014 service department gross profit primarily reflected increases in gross profit associated with used vehicle reconditioning which benefited from strong used unit sales growth   and the resulting leverage of service overhead costs 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not had a significant impact on results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices however increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit caf income to the extent the average amount financed also increases 

in the years following the recession we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing we believe the appreciation resulted in part from a reduced supply of latemodel used vehicles in the market  this reduced supply was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle tradein activity compared with prerecession periods the higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our used vehicle average selling prices  which climbed from 16291 in fiscal 2009 to 19 897 in fiscal 2015 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

  

components of sga expense 

  



  





  

fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014  sga expenses for fiscal 2015 were reduced by 209 million or 006 per share which represented our receipt of settlement proceeds in a class action lawsuit related to the economic loss 

 

associated with certain toyota vehicles excluding this gain sga expenses grew 107 in fiscal 2015 this increase reflected the combination of several factors including the 10  increase in our store base during fiscal 201 5 representing the addition of 13 stores  higher variable selling costs resulting from the 44 increase in comparable store used unit sales  and an 115 million increase in sharebased compensation expense which was influenced by the 39 increase in the per share price of our common stock from february 28 2014 to february 28 2015 excluding the settlement gain sga per retail unit was 2163 in fiscal 2015 similar to   the fiscal 201 4 level  

  

f iscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 t he 120 increase in sga expense in fiscal 2014 reflected the 11  increase in our store base representing the addition of 1 3 stores and higher variable selling costs resulting from the 122  increase in comparable store used unit sales sga costs were also affected by the increase in the rate of our store openings from 10 stores in fiscal 2013 to 13 stores in fiscal 2014 sga per retail unit declined as our comparable store used unit sales growth generated overhead leverage  

  

interest expense 

fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014  interest expense declined to 245 million in fiscal 2015 versus 308 million in fiscal 2014 during fiscal 2015 we capitalized 89 million in interest costs associated with construction costs of certain facilities excluding the capitalized interest costs the yearoveryear increase in interest expense primarily reflected interest expense on a 300 million term loan entered into in november 2014 

  

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013  interest expense declined to 308 million in fiscal 2014 versus 324 million in fiscal 2013 in both years the interest related primarily to our outstanding finance and capital lease obligations 

  

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 384  in fiscal 2015 382 in fiscal 2014 and 381 in fiscal 2013  

  

  

results of operations – carmax auto finance 

caf income primarily reflects interest and fee income generated by   caf’s   portfolio of auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expense s caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs although caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures we have not allocated indirect costs to caf to avoid making subjective allocation decisions examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources administrative services marketing information systems accounting legal treasury and executive payroll 

  

caf’s managed portfolio is composed primarily of loans originated over the past several years trends in receivable growth and interest margins primarily reflect the cumulative effect of changes in the business over a multiyear period trends in portfolio losses and delinquencies are affected by changes in our origination strategies over time as well as current economic conditions current period originations reflect current trends in both our retail sales and the caf business including the volume of loans originated current interest rates charged to consumers loan terms and average credit scores because we recognize caf income over the life of the underlying auto loan loans originated in a given fiscal period generally do not have a significant effect on that period’s financial results 

see note 3 for additional information on caf income and note 4 for information on auto loan receivables including credit quality 

 

components of caf income 





  

fiscal 2015 versus fiscal 2014  the 93 increase in caf income resulted from the growth in caf’s average managed receivables partially offset by a lower total interest margin as a percent of average managed receivables  average managed receivables grew 186 to 786 billion in fiscal 2015 

  

total interest margin which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs declined as a percentage of total average managed receivables to 65 in fiscal 2015 from 69 in fiscal 2014 this reflected the combination of i a gradual decline in the average contract rate charged on new loan originations in recent years with ii an increase in our average funding costs for more recent securitizations changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time as these loans come to represent an increasing percentage of managed receivables rising interest rates which affect caf’s funding costs or further competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013  the 123 increase in caf income resulted from the growth in caf’s managed receivables partially offset by a lower total interest margin rate average managed receivables grew 231 to 663 billion in fiscal 2014 

  

total interest margin declined to 69 in fiscal 2014 from 74 in fiscal 2013 a strategic decision made in midfiscal 2013 to provide more competitive finance offers contributed to both the decline in the weighted average contract rate on loan originations to 70 in fiscal 2014 from 79 in fiscal 2013 and to the decline in total interest margin

net loans originated in fiscal 2015 increased 130 primarily reflecting the 133 growth in our retail vehicle revenues the increase in caf’s penetration rate in fiscal 2015 included the effect of an increase in loans originated in the caf loan origination test 

  

net loans originated in fiscal 2014 increased 214 reflecting both the 175 growth in our retail vehicle revenues and an increase in caf’s penetration rate which benefited from favorable responses to the change in our credit offers 

  

loan origination test in january 2014 caf launched a test originating loans for customers who typically would be financed by our tier 3 finance providers through february 28 2015 net loans originated in this test totaled 722 million of which 631 million were originated in fiscal 2015 because the loans in this test have higher loss and delinquency rates than the aggregate of the current caf portfolio they also have higher contract rates the test is being funded separately from the remainder of caf’s portfolio and is not included in our current securitization program we currently plan to extend this test at a similar rate of originations while continuing to evaluate the performance of these loans 

  

allowance for loan losses 

  



  



  

the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the 169 increase in the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses as of february 28 2015 compared with a year earlier largely reflected the growth in managed receivables the allowance for loan losses as a percent of managed receivables remained consistent as of february 28 2015 and february 28 2014 

 

loan performance information 

  



  

the average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated generally at our wholesale auctions the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42 to a high of 60 and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment 

planned future activities 

  

we plan to open between 13 and 16 stores in each of the next three fiscal years in fiscal 2016 we plan to open 14 new stores and relocate one store whose lease is expiring in fiscal 2016 we also plan to remodel approximately 15 older stores we currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately 360 million in fiscal 2016

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations store expansion and improvement including capital expenditures and inventory purchases and caf since fiscal 2013 we have also elected to use cash for our share repurchase program as a result of these activities over the last two fiscal years we have reduced the cash and cash equivalents we hold and during fiscal 2015 increased our borrowings our primary ongoing sources of liquidity include funds provided by operations proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or through other sources  

  

operating activities  net cash used in operating activities of 9681 million includes increases in auto loan receivables of 137 billion in fiscal 2015 the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities when considering cash provided by operating activities management uses an adjusted measure of net cash from operating activities that offsets the changes in auto loan receivables with the corresponding changes in nonrecourse notes payable this is achieved by adding back the net cash provided from the issuance of nonrecourse notes payable which represents the increase in auto loan receivables that were securitized through the issuance of nonrecourse notes payable during the period the resulting financial measure adjusted net cash from operating activities is a nongaap financial measure we believe adjusted net cash from operating activities is a meaningful metric for investors because it provides better visibility into the cash generated from operations including the increases in nonrecourse notes payable net cash provided by operating activities would have been as follows 

  

reconciliation of adjusted net cash from operating activities 

  



  



  

as of february 28 2015 total inventory was  209 billion representing an increase of  4455 million or 271  compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year the increase reflected a combination of factors including an intentional build in inventories in the fall and winter of 2014 to better position us for seasonal sales opportunities the 13 new stores opened during fiscal 2015 added inventories to support our comparable store sales growth and belowtarget inventories at the start of the fiscal year 

  

as of february 28 2014 total inventory was 164 billion representing an increase of 1236 million or 8 1  compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year the increase reflected the 13 stores opened during fiscal 2014 as well as added inventories to support our comparable store sales growth inventory levels were below target levels as of the end of fiscal 2014 due to disruptions in reconditioning activities caused by unusually severe weather experienced during the fourth quarter of th at fiscal year 

  

investing activities  net cash used in investing activities totaled 3607 million in fiscal 2015 3367 million in fiscal 2014 and 2553 million in fiscal 2013 investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled 3098 million in fiscal 2015 3103 million in fiscal 2014 and 2357 million in fiscal 2013 capital expenditures primarily include real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings  store construction costs and store remodeling expenses  we maintain a multiyear pipeline of sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we open in subsequent fiscal years we opened 13 stores in fiscal 2015 13 stores in fiscal 2014 and 10 stores in fiscal 2013 

  

as of february 28 201 5  we owned 87 and leased 57 of our 1 44 used car stores 

  

financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities totaled 7286 million in fiscal 2015 113 billion in fiscal 2014 and 104 billion in fiscal 2013 included in these amounts were net increases in total nonrecourse notes payable of 122 billion 139 billion and 117 billion respectively which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of 137 billion 132 billion and 9922 million respectively in auto 

 

loan receivables see operating activities during fiscal 2015 we received proceeds of 300 million from a floating rate term loan entered into in november 2014 n et cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of 9170 million in fiscal 2015 3072 million in fiscal 2014 and 2034 million in fiscal 2013  

  

total debt and cash and cash equivalents 

  



  

we have a 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in august 2016 the borrowing capacity under this credit facility was increased by 300 million during fiscal 2015 borrowings under this facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us see note 11 for additional information on the revolving credit facility 

in november 2014 we entered into a 300 million floating rate term loan due november 2017 see note 11 for additional information on the term loan 

the credit facility and term loan agreements contain representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements were not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity 

caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles  even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables  we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles  loans originated in the previously announced caf loan origination test are being funded using existing working capital and are not included in our current securitization program 

the timing of principal payments on the nonrecourse notes payable is based on principal collections net of losses on the securitized auto loan receivables the current portion of nonrecourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period 

as of february 28 2015  748 billion of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations thes e notes payable accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates and have scheduled maturities through   september 2021  but they may mature earlier  depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables during fiscal 2015 we completed four term securitizations funding a total of 415 billion of auto loan receivables 

as of   february 28 2015  9860   million of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities we have periodically increased our warehouse facility limit over time as our store base sales and caf loan originations have grown during fiscal 2015 we increased the combined limit of our warehouse facilities by an additional 500 million as of february 28 2015 the combined warehouse facility limit was 23 billion and unused warehouse capacity totaled 131 billion  of the combined warehouse facility limit 800 million will expire in july 2015 and 15 billion will expire in february 2016 the return requirements of the warehouse facility investors could fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions at renewal the cost structure and capacity of the facilities could change these changes could have a significant effect on our funding costs see notes 2f and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

the securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to securitize 

 

receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the securitized receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

we expect that adjusted net cash provided by operations and other funding arrangements saleleaseback transactions and borrowings under existing new or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund caf capital expenditures repurchase of stock and working capital for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing  funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements 

beginning i n fiscal 2013 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common stock purchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions at management’s discretion and the timing and amount of repurchases are determined based on share price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock as of february 28 2015 the board had authorized a total of 38 billion of repurchases including 30 billion authorized in fiscal 2015 as of february   28   2015 237 billion was available for repurchase under the authorizations of which 3693 million expires on december 31 2015  and 20 billion expires on december 31 2016 see note 1 2 for more information on share repurchase activity

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

auto loan receivables 

as of february 28 2015 and 2014 all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved primarily through asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and floatingrate securities our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies other r eceivables are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities 

composition of auto loan receivables 

  



  





  

interest rate exposure 

we have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility substantially all of these borrowing s are floatingrate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates woul d have decreased our fiscal 2015 net earnings per share by less than 001 we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our term loan however the floating rate risk is mitigated by a derivative instrument 

borrowings under our warehouse facilit ies are also floating rate debt and are secured by auto loan receivables on which we collect interest at fixed rates the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement this floatingrate risk is mitigated by funding the receivables through a term securitization or other funding arrangement and by entering into derivative instruments  absent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk a 100basis point increase in market interest rates associated with the warehouse facilities would have decreased our fiscal 2015 net earnings per share by approximately 00 3  

  

other market exposures 

our pension plan has interest rate risk related to its projected benefit obligation pbo due to the relatively young overall age of the plan’s participants a 100basis point change in the discount rate has approximately a 20 effect on the pbo ba lance a 100basis point decrease in the discount rate would have decreased our fiscal 2015 net earnings per share by less than 001 see note 10 for more information on our benefit plans 

  

as our cashsettled restricted stock units are liability awards the   related compensation expense is sensitive to changes in the company’s stock price the marktomark et effect on the liability depends on each award’s grant price and previously recognize d expense at february 28 2015  a 100 change in the company’s stock price would have affected fiscal 2015 net earnings per share by   less   than 001

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background carmax inc was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax superstore in richmond virginia on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company 

carmax business we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through carmax superstores 

carmax sales operations  we are the nation’s largest retailer of used cars based on the 526929 used vehicles we retailed during the fiscal year ended february 28 2014 as of the end of fiscal 2014 we operated 131 used car 

 

superstores in 64 metropolitan markets in addition we are one of the nation’s largest wholesale vehicle auction operators based on the 342576 wholesale vehicles we sold through our onsite auctions in fiscal 2014 

we were the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality used vehicles at low “nohaggle” prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility our consumer offer allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers we provide low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified vehicles and superior customer service our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems 

our consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process  including the purchase of a vehicle the financing of that vehicle the purchase of extended service plans for that vehicle and the sale of the customer’s current vehicle to carmax customers can m ake informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options terms and associated prices of each component and can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer our nohaggle pricing and our commission structure which is generally based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard allow sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

all of the used vehicles we retail are thoroughly reconditioned to meet our high standards and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale in fiscal 2014  8 5  o f the used vehicles we retailed were 0 to 6 years old 

vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for independent used car dealers as of february 28 2014 we conducted weekly or biweekly auctions at 60 of our 131 used car superstores 

in addition we sell new vehicles at four locations under franchise agreements with three new car manufacturers in fiscal 2014 new vehicles comprised only 1 of our total retail vehicle unit sales 

our finance program provides customers financing alternatives through caf our own finance operation and thirdparty financing providers this program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum we believe the company’s processes and systems transparency of pricing vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit provide a unique and ideal environment in which to originate and procure high quality auto loans caf originates loans solely through carmax stores customizing its offers based on the customer’s risk profile    to   suppor t carmax retail vehicle unit sales all of the finance offers by caf and our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3 ‑day payoff offer whereby a customer can refinance their loan within three business days at no charge 

we provide customers with a range of other related products and services including the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers the sale of extended service plans “esp” and guaranteed asset protection “gap” and vehicle repair service 

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make an offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory through our instore appraisal process we also acquire a large portion of our used vehicle inventory through wholesale auctions and to a lesser extent directly from other sources including wholesalers dealers and fleet owners 

our proprietary inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process using the information provided by this system and applying statistical modeling techniques we are able to optimize our inventory mix anticipate future inventory needs at each store evaluate sales consultant and buyer performance and refine our vehicle pricing strategy because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and pricing system generally more tha n 99  of the entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

  

 

carmax auto finance  caf provides financing to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at carmax because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers caf offers financing solely to customers purchasing vehicles at carmax  caf offer s qualifying customers an array of competitive rates and terms allowing them to choose the one that best fits their needs we believe caf enables us to capture additional sales profits and cash flows while managing our reliance on thirdparty finance sources after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 41  of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2014 as of february 28 2014 caf serviced approximately 532000 cu stomer accounts in its  718 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

industry and competition carmax sales operations  the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive according to industry sources as of december 31 2013  there were approximately 17900 franchised automotive dealerships which sell both new and used vehicles in addition used vehicles were sold by approximately 37000 independent used vehicle dealers as well as millions of private individuals our primary retail competitors are the franchised auto dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles independent used car dealers predominantly sell older higher mileage cars than we do the number of franchised and independent auto dealers has declined over the last decade in large part due to manufacturers’ franchise and brand terminations as well as dealership closures caused by the stress of the recession despite this reduction in the number of dealers the automotive retail environment remains highly fragmented 

based on industry data there were approximately 3 9 million used cars sold in the us in calendar year 2013  of which approximately 2 2 million were estimated to be 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us selling more than two times as many used vehicles as the next largest retailer in calendar 2013 we represented approximately 5  of the 0   to 10year old used units sold in the markets in which we operate and less than 3 of the total 0 to 10year old used units sold nationwide  over the last several years competition has been affected by the increasing use of internetbased marketing for both used vehicles and vehicle financing we seek to distinguish ourselves from traditional dealerships through our consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies 

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our low nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available both on site and via our website carmaxcom the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems caf and the locations of our retail super stores in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides us a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our large volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that don’t meet our retail standards upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfer fees may apply depending on the distance the vehicle needs to travel in fiscal 201 4  approximately 30 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request every vehicle we offer for sale is carmax quality certified and meets our stringent standards we back every vehicle with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty we maintain an ability to offer or arrange customer financing with competitive terms and all financing is backed by our 3 ‑day payoff offer additionally we offer comprehensive and competitively priced esp and gap products we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas and that we enjoy advantages over competitors that employ traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques 

our sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid a commission generally based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the gross profit on the vehicle being sold in addition sales consultants do not receive commissions based on the number of credit approvals or the amount a customer finances this pay structure aligns our sales associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

in our wholesale auctions we compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast with the highly fragmented used vehicle market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc representing an estimated 70 of the us whole car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax predominantly sells older higher mileage vehicles we believe the principal competitive advantages of our wholesale auctions include our high vehicle sales rate our vehicle condition disclosures and arbitration policies our broad geographic distribution and our dealerfriendly practices because we own the cars that we auction we generally sell more than 9 5  of the 

 

vehicles offered which is substantially higher than the sales rate at most other auto auctions our policy of making vehicle condition disclosures noting mechanical and other issues found during our appraisal process is also not a typical practice used at other auctions of older higher mileage vehicles together these factors make our auctions attractive to dealers resulting in a high dealertocar attendance ratio 

carmax auto finance  caf operates in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies according to industry sources t his sector represented approximately  800 bi llion in outstanding receivables as of december 31 201 3  as of february 28 2014 caf had  718 billion in managed receivables having originated  418 billion in loans during the fiscal year for loans originated during the calendar quarter ended december 31 2013  industry sources ranked caf 7th in market share for used vehicle loans and 17th in market share for all vehicle loans 

we believe that caf’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source in carmax stores we believe the company’s processes and systems transparency of pricing vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely through carmax stores scoring models are optimized for the carmax channel 

caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing cars from dealers some of our customers have already obtained financing prior to shopping for a vehicle and do not apply for financing in the store w e also offer customers the ability to pay off their loans within three days without penalty the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our rates 

marketing and advertising our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmaxcom and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle our marketing strategies are implemented primarily through traditional and digital methods including national and local television and radio broadcasts carmaxcom internet search engines and online classified listings we also reach out to customers and potential customers to build awareness and loyalty through facebook twitter and other social media television and radio advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer broadcast and internet advertisements are designed to drive customers to our stores and to carmaxcom we also build awareness and driv e traffic to our stores and carmaxcom by listing retail vehicles on various online automotive classified sites our advertising on the internet also includes advertisements on search engines such as google and yahoo as well as online properties such as pandora and hulu 

we strive to adjust our marketing programs in response to the evolving media landscape we have customized our marketing program based on awareness levels in each market we have transitioned a portion of our television and radio advertising to national cable network and national radio programming and we will continue to seek to optimize our media mix between local and national distribution in addition to providing cost savings this transition allows us to build awareness of carmax prior to our entrance into new markets our carmaxcom website and related mobile apps are marketing tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail sophisticated search engine s for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to initiate   part of the shopping and sales process online the website and mobile apps offer complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated several times per day carmaxcom includes detailed information such as vehicle photos prices features specifications and store locations as well as advanced featurebased search capabilities and sorting and comparison tools that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and email alerts when new inventory arrives customers can contact sales consultants in a variety of ways including online via carmaxcom customers can also schedule appointments hold a vehicle for up to seven days and initiate a vehicle transfer using online tools    our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2014 approximately 80 of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online 

we also maintain a website carmaxauctionscom that supports our wholesale auctions this website which is accessible only by authorized dealers provides listings of all vehicles that will be available in upcoming auctions it also has many features similar to our retail website including vehicle photos free vehicle history reports and vehicle search and alert capabilities 

 

suppliers for used vehicles we acquire used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process as well as through other sources including local regional and online auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the supply of latemodel used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the rate of new vehicle sales which in turn generate usedcar tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions 

during the recession retail vehicle sales dropped sharply with new car sales falling from between 16 million and 17 million vehicles to 10 million vehicles and used car sales falling from between 40 million to 45 million vehicles to 35 million vehicles in 2009 this decline in new car sales combined with a decrease in lease originations and a reduction in tradein activity resulted in a tighter supply of latemodel used vehicles in recent years    t he number of vehicles in operation that were 0 to 6 years old fell from approximately 100 million vehicles prior to the recession to approximately 77 million vehicles as of december 31 2013 new vehicle industry sales and leasing activity have improved in recent years and we anticipate these improvements will gradually increase the supply of latemodel used vehicles 

our used vehicle inventory acquired directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the consumer preferences in each market we have replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which a carmaxtrained buyer appraises a customer’s vehicle and provides the owner with a written guaranteed offer that is good for seven days   an appraisal is available to every customer free of charge whether or not the customer purchases a vehicle from us based on their age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this instore appraisal process meet our highquality retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions 

the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers who handle both onsite appraisals and offsite auction purchases our buyers evaluate all used vehicles based on internal and external auction data and market sales as well as estimated reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases transportation costs our buyers in collaboration with our home office staff utilize the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system to decide which inventory to purchase at offsite auctions our inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross profit per unit 

based on consumer acceptance of the instore appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

suppliers for new vehicles our new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales service and dealer agreements among other things these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies 

seasonality historically our business has been seasonal typically our superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter when used vehicles generally experience proportionately more of their annual depreciation we believe this is partly the result of a decline in customer traffic as well as discounts on model year closeouts that can pressure pricing for latemodel used vehicles customer traffic generally tends to slow in the fall as the weather changes and as customers shift their spending priorities we typically experience an increase in subprime traffic and sales in february and march coincident with tax refund season 

products and services 

merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices our primary focus is vehicles that are 0 to 6 years old and generally range in price from 12000 to 34000 for the more costconscious consumer we also offer used cars that are generally between 7 and 11 years old the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences 

we have implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which we set nohaggle prices on both our used and new vehicles we believe that our pricing is competitive prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each 

 

vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom and on applicable online classified sites on which they are listed we extend our nohaggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction including vehicle appraisal offers financing rates and esp and gap pricing 

wholesale auctions vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions as of february 28 2014 wholesale auctions were conducted at 60 of our 131 superstores and were generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned which depends on the number of stores in that market and the consumer awareness of carmax and our instore appraisal offer the typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles participants in carmax auctions must be licensed automobile dealers  who are required to register with our centralized auction support group the majority of the participants are independent automobile dealers we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions the average auction sales rate was 97  in fiscal 2014 dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase 

  

extended service plans and guaranteed asset protection at the time of the sale we offer the customer an esp we sell these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors w e have no contractual liability to the customer for claims under the service agreements  the esps we offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 72 months subject to mileage limitations and include multiple mileage and deductible options depending on the vehicle odometer reading make and model we offer esps at competitive fixed prices which take into consideration the historical repair record of the vehicle make and mod el the mileage option selected and the deductible chosen all esps that we sell other than manufacturer programs have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements periodically we may receive additional commissions based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products in fiscal 2014 more than 6 0  of the customers who purchased a used vehicle also purchased an esp 

our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the quality of the services provided by this network as well as the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

we also offer gap at the time of the sale gap is a product that will pay the difference between the customer’s insurance settlement and the finance contract payoff amount on their vehicle in the case of a total loss or unrecovered theft we sell this product on behalf of an unrelated third party that is the primary obligor    gap has been designed to our specifications and is administered by the third party through a privatelabel arrangement we receive a commission from the administrator at the time of sale in fiscal 2014 more tha n 25 of customers who purchased a used vehicle also purchased gap 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the renewal process used to make sure every car meets our high standards before it can become a carmax quality certified   vehicle this process includes a comprehensive carmax quality inspection of the engine and all major systems including cooling fuel drivetrain transmission electronics suspension brakes steering air conditioning and other equipment as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle based on this quality inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our quality standards we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services we engage third parties specializing in those services many superstores depend upon nearby typically larger superstores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead 

all carmax used car superstores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by our esps we also provide factoryauthorized service at all new car franchises we have developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that our retail repair service is conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as our other operations 

we believe that the efficiency of our reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by our modern facilities our information systems and our technician training and development process the training and development process and our compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of technicians identify opportunities for waste reduction and achieve highquality repairs our information systems allow us to track repair history and enable trend analysis which guides our continuous improvement efforts 

 

customer credit we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and our arrangements with several industryleading financial institutions we believe our program enables us to capture additional sales and enhances the carmax consumer offer credit applications are initially reviewed by caf customers who are not approved by caf may be evaluated by the other financial institutions having an array of finance sources increases discrete approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax in fiscal 2014 91  of our applicants received an approval from one or more of our sources we periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

retail customers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through our proprietary information system a majority of applicants receive a response within five minutes vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges depending on the credit profile of the customer thirdparty finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract the fee amount is independent of any finance term offered to the customer it does not vary based on the amount financed the term of the loan the interest rate or the loantovalue ratio we refer to the providers who pay us a fee as prime and nonprime providers and we refer to the providers to whom we pay a fee as subprime providers we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers 

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

systems 

our stores are supported by an advanced proprietary information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions customers can search our entire vehicle inventory through our website carmaxcom and our mobile apps they can also print a detailed listing for any vehicle which includes the vehicle’s features and specifications and its location on the display lot our integrated inventory management system tracks every vehicle through its life from purchase through reconditioning and testdrives to ultimate sale using radio frequency identification “rfid” tags and bar codes all vehicles are scanned and tracked daily as a loss prevention measure testdrive information is captured using rfid tags linking the specific vehicle and the sales consultant we also capture data on vehicles we wholesale which helps us track market pricing a computerized finance application process and computerassisted document preparation ensure rapid completion of the sales transaction behind the scenes our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity in addition our store system provides a direct link to our proprietary credit processing information system to facilitate the credit review and approval process 

our proprietary inventory management and pricing system is centralized and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location this system also generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on complex algorithms that take into account factors including sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which minimizes the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit 

our electronic repair order system “ero” is used to sequence reconditioning procedures ero provides information that helps increase quality and reduce costs which further enhances our customer service and profitability 

through our centralized systems we are able to quickly integrate new stores into our store network we continue to enhance and refine our information systems which we believe to be a core competitive advantage the design of our information systems incorporates offsite backups redundant processing and other measures to reduce the risk of significant data loss in the event of an emergency or disaster

vehicle dealer and other laws and regulations we operate in a highly regulated industry in every state in which we operate we must obtain various licenses and permits in order to conduct business including dealer service sales and finance licenses issued by state and local regulatory authorities a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations govern the manner in which we conduct business including advertising sales financing and employment practices these laws include consumer protection laws privacy laws and state franchise laws as well as other laws and regulations applicable to new and used motor vehicle dealers these laws also include federal and state wagehour antidiscrimination and other employment practices laws our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truthinlending consumer leasing equal credit opportunity and fair credit reporting laws and regulations all of which are subject to enforcement by the federal consumer financial protection bureau or federal trade commission as well as state and local motor vehicle finance collection repossession and installment finance laws

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business sales results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 

we operate in a highly competitive industry  failure to develop and execute strategies to remain the nation’s preferred retailer of used vehicles and to adapt to the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

  

automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices new car dealers in particular including publiclytraded auto retailers have increased their sales of used vehicles since the recession if this trend continues it could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected retail sales and margins 

some of our competitors have recently announced plans for rapid expansion including into markets with carmax locations some of our competitors have also borrowed or attempted to borrow portions of the consumer offer that we pioneered when we opened our first used car superstore in 1993 including our use of low nohaggle prices and our commitment to buy a customer’s vehicle even if they do not purchase one from us in addition competitors who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax this competitive activity could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected retail sales and margins 

the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles and to provide vehicle financing could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations the increasing online availability of used vehicle information including pricing information could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines and online classified sites that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for carmaxcom to attract traffic these companies could also make it more difficult for carmax otherwise to market its vehicles online for example by declining to list carmax quality certified vehicles as “certified” on their classified sites this could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the increasing use of the internet to facilitate consumers’ sales or tradeins of their current vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our vehicle acquisition costs and results of operations for example certain websites   provide online appraisal tools to consumers that generate offers and facilitate purchases by dealers other than carmax the popularity of these tools appears to be increasing 

in addition to the direct competition and increasing use of the internet described above there are companies that sell software solutions to new and used car dealers to enable those dealers to among other things more efficiently 

 

source inventory although these companies do not compete with carmax the increasing use of such products by dealers who compete with carmax could reduce the relative competitive advantage of carmax’s internally developed proprietary systems and could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected retail sales and margins 

our wholesale activities are also subject to competition since we sell vehicles that do not meet our retail standards through onsite wholesale auctions our competition includes automotive wholesalers such as manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc these competitors sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we sell in the same or similar markets at competitive prices this competitive activity could result in decreased wholesale margins and could adversely affect our results of operations 

our caf s egment is subject to competition from various financial institutions including banks and credit unions which provide vehicle financing to consumers if we were unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf it could result in a greater percentage of sales financed through our thirdparty financing providers which financings are generally less profitable to carmax in addition we believe that caf allows us to capture additional sales accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance offers to our customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

the automotive retail industry in general and our business in particular are sensitive to economic conditions these conditions could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to national and regional us economic conditions these conditions include but are not limited to recession inflation interest rates unemployment levels the state of the housing market gasoline prices consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general these conditions and the economy in general could be affected by significant national or international events such as acts of terrorism when these economic conditions worsen or stagnate it can have a material adverse effect on consumer demand for vehicles generally including the used vehicles that we sell and the availability of consumer credit to finance vehicle purchases this could result in lower sales decreased margins on units sold and decreased profits for our caf segment worsening or stagnating economic conditions can also have a material adverse effect on the supply of latemodel used vehicles as automotive manufacturers produce fewer new vehicles and consumers retain their current vehicles for longer periods of time this could result in increased costs to acquire used vehicle inventory and decreased margins on units sold 

  

these dynamics were apparent in the difficult us economic environment during the most recent recession  which adversely affected the automotive retail industry in general including carmax while many of these indicators have improved more recently there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so or that improvements will result in benefits to our sales and results of operations any significant change or deterioration in economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

our business is dependent upon capital to fund growth and to support the activities of our caf s egment changes in capital and credit markets could adversely affect our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support our geographic expansion could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth although we have financed recent geographic expansion with internally generated cash flows there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flows to fund growth failure to do so—or our decision to put our cash to other uses—would make us more dependent on external sources of financing to fund our geographic expansion 

changes in the availability or cost of the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loan receivables through caf could adversely affect sales and results of operations we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf initially we sell most of these receivables into our warehouse facilities we periodically refinance receivables through term securitizations changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

 

our revolving credit facility and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants and performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions—especially if coupled with a failure to generate significant cash flows—could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on thirdparty financing providers to finance a significant portion of our customers’ vehicle purchases accordingly our sales and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties 

we provide financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty financing providers if one or more of these thirdparty providers cease to provide financing to our customers provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

carmax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity failure to maintain a reputation of integrity and to otherwise maintain and enhance our brand could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which our reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations such an event could include an isolated incident at a single store particularly if such incident results in adverse publicity governmental investigations or litigation even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results 

the growing use of social media increases the speed with which information and opinions can be shared and thus the speed with which reputation can be affected we monitor social media and attempt to address customer concerns provide accurate information and protect our reputation but there can be no guarantee that our efforts will succeed if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our success depends upon the continued contributions of our more than 20000 associates 

  

our associates are the driving force behind our success we believe that one of the things that sets carmax apart is a culture centered on valuing all associates our failure to maintain this culture or to continue recruiting developing and retaining the associates that drive our success could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates our growth plans changes in employment legislation and competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and for qualified service technicians in particular our ability to recruit associates while controlling related costs is also subject to our ability to maintain positive associate relations if we are unable to do so or if despite our efforts we become subject to successful unionization efforts it could increase costs limit our ability to respond to competitive threats and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

  

our success also depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of any of these associates could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers a breach of this confidentiality whether due to a cybersecurity or other incident could result in harm to our customers and damage to our brand 

 

we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers this information includes the information customers provide when purchasing a vehicle and applying for vehicle financing we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential associate information in the normal course of business and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers although we have taken measures designed to safeguard such information and have received assurances from our thirdparty providers our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty providers could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events several national retailers have recently disclosed security breaches involving sophisticated cyberattacks which were not recognized or detected until after such retailers had been affected notwithstanding the preventive measures such retailers had in place any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or associate information whether experienced by us or by our thirdparty service providers and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident a programming error or other cause could damage our reputation expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement disrupt our business and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition our failure to respond quickly and appropriately to such a security breach could exacerbate the consequences of the breach 

our business is sensitive to changes in the prices of new and used vehicles 

any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations for example if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations and could result in decreased used margins manufacturer incentives could contribute to narrowing this price gap in addition any significant changes in wholesale prices for used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations by reducing wholesale margins 

our business is dependent upon access to vehicle inventory obstacles to acquiring inventory—whether because of supply competition or other factors—or a failure to expeditiously liquidate that inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations although the supply of latemodel used vehicles appears to be increasing recently there can be no assurance that this trend will continue or that it will benefit carmax 

we source a significant percentage of our vehicles though our appraisal process and these vehicles are generally more profitable for carmax accordingly if we fail to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or fail to recognize those trends it could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory it could also force us to purchase a greater percentage of our inventory from thirdparty auctions which is generally less profitable for carmax our ability to source vehicles through our appraisal process could also be affected by competition both from new and used car dealers directly and through thirdparty websites driving appraisal traffic to those dealers see the risk factor above titled “ we operate in a highly competitive industry ” for discussion of this risk 

used vehicle inventory is subject to depreciation risk accordingly if we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate such inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations changes in these laws and regulations or our failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

  

we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations our sale of used vehicles is subject to state and local licensing requirements federal and state laws regulating vehicle advertising and state laws regulating vehicle sales and service our provision of vehicle financing is subject to federal and state laws regulating the provision of consumer finance our facilities and business operations are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety in addition to these laws and regulations that apply specifically to our business we are also subject to laws and regulations affecting public companies and large employers generally including federal employment practices securities and tax laws for additional discussion of these laws and regulations see the section of this form 10k titled “ laws and regulations ” 

 

the violation of any of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against our business operations any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations 

recent federal legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms may result in an increase in expenses or a decrease in revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” regulates among other things the provision of consumer financing the doddfrank act established a new consumer financial protection agency the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” with broad regulatory powers the cfpb is responsible for administering and enforcing laws and regulations related to consumer financial products and services the evolving regulatory environment in the wake of the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb may increase the cost of regulatory compliance or result in changes to business practices that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as it is phased in over time significantly affects the provision of health care services and will increase the costs we incur to provide our associates with health coverage current federal labor policy could lead to increased unionization efforts which could increase labor costs disrupt store operations and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities continue to scrutinize advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced see the risk factor titled “ we operate in a highly competitive industry ” for discussion of this risk 

we are a growth retailer our failure to manage our growth and the related challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business  sales and results of operations 

the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our information systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations the expansion of our store base also requires us to recruit and retain the associates necessary to support that expansion see the risk factor above titled “ our success depends upon the continued contributions of our more than 20000 associates ” for discussion of this risk the expansion of our store base also requires real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are forced to curtail or stop growth as we did during the recession it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we rely on sophisticated information systems to run our business the failure of these systems   could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to manage sales inventory our customerfacing websites carmaxcom and carmaxauctionscom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain or update these systems as necessary could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

in addition despite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems we could be subjected to attacks by hackers including denialofservice attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations see the risk factor above titled “ we collect sensitive confidential information from our customers ” for the risks associated with a breach of confidential customer or associate information 

we are subject to numerous legal proceedings if the outcomes of these proceedings are adverse to carmax it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to various litigation matters from time to time which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law 

 

could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these claims could be asserted under a variety of laws including but not limited to consumer finance laws consumer protection laws intellectual property laws privacy laws labor and employment laws securities laws and employee benefit laws these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including but not limited to suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

our business is sensitive to conditions affecting automotive manufacturers 

adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations and could impact the supply of vehicles including the supply of latemodel used vehicles in addition manufacturer recalls are a common occurrence recalls could adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of a recalled vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

our results of operations and financial condition are subject to management’s accounting judgments and estimates as well as changes in accounting policies 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of carmax’s assets liabilities revenues earnings and expenses if these estimates or assumptions are incorrect it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require us to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8  

the implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 

our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

our business is sensitive to weather events 

the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes extended periods of unusually cold weather or natural disasters could cause store closures or affect the timing of consumer demand either of which could adversely affect consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

we are subject to local conditions in the geographic areas in which we are concentrated 

our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us including florida and in texas southern california and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experienced a downturn in economic conditions it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations

 item 2 properties 

we conduct our retail vehicle operations in two basic formats – production and nonproduction superstores production superstores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production superstores have more service bays and require additional space for workinprocess inventory and   therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction superstore on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some superstores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction superstores until we expand our presence in that market as of february   2 8    20 14  we op erated 73 production superstores and 58 nonproduction superstores 

as of february 28 2014 we operated 60 wholesale auctions most of which were located at production superstores stores at which auctions are conducted generally have additional space to store wholesale inventory as of february 28 2014 we also operated one new car store which was located adjacent to our used car superstore in laurel maryland our remaining three new car franchises are operated as part of our used car superstores 

production superstores are generally on 10 to 25 acres  but a few range from 20 to 35 acres and nonproduction superstores are generally on 4 to 12 acres 

used car superstores as of february 28 2014 

  



  

 

as of february 28  20 14  we leased 5 7 of our 131   used car super stores  our new car store and our caf office building in atlanta georgia we owned the remaining 74 stores currently in operation we also own ed our home office building in richmond v irginia and land associated with planned future store openings   

expansion 

since opening our first used car superstore in 1993 we have grown organically through the construction and opening of companyoperated stores we do not franchise our operations as of february 28 2014 we operated 131 used car superstores in 64 us markets which represented approximately 57 of the us population we believe that further geographic expansion and additional fillin opportunities in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth 

in december 2008 we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment we resumed store growth in fiscal 2011 opening 3 superstores that year 5 superstores in fiscal 2012   10 superstores in fiscal 2013 and 13 superstores in fiscal 2014 we currently plan to open 13 superstores in fiscal 2015 and between 10 and 15 in each of the following two fiscal years

the claims currently remaining in the lawsuit regarding the sales consultant putative class are 1 failure to provide meal and rest breaks or compensation in lieu thereof 2 failure to pay wages of terminated or resigned employees related to meal and rest breaks 3 unfair competition and 4 california’s labor code private attorney general act on june 16 2009 the court entered a stay of these claims pending the outcome of a california supreme court case involving unrelated third parties but related legal issues subsequently carmax moved to lift the stay and compel the plaintiffs’ remaining claims into arbitration on an individual basis which the court granted on november 21 2011 the plaintiffs appealed the court’s ruling to the california court of appeal on march 26 2013 the california court of appeal reversed the trial court’s order granting carmax’s motion to compel arbitration on october 8 2013 carmax filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review in the united states supreme court   on february 24 2014 the united states supreme court granted carmaxs petition for certiorari vacated the california court of appeal decision and remanded the case to the california court of appeal for further consideration the fowler lawsuit seeks compensatory and spe cial damages wages interest civil and statutory penalties restitution injunctive relief and the recovery of attorneys’ fees we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters 

the company is a class member in a consolidated and settled class action lawsuit  in re toyota motor corp unintended acceleration marketing sales practices and products liability litig  case no 102151 cd cal consolidated as of april 9 2010 against toyota motor corp and toyota motor sales usa inc collectively “toyota” related to the economic loss associated with certain toyota vehicles equipped with electronic throttle controls systems and the potential unintended acceleration of these vehicles on april 3 2014 the claims administrator in this matter provided notice to the company that the company may recover approximately 20 million net of attorney’s fees and expenses as its share of the settlement proceeds in the third calendar quarter of 

 

2014 the estimated recovery 1 may be reduced to the extent that the total claims made exceed the settlement pool 2 is subject to final approval of supporting documentation and 3 remains subject to the entry of a final approval order from the district court judge we will recognize these proceeds when funds are received from the claims administrator 

  

we are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business based upon our evaluation of information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect either individually or in the aggregate on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

business overview 

general 

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through carmax superstores 

we pioneered the used car superstore concept opening our first store in 1993 our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems as of february 28 2014 we operated 131 used car superstores in 64 markets comprising 46 midsized markets 1 5 large markets and 3 small markets we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000 and 25 million people we also operated four new car franchises during fiscal 2014 we sold 526929 used cars representing 9 9  of the total 534690 v ehicles we sold at retail 

we believe the carmax consumer offer is distinctive within the auto retailing marketplace our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other big box retailers our consumer offer features low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service our website carmaxcom and related mobile apps are valuable tools for communicating the carmax consumer offer as well as sophisticated search engines and efficient channels for customers who prefer to start their shopping online our financial results are driven by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing extended service plans “esps” a guaranteed asset protection “gap” product and vehicle repair service  gap is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft 

we seek to build customer satisfaction by offering highquality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions vehicles repossessed and liquidated by caf are also generally sold through our wholesale auctions wholesale auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis and as of february 28 2014 we conducted auctions at 60 used car superstores during fiscal 2014 we sold 342576 wholesale vehicles on average the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers 

we sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors as of february 28 201 4  the used vehicle thirdparty esp providers were cna national warranty corporation and the warranty group and the thirdparty gap provider was safeguard products international llc esp revenue represents commissions earned on the sale of esps and gap from the unrelated third parties 

we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf and our arrangements with several industryleading financial institutions as of february 28 2014 these third parties included santander consumer usa wells fargo dealer services capital one auto finance american credit acceptance westlake financial services and exeter finance corp  depending on the credit profile of the customer the thirdparty finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract the fee amount is independent of any finance term offered to the customer it does not vary based on the amount financed the term of the loan the interest rate or the loantovalue ratio we refer to the thirdparty providers who pay us a fee as prime and nonprime providers and we refer to the providers to whom we pay a fee as subprime providers we have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers  

 

we offer financing through caf to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at carmax caf utilizes proprietary customized scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment caf offers customers an array of competitive rates and terms allowing them to choose the ones that best fit their needs in addition customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract with caf or a thirdparty provider within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges we randomly test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates 3day payoffs and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 41 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2014 as of february 28 2014 caf serviced approximately 532000 customer accounts in its 718 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

over the long term we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base we also believe that increased used vehicle unit sales will drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and over time increased caf income we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price  

in december 2008 we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment we resumed store growth in fiscal 2011 opening 3 superstores in that year 5 superstores in fiscal 2012 10 superstores in fiscal 2013 and 13 superstores in fiscal 2014 we currently plan to open 13 superstores in fiscal 2015 and between 10 and 15 superstores in   each of the following two fiscal years  while we currently have more than 130 superstores we are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 2 8  201 4  we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 57 of the us population 

the principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to hire qualified associates and build our management bench strength to support our store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at favorable terms we staff each newly opened store with associates who have extensive carmax training  therefore w e must recruit train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings 

fiscal 2014 highlights 















  



  

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving securitization program composed of two warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations as secured borrowings which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses  

auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through caf the receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance 

se e notes 2f 2i and 4 for additional inf ormation on securitizations and auto loan receivables 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5 ‑day moneyback guarantee we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends  and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties  who are the primary obligors to customers who purchase a vehicle the esps we offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 72 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale net of a reserve for estimated customer cancellations periodically we may receive additional commissions based upon the level of underwriting profits of the third parties who administer the products these additional commissions are recognized as revenue when received the reserve for cancellations is evaluated for each product and is based on forecasted forward cancellation curves utilizing historical experience recent trends and credit mix of the customer base our risk related to customer cancellations is limited to the commissions that we receive cancellations fluctuate depending on the volume of esp and gap sales customer financing default or prepayment rates and shifts in customer behavior related to changes in the coverage or term of the product results could be affected if actual events differ from our estimates a 10 change in the estimated cancellation rates would have changed cancellation reserves by approximately  72 million as of february 28 2014 see note 8 for additional information on cancellation reserves 

customers applying for financing who are not approved by caf may be evaluated by other financial institutions depending on the credit profile of the customer thirdparty finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we recognize these fees at the time of sale 

 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted  see note 9 for additional information on income taxes 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider available carrybacks future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 28 2014 will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 the 18 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2014 resulted from a corresponding increase in used unit sales the increase in unit sales included a 12 increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store used unit growth was primarily driven by improved conversion as well as a modest increase in store traffic we believe the strong conversion reflected continued improvements in execution in our stores and the attractive credit environment experienced during fiscal 2014 

our data indicates that in our markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by approximately 1 6  in fiscal 2014 we believe our ability to grow market share year after year is a reflection of the strength of our consumer offer the skill of our associates and the preference for our brand  

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 the 12 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2013 resulted from a 10 increase in used unit sales and a 2 increase in average retail selling price the increase in used unit sales included a 5 increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store unit growth was driven by improved conversion which we believe benefited from a variety of factors including more compelling credit offers from thirdparty finance providers and caf increased inventory selection and continued strong instore execution 

the increase in average retail selling price primarily reflected changes in our sales mix by vehicle age with an increased mix of ages 02 vehicles and a reduced mix of ages 34 vehicles which corresponds to the model years in shortest supply the overall supply of latemodel used vehicles being remarketed has been constrained following four years of new car industry sales at rates significantly below prerecession levels during much of the period from 2009 through 2011 wholesale vehicle industry values rose which increased our vehicle acquisition costs and average selling prices compared with prerecession periods we believe the constrained supply of latemodel used vehicles and the resulting increase in 

 

selling prices had an adverse effect on our used vehicle sales in recent years as new car industry sales return to historical levels the supply of latemodel used vehicles should gradually improve which we believe will benefit our business 

our data indicated that in our markets we increased our share of the 0 to 10year old used vehicle market by approximately 7 in fiscal 2013 

wholesale vehicle sales 

our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles bought through our appraisal process and sold in our auctions 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 the 4 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2014 resulted from a 5 increase in wholesale unit sales partially offset by a 2 reduction in average wholesale vehicle selling price the wholesale unit growth primarily reflected the growth in our store base as well as an increase in the appraisal buy rate however we experienced a reduced mix of wholesale vehicles in our appraisal traffic that partially offset the benefit of our store growth and increased buy rate 

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 the 2 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2013 resulted from a 3 increase in wholesale unit sales offset by a slight reduction in average wholesale vehicle selling price the wholesale unit growth included the combined effects of the growth in our store base and higher appraisal traffic offset by a lower appraisal buy rate the modest growth in wholesale unit sales also reflected the challenging comparisons with fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 when wholesale unit sales grew 20 and 33 respectively 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of esps and gap   collectively reported in esp revenues   net of a reserve for estimated customer cancellations service department sales and   net thirdparty finance fees the fixed pervehicle fees paid to us by prime and nonprime thirdparty finance providers may vary  reflecting the providers’ differing levels of credit risk exposure the fixed pervehicle fees that we pay to the subprime providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from prime and nonprime providers  in previous years the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by subprime providers excluded sales associated with a thirdparty referral program these sales are now included in this percentage for current and prior periods 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 other sales and revenues declined 6 in fiscal 2014 reflecting a reduction in net thirdparty finance fees and only modest growth in esp revenue the decrease in net thirdparty finance fees was driven by a mix shift among providers including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by the subprime providers to 19 in fiscal 2014 versus 16 in fiscal 2013 throughout fiscal 2013 and for most of fiscal 2014 the volume and share of financing originated by the thirdparty subprime providers increased on a yearoveryear basis as these providers made more attractive offers to customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 however the subprime providers moderated their credit offerings and as a result their share of financings for the fourth quarter was flat with fiscal 2013 

during fiscal 2014 we corrected our accounting related to cancellation reserves for esp and gap with resulting increases in reserves related to activity for fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 the portion of the increase in reserves related to prior fiscal years totaled 195 million the effect of the increase in the cancellation reserve s largely offset the growth in esp revenues resulting from our increase in used unit sales and a higher esp penetration rate 

  

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 other sales and revenues declined 2 in fiscal 2013 as an increase in esp revenues was more than offset by a decrease in net thirdparty finance fees esp revenues increased 13 primarily reflecting the growth in our retail vehicle unit sales and an increase in esp penetration the decrease in net thirdparty finance fees was driven by a mix shift among providers including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by the subprime providers to 16 in fiscal 2013 versus 10 in fiscal 2012 the growth in the subprime sales mix primarily resulted from more compelling credit offers being made by the subprime providers 

  

 

  

gross profit 

  



  

  

gross profit per unit 

  



  

  1 calculated as category gross profit divided by its respective units sold except the other and total categories which are divided by total retail units sold 

2 calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue 

  

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and our frequent inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit 

we employ a volumebased strategy and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction over the past several years we have been able to manage to a relatively consistent used vehicle gross profit per unit 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 used vehicle gross profit increased 18 in fiscal 2014 driven by the corresponding increase in used unit sales used vehicle gross profit per unit remained consistent at 2171 in fiscal 2014 versus 2170 in fiscal 2013 

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 used vehicle gross profit increased 9 in fiscal 2013 driven primarily by the 10 increase in used unit sales used vehicles gross profit per unit was only marginally lower averaging 2170 in fiscal 2013 versus 2177 in fiscal 2012 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

o ur wholesale gross profit per unit reflects the demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions   the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 2 in fiscal 2014 with the 5 increase in wholesale unit sales partially offset by a 3 reduction in wholesale gross profit per unit which moderated to 916 in fiscal 2014 compared with 949 in fiscal 2013 

 

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 2 in fiscal 2013 driven by the 3 increase in wholesale unit sales wholesale gross profit per unit was relatively stable declining only 4 per unit 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to esp and gap revenues net thirdparty finance fees and service department operations including used vehicle reconditioning we have no cost of sales related to esp and gap revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent commissions paid to us by certain thirdparty providers  thirdparty finance fees are reported net of the fees we pay to thirdparty subprime finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 other gross profit increased 4 in fiscal 2014 as higher service department gross profits and a modest increase in esp gross profit  was largely offset by the reduction in net thirdparty finance fees esp gross profit was reduced by our correction in accounting related to cancellation reserves for esp and gap service department gross profit rose 273 million in fiscal 2014 primarily due to increases in gross profit associated with used vehicle reconditioning which benefited from strong used unit sales growth   and the resulting leverage of service overhead costs  

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 other gross profit declined 1 in fiscal 2013 as improved service department and esp profits were more than offset by the lower net thirdparty finance fees 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not had a significant impact on results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices however increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit caf income to the extent the average amount financed also increases 

in the years following the recession we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing we believe the appreciation resulted in part from a reduced supply of latemodel used vehicles in the market  this reduced supply was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle tradein activity compared with prerecession periods the higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our used vehicle average selling prices  which climbed from 16291 in fiscal 2009 to 19408 in fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we also experienced inflationary increases in key reconditioning costs

  1 excludes compensation and benefits related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service which is included in cost of sales 

2 includes it expenses insurance bad debt travel preopening and relocation costs charitable contributions and other administrative expenses 

  

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 sga expenses increased 12 in fiscal 2 01 4 the increase reflected the 11  increase in our store base during fiscal 201 4 representing the addition of 1 3 stores and higher variable selling costs resulting from the 12  increase in comparable store used unit sales sga per retail unit declined 102 to 2161 versus 2263 in fiscal 2013 as our comparable store used unit sales growth generated overhead leverage  

 

  

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 sga expenses increased 10 in fiscal 2013 the increase primarily reflected the combination of the 9 expansion in our store base during fiscal 2013 representing the addition of 10 stores higher variable selling costs resulting from the 5 increase in comparable store used unit sales and higher growthrelated costs growthrelated costs include store preopening expenses relocation expenses and the costs of maintaining store management bench strength to support future growth growthrelated costs were affected by the increase in the rate of our store openings from 5 stores in fiscal 2012 to 10 stores in fiscal 2013 sga per retail unit was consistent at 2263 in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 382  in fiscal 2014 381 in fiscal 2013 and 380 in fiscal 2012 

  

results of operations – carmax auto finance 

caf provides financing to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at carmax because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers while financing can also be obtained from thirdparty sources we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk  furthermore we believe the company’s processes and systems   transparency of pricing vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans bot h for caf and for the thirdparty finance providers 

we believe caf enables us to capture additional sales profits and cash flows while managing our reliance on third   party finance sources management regularly analyzes cafs operating results by assessing the competitiveness of our consumer offer profitability the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses 

caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expense s caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs while caf benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures we have elected to present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefits or costs that could be attributed to caf examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources administrative services marketing information systems accounting legal treasury and executive payroll 

  

components of caf income

caf o rigination i nformation 

  



  

  1 all information relates to loans originated net of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns 

2 vehicle units financed as a percentage of total retail units sold 

  

fiscal 2014 versus fiscal 2013 caf income increas ed 12 to 3362 million from  2993 million in fiscal 2013 the improvement resulted from the growth in caf’s managed receivables partially offset by a lower total interest margin rate 

  

caf’s average managed receivables increased 23 to 663 billion in fiscal 2014 driven by the growth in caf net loan originations  which rose 21 to 418 billion  origination volumes benefited from an increase in caf’s loan penetration rate which grew steadily from its recent low of 30 in fiscal 2011 to 41 in fiscal 2014  and the growth in the company’s retail unit sales the improvement in the loan penetration rate over this period reflected a combination of factors  including a transition back to caf’s prerecession origination strategy during fiscal 2012 and favorable responses to changes in our credit offers the transition back to caf’s prerecession origination strategy reduced the volume of finance contracts we had been selling to thirdparty providers in midfiscal 2013 we began strategically providing more competitive offers see note 4 for additional information on the credit quality of caf’s auto loan receivables 

  

total interest margin which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs declined to 69 of average managed receivables in fiscal 2014 compared with 74 in fiscal 2013 strategically p roviding more competitive offers contributed to a decline in the weighted average contract rate on loan originations to 70 in fiscal 2014 from 79 in fiscal 2013 changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time as these loans come to represent an increasing percentage of managed receivables rising interest rates which affect caf’s funding costs or further competitive pressures on consumer rates could result in further compression in the interest margin on new originations 

the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance in fiscal 2014 the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average managed receivables increased slightly to 109 from 104 in fiscal 2013 

allowance for loan losses 

  



  

  1 percent of total ending managed receivables as of the corresponding reporting date 

  

the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we consider recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the economic environment in determining the adequacy of the allowance the increase in the dollar amount of the allowance largely reflected the growth in managed receivables the allowance for loan losses as a percent of managed receivables was flat at 097 as of both february 28 2014 and february 28 2013 

 

past due account information 

  



  

credit loss information 

  



  

as of february 28 2014 past due accounts were 258 of ending managed receivables consistent with the 260 delinquency rate as of february 28 2013 net credit losses increased to 090 of average managed receivables in fiscal 2014 from 078 in fiscal 2013 

the average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated generally at our wholesale auctions the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42 to a high of 60 and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment 

loan origination test  in january 2014 caf launched a test originating loans for customers who typically would be financed by our subprime providers we plan to originate approximately 70 million of loans in this test of which 91 million was originated in fiscal 2014 we expect the loans originated in this test will have higher loss and delinquency rates than the aggregate of the current caf portfolio the test will be funded separately from our current portfolio and not included in our current securitization program 

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 caf income increased 14 to 2993 million from 2622 million in fiscal 2012 primarily reflecting the growth in managed receivables despite the growth in our receivables direct expenses decreased modestly as we benefited from operating efficiencies 

caf’s average managed receivables increased 16 to 539 billion in fiscal 2013 driven by the growth in caf origination volume throughout fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 origination volumes benefited from an increase in caf’s loan penetration rate increased ave rage retail selling prices which translated into an increase in the average amount financed and the growth in retail unit sales additionally historically low funding costs allowed caf to begin offering more compelling credit offers in the second half of fiscal 2013 positive customer response to these credit offers further bolstered caf origination volumes 

total interest margin was 74 of average managed receivables in fiscal 2013 similar to the 73 interest margin in fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2013 the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average managed receivables increased moderately to 104 compared with 078 in fiscal 2012 low unit chargeoffs and strong recovery rates continued to partially offset the effect of the change in credit mix resulting from the transition in our origination strategy the allowance for loan losses increased to 097 of ending managed receivables as of february 28 2013 versus 087 as of february 29 2012 

  

 

planned future activities 

  

we plan to open a total of 13 superstores in fiscal 2015 and between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following two fiscal years we currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately 325 million in fiscal 2015 

fiscal 2015 planned superstore openings

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations new store expansion including capital expenditures and inventory purchas es and caf  our p rimary ongoing sources of liquidity include existing cash balances funds provided by operations proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

operating activities  net cash used in operating activities totaled 6132 million in fiscal 2014 7784 million in fiscal 2013 and 622 million in fiscal 2012 these amounts included increases in auto loan receivables of 132 billion 9922 million and 6757 million respectively the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are separately reflected as cash provided by financing activities excluding the increases in auto loan receivables net cash provided by operating activities would have been 7110 million in fiscal 2014 2138 million in fiscal 2013 and 6135 million i n fiscal 2012 

as of february 28 2014 total inventory was 164 billion representing an increase of 1236 million or 8 compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year we had 7 more used vehicles in inventory as of february 28 2014 compared with the start of the fiscal year reflecting the addition of inventory associated with the 13 stores opened during fiscal 2014 as well as added inventories to support our comparable store sales growth inventory levels were somewhat below target levels as of the end of fiscal 2014 however largely due to disruptions in reconditioning activities caused by unusually severe weather experienced during the fourth quarter of the year 

as of february 28 2013 total inventory was 152 billion representing an increase of 4252 million or 39 compared with the balance as of the start of the fiscal year we had 35 more used vehicles in inventory as of february 28 2013 compared with the start of the fiscal year the additional used vehicle units supported the ten stores opened during fiscal 2013 and our comparable store sales growth in addition during the second half of fiscal 

 

2013 we built inventories at a higher rate than in recent years to better position ourselves for seasonal sales opportunities 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled 3367 million in fiscal 2014 2553 million in fiscal 2013 and 2194 million in fiscal 2012 investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled 3103 million in fiscal 2014 2357 million in fiscal 2013 and 1726 million in fiscal 2012 capital expenditures primarily include real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store construction costs we maintain a multiyear pipeline of sites to support our superstore growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we plan to open in subsequent fiscal years the increases in capital expenditures over the last three fiscal years primarily related to the growth in our store opening pace as we increased store openings from 5 in fiscal 2012 to 10 in fiscal 2013 and 13 in fiscal 2014 

historically capital expenditures have been funded with internallygenerated funds debt and saleleaseback transactions no saleleasebacks have been executed since fiscal 2009 

as of february 28 2014 we owned 74 and leased 5 7 of our 131 used car superstores 

restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables increased 350 million in fiscal 2014 200 million in fiscal 2013 and 433 million in fiscal 2012 these collections vary depending on the timing of the receipt of principal and interest payments on securitized auto loan receivables the change in average managed receivables and the funding vehicle utilized 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled 113 billion in fiscal 2014 104 billion in fiscal 2013 and 6831 million in fiscal 2012 included in these amounts were net increases in total nonrecourse notes payable of 139 billion 117 billion and 6704 million respectively which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of 132 billion 9922 million and 6757 million respectively in auto loan receivables during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 net cash provided by financing activities was reduced by stock repurchases of 3072 million and 2034 million respectively 

total debt and cash and cash equivalents 

  



  

we have a 700 million unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in august 201 6 borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us see note 11 for additional information on the revolving credit facility 

the credit facility agreement contains representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements were not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity 

caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles  even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables  we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles  

the timing of principal payments on the nonrecourse notes payable is based on principal collections net of losses on the securitized auto loan receivables the current portion of nonrecourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period 

 

as of february 28 2014  637 billion of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations thes e notes payable accrue interest at fixed rates and have scheduled maturities through   august 2020  but may mature earlier or later depending on the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables during fiscal 2014 we completed four term securitizations funding a total of 386 billion of auto loan receivables 

our term securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in the pool of auto loan receivables falls below 10 of the original pool balance during fiscal 2014 we exercised this option on four term securitizations that had originally been issued in 2009 and 2010 including one securitization for which carmax had provided 1400 million of capital or 14 of the transaction in the form of subordinated bonds upon the exercise of this option we funded substantially all of the remaining receivables through our warehouse facilities 

as of   february 28 2014   879 0   million of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities the combined warehouse facility limit is 1 8 billion and the unused warehouse capacity totaled 9 21 0 m illion during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we increased the limit of our  900 million warehouse facility that was scheduled to expire in february 201 4 to  1   billion and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we renewed the facility for an additional 36 4 day term of the combined warehouse facility limit  800   million will expire in august 2014 and  1   b illion will expire in february 2015  the return requirements of the warehouse facility investors could fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions at renewal the cost structure and capacity of the facilities could change these changes could have a significant effect on our funding costs see notes 2f and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

the securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to securitize receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the securitized receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

we expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements saleleaseback transactions and borrowings under existing new or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund caf capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing  funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements 

in fiscal 2013 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 800 million of our common stock purchases may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions at management’s discretion and the timing and amount of repurchases are determined based on share price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares repurchased are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock 

during fiscal 2014 we repurchased 69 million shares of common stock for 3060 million or an average purchase price of 4461 per share as of february 28 2014 2821 million was available for repurchase under the authorization expiring on december 31 2014 amounts reported as the repurchase and retirement of common stock on our statement of cash flows may reflect timing differences in trade and settlement dates on stock repurchase transactions occurring at the end of a reporting period subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10 billion of carmax common stock through december 31 2015

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

auto loan receivables 

as of february 28 2014 and 2013 all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved through cash flow or asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and floatingrate securities our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies other r eceivables are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities 

composition of auto loan receivables 

  



  

  1 we have entered into derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments in anticipation of permanent funding for these receivables in the term securitization market the current notional amount of these derivatives was  8690 million as of february 28 2014  and  7500 million as of february 28 2013  see note 5 

 2  other receivables include receivables not funded through the warehouse facilities 

  

interest rate exposure 

we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility substantially all of these borrowing are floatingrate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates woul d have decreased our fiscal 2014 net earnings per share by less than 001 

borrowings under our warehouse facilit ies are also floating rate debt and are secured by auto loan receivables on which we collect interest at fixed rates the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until we elect to fund them through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement this floatingrate risk is mitigated by funding the receivables through a term securitization or other funding arrangement and by entering into derivative instruments  absent any additional actions by the company to further mitigate risk a 100basis point increase in market interest rates associated with the warehouse facilities would have decreased our fiscal 2014 net earnings per share by approximately 002

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background carmax inc was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax superstore in richmond virginia in 1997 circuit city completed the initial public offering of a tracking stock that was intended to track separately the performance of the carmax operations on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company 

carmax business we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through carmax superstores 

 

carmax sales operations  we are the natio n’s largest retailer of used cars based on the 447728 used vehicles we retailed during the fiscal year ended february 2 8  2 013  as of the end of fiscal 2013  we operated 118 used car superstores in 58 metropolitan markets in addition we are one of the nation’s largest wholesale vehicle auction operators based on the 324779 wholesale vehicles we sold through our onsite auctions in fiscal 2013  

we were the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality used vehicles at competitively low “nohaggle” prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility our consumer offer allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers we provide low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified vehicles and superior customer service our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems 

our consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options terms and associated prices of each component the customer can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer our nohaggle pricing and our commission structure which is generally based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard allow sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

all of the used vehicles we retail are thoroughly reconditioned to meet our high standards and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale in fiscal 2013 87 of the used vehicles we retailed were 0 to 6 years old 

vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices make s our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for independent used car dealers as of february 28 2013 we conducted weekly or biweekly auctions at 57 of our 118 used car superstores 

in addition w e sell new vehicles at four locations under franchise agreements with three new car manufacturers in fiscal 2013  new vehicles comprised only 2  of our total retail vehicle unit sales 

our finance program provides customers financing alternatives through caf our own finance operation and thirdparty financing providers this program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum we believe the company’s processes and systems   transparency of pricing vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit provide a unique and ideal environment in which to originate and procure high quality auto loans caf focuses solely on originating loans through carmax stores customizing its offers to meet the customer’s risk profile and ensuring credit availability to support carmax retail vehicle unit sales all of the finance offers by caf and our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3 ‑day payoff offer whereby a customer can refinance their loan within three business days at no charge 

we provide customers with a full range of other related products and services including the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers the sale of extended service plans “esp” guaranteed asset protection “gap” and accessories and vehicle repair service 

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make an offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory through our instore appraisal process we also acquire a large portion of our used vehicle inventory through wholesale auctions and to a lesser extent directly from other sources including wholesalers dealers and fleet owners 

our proprietary inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process using the information provided by this system and applying statistical modeling techniques we are able to optimize our inventory mix anticipate future inventory needs at each store evaluate sales consultant and buyer performance and refine our vehicle pricing strategy because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of the entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

 

carmax auto finance  caf provides financing to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at carmax because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers caf offers financing solely to customers purchasing vehicles at carmax and offers qualifying customers an array of competitive rates and terms allowing them to choose the one that best fits their needs we believe caf enables us to capture additional sales profits and cash flows while managing our reliance on thirdparty finance sources after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 39 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2013 as of february 28 2013 caf serviced approximately 459000 customer accounts in its 593 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

industry and competition carmax sales operations  the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive according to industry sources as of december 31 201 2  there were approximately 17 8 00 franchised automotive dealerships which sell both new and used vehicles in addition used vehicles were sold by approximately 37900 independent used vehicle dealers as well as millions of private individuals our primary retail competitors are the franchised auto dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles independent used car dealers predominantly sell older higher mileage cars than we do the number of franchised and independent auto dealers has gradually declined over the last decade in large part due to manufacturers’ franchise and brand terminations as well as dealership closures caused by the stress of the recession despite this reduction in the number of dealers the automotive retail environment remains highly fragmented 

based on industry data there were approximately 38 million used cars sold in the us in calendar year 201 2  of which approximately 13   million we re estimated to be latemodel 0 to 6 year   old vehicles and approximately 21 million were 0 to 10year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us selling more than two times as many used vehicles as the next largest retailer in calendar 201 2  we represented approximately   3  of the total latemodel used units sold over the last several years c ompetition has been affected by the increasing use of internetbased marketing for both used vehicles and vehicle financing   w e seek to distinguish ourselves from traditional dealerships through our consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies 

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our competitively low nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available both on site and via our website carmaxcom the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems caf and the locations of our retail stores in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides us a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our large volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provide s the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that don’t meet our retail standards upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfer fee s may apply depending on the distance the vehicle needs to travel  in fiscal 20 13  approximately 30 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request our carmax quality inspection assures that every vehicle we offer for sale meets our stringent standards we back every vehicle with a 5day m oneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty we maintain an ability to offer or arrange customer financing with competitive terms  and all financing is backed by our 3 ‑day payoff offer additionally we offer comprehensive and competitive ly priced   esp and gap products  we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas and that we enjoy advantages over competitors that employ traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques 

our sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid a commission generally based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the gross profit on the vehicle being sold in addition sales consultants do not receive commissions based on the number of credit approvals or the amount a customer finances this pay structure aligns our sales associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

in our wholesale auctions we compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast with the highly fragmented used vehicle market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors  manheim a subsidiary of cox enterprises and kar auction services inc representing an estimated 70 of the us whole car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax predominantly s ells older higher mileage vehicles we believe the principal competitive advantages of our wholesale auctions include our high vehicle sales rate our vehicle condition disclosures and arbitration policies our broad geographic distribution and 

 

our dealerfriendly practices because we own the cars that we auction we generally sell more tha n 95 o f the vehicles offered which is substantially higher than the sales rate at most other auto auctions our policy of making vehicle condition disclosures noting mechanical and other issues found during our appraisal process is also not a typical practice used at other auctions of older higher mileage vehicles together these factors make our auctions attractive to dealers resulting in a high dealertocar attendance ratio 

carmax auto finance  caf operates in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market this sector is primarily comprised of banks captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers credit unions and independent finance companies  this sector represented approximately 800 billion in outstanding receivables as of december 31 2012 according to industry data as of february 28 2013 caf had 593 billion in managed receivables having originated 345 billion in loans during the fiscal year for loans originated during the calendar quarter ended december 31 2012 caf ranked 20th in market share for all vehicle loans and 9th in market share for used vehicle loans 

caf’s competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary fi nance source in carmax stores we believe t he company’s processes and systems transparency of pricing vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment because caf offers financing solely through carmax stores scoring models are optimized for the carmax channel 

caf’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing cars from dealers some of our customers have already obtained financing prior to shopping for a vehicle and do not apply for financing in the store we also offer customers the ability to pay off their loans within three days without penalty the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our rates 

marketing and advertising our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmaxcom and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle our marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts carmaxcom internet search engines and online classified listings we also reach out to customers and potential customers to build awareness and loyalty through facebook twitter and other social media television and radio advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer broadcast and internet advertisements are designed to drive customers to our stores and to carmaxcom 

we strive to adjust our marketing programs in response to the evolving media landscape we have customized our marketing program based on awareness levels in each market we have transitioned a portion of our television and radio advertising to national cable network and national radio programming and we will continue to seek to optimize our media mix between local and national distribution in addition to providing cost savings this transition allows us to build awareness of carmax prior to our entrance into new markets we are also building awareness and driving traffic to our stores and carmaxcom by listing retail vehicles on online classified sites our advertising on the internet also includes advertisements on search engines such as google and yahoo as well as online properties such as pandora and hulu 

our website carmaxcom is a marketing tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online the website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on each of the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated several times per day carmaxcom includes detailed information such as vehicle photos prices features specifications and store locations as well as advanced featurebased search capabilities and sorting and comparison tools that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and email alerts when new inventory arrives virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory can be transferred at customer request to their local superstore customers can contact sales consultants in a variety of ways including online via carmaxcom customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home including applying for financing and they need to visit the store only to complete the final steps of the transaction such as   signing the paperwork and picking up their vehicle we also have a mobile website and mobile apps that allow customers to search for and view cars on their smartphones and other mobile devices our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2013 approximately 80 of customers who purchased a vehic le from us had first visited us online 

 

we also maintain a website carmaxauctionscom that supports our wholesale auctions this website which is accessible only by authorized dealers provides listings of all vehicles that will be available in upcoming auctions it also has many features similar to our retail website including vehicle photos free vehicle history reports and vehicle search and alert capabilities 

suppliers for used vehicles we acquire used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our appraisal process as well as through other sources including local regional and online auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the supply of used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the rate of new vehicle sales which in turn generate usedcar tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions 

according to industry data as of december 31 2012 there we re approximately 247 million light vehicles in operation in the us including approximately 78 million vehicles that were 0 to 6   years old prior to the recession generally 16 million to 17 million new vehicles and 40 million to 45 million used vehicles were sold annually in the us in addition approximately 9 million to 10 million used vehicles were remarketed annually in wholesale auctions during the recession retail vehicle sales dropped sharply with calendar year 2009 new car sales falling to 10 million and used car sales to 35 million new car sales have gradually improved since 2009 but they remain below prerecession levels the resulting decline in the total supply of 06 year old vehicles combined with a reduction in tradein activity and fewer offlease vehicles has resulted in a tighter supply of latemodel used vehicles in recent years while we have maintained steady access to inventory during this period the used car supply constraints have resulted in strong wholesale valuations which have increased our acquisition costs and average selling prices for used vehicles 

our used vehicle inventory acquired directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the consumer preferences in each market we have replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which a carmaxtrained buyer appraises a customer’s vehicle and provides the owner with a written guaranteed offer that is good for seven days   an appraisal is available to every customer free of charge whether or not the customer purchases a vehicle from us based on their age mileage or condition  fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this instore appraisal process meet our highquality retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions  

the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers who handle both onsite appraisals and offsite auction purchases our buyers evaluate all used vehicles based on internal and external auction data and market sales as well as estimated reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases transportation cost s  o ur buyers in collaboration with our home office staff utilize the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system to decide which inventory to purchase at offsite auctions our inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross profit per unit 

based on consumer acceptance of the instore appraisal process our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

suppliers for new vehicles our new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales service and dealer agreements among other things these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies 

seasonality historically our business has been seasonal typically our superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter when used vehicles generally experience proportionately more of their annual depreciation we believe this is partly the result of a decline in customer traffic as well as discounts on model year closeouts that can pressure pricing for latemodel used vehicles customer traffic generally tends to slow in the fall as the weather changes and as customers shift their spending priorities  we typically experience an increase in subprime traffic and sales in february and march coincident with tax refund season 

 

products and services 

merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices our used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as chrysler ford general motors honda hyundai kia mazda nissan toyota and volkswagen and luxury brands such as acura bmw infiniti lexus and mercedesbenz our primary focus is vehicles that are 0 to 6 years old and generally range in price from 12000 to 34000 for the more costconscious consumer we also offer used cars that are more than 6 years old the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences 

we have implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which we set nohaggle prices on both our used and new vehicles we believe that our pricing is competitive prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom and on applicable online classified sites on which they are listed we extend our nohaggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction including vehicle appraisal offers financing rates accessories and esp and gap pricing 

wholesale auctions vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions as of february 28 2013 wholesale auctions were conducted at 57 of our 118 superstores and were generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned which depends on the number of stores in that market and the consumer awareness of carmax and our instore appraisal offer the typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles participants in carmax auctions must be licensed automobile dealers and are required to register with our centralized auction support group the majority of the participants are independent automobile dealers  we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions the average auction sales rate was 97 in fiscal 2013 dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase 

  

extended service plans and guaranteed asset protection at the time of the sale we offer the customer an esp we sell these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors under the thirdparty service plan programs we have no contractual liability to the customer the esps we offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 72 months subject to mileage limitations and include multiple mileage and deductible options depending on the vehicle odometer reading make and model we offer esps at competitive fixed prices which are based primarily on the historical repair record of the vehicle make and model the mileage option selected and the deductible chosen all esps that we sell other than manufacturer programs have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements we receive a commission from the administrator at the time of sale  in fiscal 20 13  more than 60 of the customers who purchas ed a used vehicle also purchased an esp    

our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the quality of the services provided by this network as well as the broad scope of our esp s helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty  and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

we also offer gap at the time of the sale gap is a product that will pay the difference between the customer’s insurance settlement and the finance contract payoff amount on their vehicle in the case of a total loss or unrecovered theft we sell this product on behalf of an unrelated third party that is the primary obligor and we have no contractua l liability to the customer gap has been designed to our specifications and is administered by the third party through a privatelabel arrangement we receive a commission from the administrator at the time of sale i n fiscal 2013 more than 20 of customers who purchased a used vehicle also purchased gap 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the renewal process used to make sure every car meets our high standards before it can become a carmax quality certified cqc vehicle   this process includes a comprehensive carmax quality inspection of the engine and all major systems including cooling fuel drivetrain transmission electronics suspension brakes steering air conditioning and other equipment as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle based on this quality inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our quality standards we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services we engage third parties specializing in those services many superstores   depend upon nearby  typically larger superstores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead 

 

all carmax used car superstores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by our esps we also provide factoryauthorized service at all new car franchises we have developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that our retail repair service is conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as our other operations 

we believe that the efficiency of our reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by our modern facilities our information systems and our technician training and development process the training and development process and our compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of technicians identify opportunities for waste reduction and achieve highquality repairs our information systems allow us to track repair history and enable trend analysis which guides our continuous improvement efforts 

customer credit we offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through caf and our arrangements with several industryleading financial institutions   we believe our program enables us to capture additional sales and enhances the carmax consumer offer c redit application s are initially reviewed by caf  customers who are not approved by caf may be evaluated by the other financial institutions    having a n array of financ e sources increases discrete approvals  expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax  in fiscal 2013 90 of our applicants received an approval from one or more of our sources w e periodically test additional thirdparty providers  

retail c ustomers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through   our proprietary information system a majority of applicants receive a response within five minutes v ehicle s are financ ed   using   retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles c ustomers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges depending on the credit profile of the customer third party finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract the fee amount is independent of any finance term offered to the customer it does not vary based on the amount financed the term of the loan the interest rate or the loantovalue ratio we refer to the providers who pay us a fee as prime and nonprime providers and we refer to the providers to whom we pay a fee as subprime providers we have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers  

we do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions however we have made arrangements to have thirdparty financing available to our auction customers 

systems 

our stores are supported by an advanced proprietary information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions customers can search our entire vehicle inventory through our website carmaxcom and our mobile apps they can also print a detailed listing for any vehicle which includes the vehicle’s features and specifications and its location on the display lot we also have a mobile website and mobile apps that allow customers to search for and view cars on their smartphones and other mobile devices our integrated inventory management system tracks every vehicle through its life from purchase through reconditioning and testdrives to ultimate sale using radio frequency identification “rfid” tags and bar codes all vehicles are scanned and tracked daily as a loss prevention measure testdrive information is captured using rfid tags linking the specific vehicle and the sales consultant we also capture data on vehicles we wholesale which helps us track market pricing a computerized finance application process and computerassisted document preparation ensure rapid completion of the sales transaction behind the scenes our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity in addition our store system provides a direct link to our proprietary credit processing information system to facilitate the credit review and approval process of caf and third party providers 

our proprietary inventory management and pricing system is centralized and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each carmax location this system also generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on complex algorithms that take into account factors including sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which minimizes the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit 

 

our electronic repair order system “ero” is used to sequence reconditioning procedures ero provides information that helps increase quality and reduce costs which further enhances our customer service and profitability 

through our centralized systems we are able to quickly integrate new stores into our store network we continue to enhance and refine our information systems which we believe to be a core competitive advantage the design of our information systems incorporates offsite backups redundant processing and other measures to reduce the risk of significant data loss in the event of an emergency or disaster

competition automotive retailing is a highly competitive and highly fragmented business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers as well as millions of private individuals since we sell vehicles that do not meet our retail standards through onsite wholesale auctions our competition also includes automotive wholesalers competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices in addition competitors who have franchise relationships with automotive manufacturers brand certain used cars as “certified preowned” which could provide those competitors with an advantage over carmax new entrants to the automotive retail market or new automotive wholesalers could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected retail and wholesale sales and margins 

the increasing use of the internet to market  buy and sell used vehicles and to provide vehicle financing could have a material adverse effect   on our sales and results of operations the increasing online availability of used vehicle information including pricing information could make it more difficult for us to differentiate our customer offering from competitors’ offerings could result in lowerthanexpected retail margins and could have a material adverse effect on our   business sales and results of operations in addition our competitive standing is affected by companies including search engines such as google bing and yahoo and online classified sites such as autotradercom and carscom that are not direct competitors but that may direct online traffic to the websites of competing automotive retailers the increasing activities of these companies could make it more difficult for 

 

carmaxcom to attract traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

caf and our thirdparty financing providers are subject to competition from various financial institutions if we we re unable to continue providing competitive finance offers to our customers through caf and our thirdparty financing providers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations in addition we believe that caf allows us to capture additional sales profits and cas h flows accordingly if caf was unable to continue making competitive finance offers to our customers it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

capital changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support the origination of auto loan receivables through caf and our geographic expansion could adversely affect sales operating strategies and store growth further our current credit facility and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants andor performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants or performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf initially we sell these receivables into our warehouse facilit ies  we periodically refinance the receivables through term securitizations changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market   could lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or require us to seek alternative means to finance caf’s loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations  

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

thirdparty financing providers carmax provides financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty financing providers in the event that one or more of these thirdparty providers could no longer    or choose not to provide financing to our customers could only provide financing to a reduced segment of our customers or could no longer provide financing at competitive rates of interest it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

retail prices any significant changes in retail prices for new and used vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations if prices for used vehicles rise significantly due to supply constraints this could adversely affect consumer demand for vehicles   if retail prices for used vehicles rise relative to retail prices for new vehicles it could make buying a new vehicle more attractive to our customers than buying a used vehicl e which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

inventory a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect   on our business a failure to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or a failure to recognize those trends could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory should we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate the excess inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect   on our results of operations 

regulatory and legislative environment we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as licensing requirements and laws regarding advertising vehicle sales financing and employment practices our facilities and business operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety the violation of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against business operations as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations further private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities continue to scrutinize advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced 

 

recent federal legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms may result in an increase in expenses or a decrease in revenues   for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” regulates among other things the provision of consumer financing   the doddfrank act established a new consumer financial protection agency the consumer financial protection bureau “cfpb” with broad regulatory powers   the cfpb is responsible for administering and enforcing laws and regulations related to consumer financial products and services the evolving regulatory environment in the wake of the doddfrank act and the creation of the cfpb may increase the cost of regulatory compliance or result in changes to business practices that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as it is phased in over time significantly affects the provision of health care services and may impact the cost of providing our associates with health coverage   current federal labor policy could lead to increased unionization efforts which could increase labor costs disrupt store operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

reputation our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering a broad selection of carmax quality certified vehicles at competitive nohaggle prices with a customerfriendly sales process in attractive modern facilities is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which this reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results accordingly if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or traditional media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

confidential c ustomer and associate i nformation in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer and associate information and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers despite the security measures we have in place and the assurances we have from our thirdparty providers our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty service providers could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer or associate information whether experienced by us or by our thirdparty service providers and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident a programming error or other cause could damage our reputation expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement disrupt our business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on   our sales and results of operations 

growth the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could have a material adverse effect   on our business sales and results of operations in addition our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

management and workforce our success depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business our ability to meet our staffing needs while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changes in employment legislation competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and associate relations an inability to retain qualified associates or a significant increase in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

information systems our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales inventory carmaxcom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect   on our sales and results of operations in addition despite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems we could be subjected to attacks by hackers including denialofservice attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations 

litigation we are subject to various litigation matters from time to time which could have a material adverse effect   on our business and results of operations claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or 

 

criminal investigations and proceedings these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

automotive manufacturers adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could   have a material adverse effect   on our results of operations  manufacturer recalls could also adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations and   could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of a recalled vehicle which could have a material adverse effect   on our business sales and results of operations  

weather the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes or other natural disasters could cause store closures adversely affecting consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect   on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

seasonal fluctuations our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

geographic concentration our   performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us including florida and in texas southern california and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experienced a downturn in economic conditions it could have a material adverse effect   on our business sales and results of operations 

accounting policies and matters we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain     these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 materially different amounts could be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions in addition t he implementation of new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

other material events the occurrence of acts of terrorism the outbreak of war or other significant national or international events could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations or financial condition

 item 2 properties 

we conduct our retail vehicle operations in two basic formats – production and nonproduction superstores production superstores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed production superstores have more service bays and require additional space for workinprocess inventory and   therefore are generally larger than nonproduction stores in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction superstore on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some superstores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction superstores until we expand our presence in that market as of february   2 8    20 13  we op erated 68 production superstores and 50 nonproduction superstores 

as of february 28 2013 we operated 57 wholesale auctions most of which were located at production superstores stores at which auctions are conducted generally have additional space to store wholesale inventory as of february 28 2013 we also operated one new car store which was located adjacent to our used car superstore in laurel maryland our remaining three new car franchises are operated as part of our used car superstores 

production superstores are generally 40000 to 60000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres but a few range from 70000 to 95000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres nonproduction superstores are generally 10000 to 25000 square feet on 4 to 12 acres

as of february 28  20 13  we leased 5 8 of our 1 1 8   used car super stores  our new car store and our caf office building in atlanta georgia we owned the remaining 60 stores currently in operation we also own ed our home office building in richmond v irginia and land associated with planned future store openings   

expansion 

since opening our first used car superstore in 1993 we have grown organically through the construction and opening of companyoperated stores we do not franchise our operations as of february 28 2013 we operated 118 used car superstores in 58 us markets which represented approximately 53  of the us population we believe that further geographic expansion and additional fillin opportunities in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth 

in december 2008 we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment we resumed store growth in fiscal 2011 opening 3 superstores that year 5 superstores in fiscal 2012 and 10 superstores in fiscal 2013 we currently plan to open 13 superstores in fiscal 2014 and between 10 and 15 in each of the following 2 fiscal years

business overview 

general 

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we operate in two reportable segments carmax sales operations and carmax auto finance “caf” our carmax sales operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations excluding financing provided by caf our caf segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides vehicle financing through carmax superstores 

we pioneered the used car superstore concept opening our first store in 1993 our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems as of february 28 2013 we operated 118 used car superstores in 58 markets comprising 45 midsized markets 1 2 large markets and 1 small market we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000 and 25 million people we also operated four new car franchises during fiscal 2013 we sold 447728 used cars representing 98  of the total 455583 v ehicles we sold at retail 

we believe the carmax consumer offer is distinctive within the auto retailing marketplace our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other big box retailers our consumer offer features low nohaggle prices a broad selection of carmax quality certified used vehicles and superior customer service our website carmaxcom is a valuable tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer as well as a sophisticated search engine and efficient channel for customers who prefer to commence their shopping online our financial results are driven by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing extended service plans “esps” a guaranteed asset protection “gap” product and vehicle repair service  gap is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft 

our financial results also reflect the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards these vehicles are sold through onsite wholesale auctions wholesale auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis and as of february 28 2013 we conducted auctions at 57 used car superstores during fiscal 2013 we sold 324779 wholesale vehicles on average the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers 

we sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors as of february 28 2013 the used vehicle thirdparty esp providers were cna national warranty corporation and the warranty group and the thirdparty gap provider was safeguard products international llc we have no contractual liability to the customer under these thirdparty plans esp revenue represents commissions earned on the sale of esps and gap from the unrelated third parties 

we provide financing to qualified retail customers through caf our finance operation and our arrangements with several industryleading financial institutions as of february 28 2013 these third parties included capital one auto finance santander consumer usa wells fargo dealer services and american credit acceptance  depending on the credit profile of the customer the thirdparty finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract the fee amount is independent of any finance term offered to the customer it does not vary based on the amount financed the term of the loan the interest rate or the loantovalue ratio we refer to the providers who pay us a fee as prime and nonprime providers and we refer to the providers to whom we pay a fee as subprime providers w e periodically test additional thirdparty providers  we have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers  

 

we offer financing through caf to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at carmax caf utilizes proprietary customized scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment caf offers customers an array of competitive rates and terms allowing them to choose the ones that best fit their needs in addition customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract with caf or a thirdparty provider within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges we randomly test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and 3day payoffs to assess market competitiveness after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 39 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2013 as of february 28 2013 caf serviced approximately 459000 customer accounts in its 593 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

over the long term we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base increased vehicle unit sales should also drive increased sales of wholesale vehicles and ancillary products and caf income we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price  

in december 2008 we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment we opened 3 superstores in fiscal 2011 5 superstores in fiscal 2012 and 10 superstores in fiscal 2013 we currently plan to open 13 superstores in fiscal 2014 and between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following 2 fiscal years  while we currently have more than 100 superstores we are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 2 8  201 3  we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 53  of the us population 

th e principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to build our management bench strength to support our store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at favorable terms  we staff each newly opened store with associates who have extensive carmax training  therefore w e must recruit train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings 

fiscal 2013 highlights 

















  

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving securitization program composed of two warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf until they are funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into the warehouse facilities and term securitizations as secured borrowings which result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expenses  

auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers related to retail vehicle sales financed through caf the receivables are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance 

se e notes 2f 2i and 4 for additional inf ormation on securitizations and auto loan receivables 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5 ‑day moneyback guarantee we record a reserve for estimated returns based on historical experience and trends  and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle the esps we offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 72 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract because we are not the primary obligor under these plans we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale net of a reserve for estimated customer cancellations  the reserve for cancellations is based on historical experience and trends  and results could be affected if future cancellations differ from historical averages 

customers applying for financing who are not approved by caf may be evaluated by other financial institutions depending on the credit profile of the customer thirdparty finance providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we recognize these fees at the time of sale 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted  see note 8 for additional information on income taxes 

 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider available carrybacks future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 28 2013 will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 the 12 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2013 resulted from a 10 increase in used unit sales and a 2 increase in average retail selling price the increase in used unit sales included a 5 increase in comparable store used unit sales together with sales from newer stores not yet included in the comparable store base the comparable store unit growth was driven by improved conversion which we believe benefited from a variety of factors including more compelling credit offers from thirdparty finance providers and caf increased inventory selection and continued strong instore execution 

the increase in average retail selling price primarily reflected changes in our sales mix by vehicle age with an increased mix of ages 02 vehicles and a reduced mix of ages 34 vehicles which corresponds to the model years in shortest supply the overall supply of latemodel used vehicles being remarketed has remained constrained following four years of new car industry sales at rates significantly below prerecession levels during much of the period from 2009 through 2011 wholesale vehicle industry values rose which increased our vehicle acquisition costs and average selling prices compared with prerecession periods we believe the constrained supply of latemodel used vehicles and the resulting increase in selling prices has had an adverse effect on our used vehicle sales in recent years as new car industry sales return to historical levels the supply of latemodel used vehicles should gradually improve which we believe will benefit our business 

our data indicated that we increased our share of the latemodel 0 to 6year old used vehicle market by approximately 4  in fiscal 2013 this data also indicated that our share of the broader 0 to 10year old used vehicle market grew approximately 7  reflecting shifts in our inventory mix in recent years in response to changing consumer preferences we believe our ability to grow market share year after year is a reflection of the strength of our consumer offer the skill of our associates and the preference for our brand  

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 the 9 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2012 resulted from a 5 increase in average retail selling price and a 3 increase in unit sales the growth in the average retail selling price primarily reflected increases in our acquisition costs which resulted from the yearoveryear increase in used vehicle wholesale industry values a shift in our sales mix moderated the effect of higher acquisition costs on our average retail selling price during fiscal 2012 5 to 10year old vehicles which generally have lower selling prices than latermodel vehicles represented an increased portion of our sales mix 

the 3 increase in used unit sales included a 1 increase in comparable store used unit sales together with sales from superstores not yet included in the comparable store base we believe the modest rate of comparable store used unit sales growth reflected both a challenging sales comparison with fiscal 2011 when comparable store used unit sales increased 10 and the continuation of weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence for much of fiscal 2012  while customer traffic at comparable stores was higher than in the prior year a larger portion of the fiscal 2012 traffic represented customers who only obtained vehicle appraisals which contributed to a decline in sales conversion 

 

our data indicated that we increased our share of the late model   used vehicle market by approximately 3 in fiscal 2012 we achieved market share growth despite a shift within the market for 0 ‑ to 6 ‑year old vehicles towards older used vehicles and having fewer immature stores those less than five years old in our store base due to our temporary suspension of store growth historically market share gains are strongest among immature stores

we seek to build customer satisfaction by offering highquality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles sold 

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 the 2 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2013 resulted from a 3 increase in wholesale unit sales offset by a slight reduction in average wholesale vehicle selling price the wholesale unit growth included the combined effects of the growth in our store base and higher appraisal traffic offset by a lower appraisal buy rate the modest growth in wholesale unit sales also reflected the challenging comparisons with fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 when wholesale unit sales grew 20 and 33 respectively 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 the 32 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2012 resulted from a 20 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 10 increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price the increase in unit sales primarily reflected a significant increase in appraisal traffic while the appraisal buy rate remained high relative to historical averages it declined modestly from the prior year our appraisal traffic benefited from the increase in customer traffic in our stores and from the lift in new car industry sales and related used vehicle tradein activity in fiscal 2012 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of esps and gap   reported in esp revenues service department sales and   net thirdparty finance fees the fixed pervehicle fees paid to us by prime and nonprime thirdparty finance providers may vary  reflecting the providers’ differing levels of credit risk exposure the fixed pervehicle fees that we pay to the subprime providers are reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from prime and nonprime providers  

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 other sales and revenues declined 2 in fiscal 2013 as an increase in esp revenues was more than offset by a decrease in net thirdparty finance fees esp revenues increased 13 primarily reflecting the growth in our retail vehicle unit sales and an increase in esp penetration the decrease in net thirdparty finance fees was driven by a mix shift among providers including an increase in the percentage of our retail unit sales financed by the subprime providers to 15 in fiscal 2013 versus 10 in fiscal 2012 the growth in the subprime sales mix primarily resulted from more compelling credit offers being made by the subprime providers 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 other sales and revenues declined 4 in fiscal 2012 as a 3 increase in esp revenues was more than offset by a decrease in net thirdparty finance fees resulting from a mix change among providers subprime providers financed 10 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2012 compared with 8 in fiscal 2011 the reduction in net thirdparty finance fees also reflected the decision by caf to retain an increased portion of the loans that thirdparty providers had been purchasing following caf’s tightening of lending standards beginning in fiscal 2010 as caf retained an increased portion of these loans the fees previously received from   third parties declined 

  

gross profit 

  



  

 

gross profit per unit 

  



  

  1   calculated as category gross profit divided by its respective units sold except the other and total categories which are divided by total retail units sold 

2   calculated as a percentage of its respective sales or revenue 

  

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit 

we employ a volumebased strategy and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction over the past several years we have successfully managed to generate a used vehicle gross profit per unit within a fairly narrow range 

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 used vehicle gross profit increased 9 in fiscal 2013 driven primarily by the 10 increase in used unit sales used vehicles gross profit per unit was only marginally lower averaging 2170 in fiscal 2013 versus 2177 in fiscal 2012 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 used vehicle gross profit increased 4 in fiscal 2011 reflecting the combination of the 3 increase in used unit sales and a 1 improvement in gross profit per unit used vehicle gross profit per unit increased 21 to 2177 per unit compared with 2156 per unit in fiscal 2011 our shift to selling an increased mix of 5 to 10year old vehicles in fiscal 2012 increased our average reconditioning cost per unit as older vehicles typically require more reconditioning effort however the older vehicles we sold were generally no les s profitable than newer models 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

the strength of our wholesale gross profit per unit in recent years reflects the strong demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions   the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles 

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 2 in fiscal 2013 driven by the 3 increase in wholesale unit sales wholesale gross profit per unit was relatively stable declining only 4 per unit 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 26 in fiscal 2012 the improvement reflected the 20 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 5 rise in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit to 953 per unit from 908 per unit in fiscal 2011 the yearoveryear increase in industry pricing and strong dealer demand contributed to the improved wholesale gross profit per unit 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to esp and gap revenues net thirdparty finance fees and the service department we have no cost of sales related to esp and gap revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent commissions paid to us by certain thirdparty providers net of the fees we pay to thirdparty subprime 

 

finance providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition and amount of other gross profit 

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 other gross profit declined 1 in fiscal 201 3  as improved esp and service department profits were more than offset by the lower net third party finance fees 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 other gross profit fell 10 in fiscal 201 2  as the 3 growth in esp profits was more than offset by the lower net thirdparty finance fees and service department profits service department gross profit declined 122 million primarily due to the deleverage associated with increased service overhead costs the modest retail unit sales growth and lower service retail sales 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not been a significant contributor to results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices however increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit caf income to the extent the average amount financed also increases 

during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011  we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing we believe the appreciation resulted in part from the reduced supply of latemodel used vehicles in the market that was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle tradein activity compared with prerecession periods the higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our average selling prices for us ed and wholesale vehicles in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we also   experienced inflationary increases in key reconditioning costs 

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

components of sga expense 

  



  

  1   excludes compensation and benefits related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service which is included in cost of sales 

2   includes it expenses insurance bad debt travel preopening and relocation costs charitable contributions and other administrative expenses 

  

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 sga expenses increased 10 in fiscal 2013 the increase primarily reflected the combination of the 9 expansion in our store base during fiscal 2013 representing the addition of 10 stores higher variable selling costs resulting from the 5 increase in comparable store used unit sales and higher growthrelated costs growthrelated costs include store preopening expenses relocation expenses and the costs of maintaining store management bench strength to support future growth these costs were affected by the increase in the rate of our store openings from 5 stores in fiscal 2012 to 10 stores in fiscal 2013 sga per retail unit was consistent at 2263 in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 sga expenses increased 7 in fiscal 2012 the increase was driven by the 5 expansion of our store base in fiscal 2012 representing the addition of five stores higher growthrelated costs and increases in variable selling cost s  sga per retail unit rose 4 to 2263 from 2173 in fiscal 2011 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 381 in fiscal 2013 380 in fiscal 2012 and 379 in fiscal 2011 

  

  

 

results of operations – carmax auto finance 

caf provides financing to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at carmax because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers while financing can also be obtained from thirdparty sources we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk  furthermore we believe the company’s processes and systems   transparency of pricing vehicle quality and the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans bot h for caf and for the thirdparty finance providers 

we believe caf enables us to capture additional sales profits and cash flows while managing our reliance on third   party finance sources management regularly analyzes cafs operating results by assessing profitability the performance of the auto loan receivables including trends in credit losses and delinquencies and caf direct expenses 

caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables a provision for estimated loan losses and direct caf expense s caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs we present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefits or costs that could be attributed to caf examples of indirect costs not allocated to caf include retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources administrative services marketing information systems accounting legal treasury and executive payroll

2   vehicle units financed as a percentage of total retail units sold 

  

fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 caf income increased 14 to 2993 million compared with 2622 million in fiscal 2012 primarily reflecting the growth in managed receivables despite the growth in our receivables direct expenses decreased modestly as we benefited from operating efficiencies 

caf’s average managed receivables increased 16 during fiscal 2013 driven by the growth in caf origination volume throughout fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 origination volumes benefited from an increase in caf’s loan penetration as we have transitioned back to our prerecession origination strategy and reduced the volume of finance contracts we were selling to thirdparty providers our decision to retain the loans that third parties had been purchasing primarily reflected our confidence in our ability to economically fund these loans this transition was completed in january 2012 originations also benefited from increased ave rage retail selling prices which translated into an increase in the average amount financed and from the growth in retail unit sales during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 additionally historically low funding costs have allowed caf to begin offering more compelling credit offers positive customer response to these credit offers further bolstered caf origination volumes in the second half of fiscal 2013 see note 4 for additional information on the credit quality of auto loan receivables 

total interest margin which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs was 74 of average managed receivables for fiscal 2013 similar to the 73 margin in fiscal 2012 for the past several years caf has benefited from historically low funding costs in the assetbacked securitization market rising interest rates or competitive pressure on consumer rates could result in compression in the interest margin on new originations we began to experience this compression in the second half of fiscal 2013 as we lowered rates in response to customer demand which resulted in lower interest margins on new originations changes in the interest margin on new originations affect caf income over time as loans amortize within the portfolio of managed receivables 

the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance for fiscal 2013 the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average managed receivables increased moderately to 10 compared to 08 in fiscal 2012 low unit chargeoffs and strong recovery rates continued to partially offset the effect of the change in credit mix resulting from the transition in our origination strategy 

allowance for loan losses 

  



  

  1   percent of total ending managed receivables as of the corresponding reporting date 

  

the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the economic environment 

 

the allowance for loan losses increased to 10 of managed receivables or 573 million as of february 28 2013 compared with 09 or 433 million as of february 29 2012 the increase in the allowance reflected the growth in managed receivables and the origination and retention of loans with greater credit risk resulting from the transition in our origination strategy partially offset by the net effects of low unit chargeoffs and strong recovery rates relative to historical norms we expect the allowance for loan losses as a percent of managed receivables to increase in future periods as the higher credit risk loans continue to become a larger percentage of managed receivables 

past due account information 

  



  

credit loss information 

  



  

as of february 28 2013 past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables increased modestly compared with february 29 2012 while net credit losses increased to 078 of average managed receivables from 069 the increase in net credit losses reflected the growth in average managed receivables and the origination and retention of loans with greater credit risk resulting from the transition in our origination strategy low unit chargeoffs and strong recovery rates continued to partially offset the effect of this change in credit mix 

the average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated generally at our wholesale auctions the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42 to a high of 60 and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 caf income increased 19 to 2622 million compared with 2200 million in fiscal 2011 reflecting the combined effects of the growth in managed receivables an increase in total interest margin and favorable caf loan loss experience 

caf’s average managed receivables increased 10 during fiscal 2012 net loans originated increased 32 to 284 billion from 215 billion in fiscal 2011 reflecting our decision to retain an increased portion of the loans that thirdparty providers had been purchasing since caf’s tightening of lending standards in fiscal 2010 as well as our growth in retail vehicle revenues 

the total interest margin increased to 73 of average managed receivables versus 67 in fiscal 2011 as a percentage of managed receivables interest and fee income declined modestly to 96 from 99 in fiscal 2011  primarily reflecting the effect of the amortization of older loans partly offset by the shift in the credit quality mix in more recent loan originations over the last few years the average contract rate charged on auto loans has gradually declined and older loans with higher contract rates have become a smaller portion of total managed receivables the weighted average contract rate on current loan originations increased slightly to 88 in fiscal 2012 from 87 in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting our increased retention of higher risk loans during fiscal 2012 loans with higher risk are generally charged higher rates of interest 

as a percentage of managed receivables interest expense declined to 23 from 32 in fiscal 2011  reflecting the effects of the amortization of older highercost term securitizations and the increased portion of managed receivables funded with newer lowercost securitizations 

 

the provision for loan losses increased modestly to 08 of average managed receivables or 364 million in fiscal   2012 from 07 or 277 million in fiscal 2011 the increase in the provision primarily reflected the cumulative effect of the origination and retention of loans with higher risk partly offset by favorable loss experience in fiscal 2012 

  

fiscal 201 4 planned superstore openings 

  



  

  1   opened in march 2013 

2   opened in april 2013 

  

normal permitting or other scheduling delays could shift the opening dates of any of these stores into a later period we estimate capital expenditures will total approximately  300 million in fiscal   201 4  we currently plan to open between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following 2 fiscal years

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund our existing operations new store expansion including capital expenditures and inventory purchas es and caf our finance operation  our p rimary ongoing sources of liquidity include existing cash balances funds provided by operations proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

operating activities  net cash used in operating activities totaled 7784 million in fiscal 2013 622 million in fiscal 2012 and 68 million in fiscal 2011 these amounts included increases in auto loan receivables of 9922 million 6757 million and 3047 million respectively the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are reflected as cash provided by financing activities 

inventory totaled 152 billion as of the end of fiscal 2013 up 39 versus 109 billion as of the end of fiscal 2012 the increase reflected a 40 increase in used vehicle inventories which was primarily attributable to a 35 increase in used vehicles in inventory the additional used vehicle units supported the ten stores opened during fiscal 2013 and our comparable store sales growth in addition during the second half of fiscal 2013 we built inventories at a higher rate than in recent years to better position ourselves for seasonal sales opportunities 

inventory totaled 109 billion as of the end of fiscal 2012 up 4 versus 105 billion as of the end of fiscal   2011 during fiscal 2012 used vehicle inventories increased 7 including a 6 increase in used vehicles that largely supported the opening of five new used car superstores the increase in used inventories was partially offset by a reduction in new vehicle inventory 

 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled 2553 million in fiscal 2013 2194 million in fiscal 2012 and 722 million in fiscal 2011 investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled 2357 million in fiscal 2013 1726 million in fiscal 2012 and 766 million in fiscal 2011 capital expenditures primarily include real estate acquisitions for planned future store openings and store construction costs we maintain a multiyear pipeline of store sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores that we plan to open in subsequent fiscal years the increases in capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 primarily related to the growth in our store opening pace as we increased store openings from 5 in fiscal 2012 to 10 in fiscal 2013 

historically capital expenditures have been funded with internallygenerated funds debt and saleleaseback transactions no saleleasebacks have been executed since fiscal 2009 

as of february 28 2013 we owned 60 and leased 58 of our 118 used car superstores 

restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables increased 200 million in fiscal 2013 and 433 million in fiscal 2012 versus a decrease of 16 million in fiscal 2011 these collections vary depending on the timing of the receipt of principal and interest payments on securitized auto loan receivables the change in average managed receivables and the funding vehicle utilized 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled 104 billion in fiscal 2013 6831 million in fiscal 2012 and 1018 million in fiscal 2011 included in these amounts were net increases in total nonrecourse notes payable of 117 billion 6704 million and 1873 million respectively which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of 9922 million 6757 million and 3047 million respectively in auto loan receivables in fiscal 2013 net cash provided by financing activities was net of 2034 million of stock repurchases in fiscal 2011 net cash provided by financing activities was net of a 1215 million net reduction in borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

total debt and cash and cash equivalents 

  



  

we have a 700 million unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in august 201 6 borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us see note 10 for additional information on the revolving credit facility 

the credit facility agreement contains representations and warranties conditions and covenants if these requirements were not met all amounts outstanding or otherwise owed could become due and payable immediately and other limitations could be placed on our ability to use any available borrowing capacity 

caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles  even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables  we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles  

the timing of principal payments on the nonrecourse notes payable is based on principal collections net of losses on the securitized auto loan receivables the current portion of nonrecourse notes payable represents principal payments that are due to be distributed in the following period 

as of february 28 2013  506 billion of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to term securitizations thes e notes payable accrue interest at fixed rates and have scheduled maturities through august 2019 but may 

 

mature earlier or later depending upon the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables during fiscal 2013 we completed three term securitizations funding a total of 299 billion of auto loan receivables 

our term securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in the pool of auto loan receivables falls below 10 of the original pool balance during fiscal 2013 we exercised this option on three term securitizations that had originally been issued in 2008 and for which carmax had provided 1150 million of capital upon the exercise of these options we funded substantially all of the remaining receivables throu gh our warehouse facilities  

as of   february 28 2013   7920   million of nonrecourse notes payable was outstanding related to our warehouse facilities the combined warehouse facility limit is 17 billion and the unused warehouse capacity totaled 9080 m illion during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we renewed our 800 million warehouse facility that was scheduled to expire in february 2013 for an additional 364day term and increased the limit to 900 million of the combined warehouse facility limit  800   million will expire in august 2013 and  9 00   million will expire in february 201 4  the return requirements of the warehouse facility investors could fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions at renewal the cost structure and capacity of the facilities could change these changes could have a significant effect on our funding costs see notes 2f and 10 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

the securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various representations and warranties covenants and performance triggers if these requirements are not met we could be unable to continue to securitize the receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition warehouse facility investors could charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the securitized receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox agreements to the warehouse facility agents 

we expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements saleleaseback transactions and borrowings under existing new or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund caf capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing  funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements 

in october 2012 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 300 million of our common stock with an expiration of december 31 2013 in january 2013 our board of directors authorized an additional 500 million for the repurchase of our common stock  expiring december 31 2014 purchase s may be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions at management’s discretion and the timing and amount of repurchases are determined based on share price market conditions legal requirements and other factors shares redeemed are deemed authorized but unissued shares of common stock 

during fiscal 2013 we repurchased 58 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of 3677 per share leaving 5881 million available for repurchase under the authorization of the 2119 million of purchases made during fiscal 2013 86 million related to trades that were not settled until march 2013 this amount was included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of february 28 2013

  1   this table excludes the nonrecourse notes payable that relate to auto loan receivables funded through term securitizations and our warehouse facilities the securitized receivables can only be used as collateral to settle obligations of these securitization vehicles in addition the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables see note 2f 

2   due to the uncertainty of forecasting expected variable interest rate payments those amounts are not included in the table see note 10

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

auto loan receivables 

as of february 28 2013 and february 29 2012 all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved through asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and floatingrate securities our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies other r eceivables are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 5 and 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities 

composition of auto loan receivables 

  



  

  1   we have entered into derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments in anticipation of permanent funding for these receivables in the term securitization market the current notional amount of these derivatives was 7500 million as of february 28 2013 and 6030 million as of february 29 2012 see note 5 

2   represents variablerate securities issued in connection with certain term securitizations that were synthetically altered to fixed at the bankruptcyremote special purpose entity 

3   other receivables include receivables not funded through the warehouse facilities 

  

interest rate exposure 

we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility substantially all of these borrowing are floatingrate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2013 net earnings per share by less than 001 

borrowings under our warehouse facilit ies are also floating rate debt and are secured by auto loan receivables on which we collect interest at fixed rates the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until they can be funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement this floatingrate risk is mitigated by funding the receivables through a term securitization or other funding arrangement and by entering into derivative instruments

 item 1 business tableend business overview 

carmax background carmax inc was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax superstore in richmond virginia in 1997 circuit city completed the initial public offering of a tracking stock that was intended to track separately the performance of the carmax operations on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company 

carmax business we are the nation’s largest retailer of used cars based on the 408080 used vehicles we retailed during the fiscal year ended february 29 2012 as of the end of fiscal 2012 we operated 108 used car superstores in 53 metropolitan markets in addition we are one of the nation’s largest wholesale vehicle auction operators based on the 316649 wholesale vehicles we sold through our onsite auctions in fiscal 2012 

we were the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality used vehicles at competitively low “nohaggle” prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility the carmax consumer offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other 

  

“bigbox” retailers and it is structured around four customer benefits low nohaggle prices a broad selection high quality vehicles and a customerfriendly sales process our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems 

the carmax consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options terms and associated prices of each component the customer can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer our nohaggle pricing and our commission structure which is generally based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard allow sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

all of the used vehicles we retail are thoroughly reconditioned to meet our high standards and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale in fiscal 2012 90 of the used vehicles we retailed were 0 to 6 years old 

we also wholesale used vehicles vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions unlike many other auto auctions we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate this high sales rate combined with dealerfriendly practices makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for independent used car dealers as of february 29 2012 we conducted weekly or biweekly auctions at 52 of our 108 used car superstores 

in addition we sell new vehicles at four locations under franchise agreements with three new car manufacturers in fiscal 2012 new vehicles comprised only 2 of our total retail vehicle unit sales 

our finance program provides customers financing alternatives through carmax auto finance “caf” our own finance operation and thirdparty financing providers this program provides access to credit for customers throughout the credit spectrum we believe that our processes and systems the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to originate and procure high quality auto loans caf focuses solely on originating loans through carmax stores customizing its offers to meet the customer’s risk profile and ensuring credit availability to support carmax retail vehicle unit sales 

we provide customers with a full range of other related products and services including the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers the sale of extended service plans “esp” guaranteed asset protection “gap” and accessories and vehicle repair service 

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make an offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us we acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory through this unique instore appraisal process we also acquire a large portion of our used vehicle inventory through wholesale auctions and to a lesser extent directly from other sources including wholesalers dealers and fleet owners 

our proprietary inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process using the information provided by this system and applying statistical modeling techniques we are able to optimize our inventory mix anticipate future inventory needs at each store evaluate sales consultant and buyer performance and refine our vehicle pricing strategy because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of the entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

industry and competition the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive according to industry sources as of december 31 2011 there were approximately 17900 franchised automotive dealerships which sell both new and used vehicles in addition used vehicles were sold by approximately 37500 independent used vehicle dealers as well as millions of private individuals our primary retail competitors are the franchised auto dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles independent used car dealers predominantly sell older higher mileage cars than we do the number of franchised and independent auto dealers has gradually declined over the last decade due to a variety of factors including franchise terminations resulting from the bankruptcy reorganizations of general motors and chrysler and the discontinuation of several brands by the major auto manufacturers despite the recent acceleration in dealership closures the automotive retail environment remains highly fragmented 

  

based on industry data there were approximately 39 million used cars sold in the us in calendar year 2011 of which between 15 million and 16 million were estimated to be latemodel 0 to 6year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us selling more than two times as many used vehicles as the next largest retailer in calendar 2011 we still represented less than 3 of the total latemodel used units sold over the last several years competition has been affected by the increasing use of internetbased marketing for both used vehicles and vehicle financing in both the used and new vehicle markets we seek to distinguish ourselves from traditional dealerships through our consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies 

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience by virtue of our competitively low nohaggle prices and our customerfriendly sales process our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available both on site and via our website carmaxcom the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems caf and the locations of our retail stores in addition we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle whether or not the customer is buying a car from us provides us a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles our large volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that don’t meet our retail standards upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfer fees may apply depending on the distance the vehicle needs to travel in fiscal 2012 approximately 30 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request our certified quality inspection assures that every vehicle we offer for sale meets our stringent standards we back every vehicle with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty we maintain an ability to offer or arrange customer financing with competitive terms all of the finance offers by caf and our thirdparty providers are backed by a 3day payoff offer whereby a customer can refinance their loan within three business days at no charge additionally we offer comprehensive and competitively priced esp and gap products we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas and that we enjoy advantages over competitors that employ traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques 

our sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid a commission generally based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the gross profit on the vehicle being sold in addition sales consultants do not receive commissions based on the number of credit approvals or the amount a customer finances this pay structure aligns our sales associates’ interests with those of our customers in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits 

in our wholesale auctions we compete with other automotive auction houses in contrast with the highly fragmented used vehicle market the automotive auction market has two primary competitors representing an estimated twothirds of the us whole car auction market these competitors auction vehicles of all ages while carmax predominately sells older higher mileage vehicles we believe our principal competitive advantages include our high vehicle sales rate our vehicle condition disclosures and arbitration policies our broad geographic distribution and our dealerfriendly practices because we own the cars that we auction we generally sell more than 95 of the vehicles offered which is substantially higher than the sales rate at most other auto auctions our policy of making vehicle condition disclosures noting mechanical and other issues found during our appraisal process is also not a typical practice used at other auctions of older higher mileage vehicles together these factors make our auctions attractive to dealers resulting in a high dealertocar attendance ratio 

marketing and advertising our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle our marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts carmaxcom internet search engines and online classified listings we also reach out to customers and potential customers to build awareness and loyalty through facebook twitter and other social media television and radio advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer broadcast and internet advertisements are designed to drive customers to our stores and to carmaxcom 

we continually adjust our marketing programs in response to the evolving media landscape we have customized our marketing program based on awareness levels in each market beginning in fiscal 2012 we began to transition a portion of our television and radio advertising to national cable network and national radio programming in 

  

addition to providing cost savings this transition allows us to build awareness of carmax prior to our entrance into new markets we are also building awareness and driving traffic to our stores and carmaxcom by listing retail vehicles on online classified sites such as autotradercom and carscom we believe using these online classified services allows our vehicles to appear on sites that are visited by a majority of buyers of latemodel used vehicles who use the internet in their shopping process our advertising on the internet also includes advertisements on search engines such as google and yahoo 

our website carmaxcom is a marketing tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online the website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on each of the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated several times per day carmaxcom includes detailed information such as vehicle photos prices features specifications and store locations as well as advanced featurebased search capabilities and sorting and comparison tools that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and email alerts when new inventory arrives virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory can be transferred at customer request to their local superstore customers can contact sales consultants online via carmaxcom by telephone or by fax customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home including applying for financing and they need to visit the store only to complete the final steps of the transaction such as signing the paperwork and picking up their vehicle we also have a mobile website application that allows customers to search for and view cars on their smartphones our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2012 more than 70 of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited our website 

we also maintain a website carmaxauctionscom that supports our wholesale auctions this website which is accessible only by authorized dealers provides listings of all vehicles that will be available in upcoming auctions it also has many features similar to our retail website including vehicle photos free vehicle history reports and vehicle search and alert capabilities 

suppliers for used vehicles we acquire used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our instore appraisal process and our carbuying centers as well as through other sources including local regional and online auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the supply of used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the rate of new vehicle sales which in turn generate usedcar tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry data there are approximately 240 million light vehicles in operation in the us including approximately 80 million vehicles that are 0 to 6 years old in recent years generally between 10 million and 17 million new vehicles and between 35 million and 45 million used vehicles have been retailed annually and between 8 million and 10 million vehicles have been remarketed at wholesale auctions each year 

our used vehicle inventory acquired directly from consumers through our appraisal process at our stores and carbuying centers helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the consumer preferences of each market we have replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which a carmaxtrained buyer appraises a customer’s vehicle and provides the owner with a written guaranteed offer that is good for seven days an appraisal is available to every customer free of charge whether or not the customer purchases a vehicle from us based on their age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this instore appraisal process meet our highquality retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our onsite wholesale auctions 

the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers who handle both onsite appraisals and offsite auction purchases our buyers evaluate all used vehicles based on internal and external auction data and market sales as well as estimated reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases transportation costs our buyers in collaboration with our home office staff utilize the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system to decide which inventory to purchase at offsite auctions our inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross profit per unit 

based on consumer acceptance of the instore appraisal process our experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

  

suppliers for new vehicles our new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales service and dealer agreements among other things these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies a manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances in addition to selling new vehicles using our low nohaggle price strategy the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow us to perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 

seasonality historically our business has been seasonal typically our superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter when used vehicles generally experience proportionately more of their annual depreciation we believe this is partly the result of a decline in customer traffic as well as discounts on model year closeouts that can pressure pricing for latemodel used vehicles customer traffic generally tends to slow in the fall as the weather changes and as customers shift their spending priorities we typically experience an increase in subprime traffic and sales in february and march coincident with tax refund season 

products and services 

merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices our used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as chrysler ford general motors honda hyundai kia mazda nissan subaru toyota and volkswagen and luxury brands such as acura bmw infiniti lexus and mercedesbenz our primary focus is vehicles that are 0 to 6 years old and generally range in price from 12000 to 32000 for the more costconscious consumer we also offer used cars that are more than 6 years old the mix of our used vehicle inventory by make model and age will vary from time to time depending on consumer preferences 

we have implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which we set nohaggle prices on both our used and new vehicles we believe that our pricing is competitive with the bestnegotiated prices in the market prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom and on applicable online classified sites on which they are listed we extend our nohaggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction including vehicle appraisal offers financing rates accessories and esp and gap pricing 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process this process includes a comprehensive certified quality inspection of the engine and all major systems including cooling fuel drivetrain transmission electronics suspension brakes steering air conditioning and other equipment as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle based on this quality inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our quality standards our technicians complete vehicle inspections we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services we engage third parties specializing in those services many superstores depend upon nearby typically larger superstores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead 

all carmax used car superstores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by our esps we also provide factoryauthorized service at all new car franchises we have developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that our retail repair service is conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as our other operations 

we believe that the efficiency of our reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by our modern facilities our information systems and our technician training and development process the training and development process and our compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of technicians identify opportunities for waste reduction and achieve highquality repairs our information systems provide the ability to track repair history and enable trend analysis which serves as guidance for our continuous improvement efforts 

wholesale auctions vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions as of february 29 2012 wholesale auctions were conducted at 52 of our 108 superstores and were generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned which depends on the number of stores in that market and the consumer awareness of carmax and our instore appraisal offer the typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers to participate in a carmax auction dealers must register with our centralized auction support group at which time we determine the purchase limit available to each dealer we provide condition disclosures on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major 

  

mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions the average auction sales rate was 96 in fiscal 2012 dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase 

customer credit we offer financing alternatives to customers throughout the credit spectrum through caf and our arrangements with several industryleading financial institutions we believe our program enables us to capture additional sales and enhances the carmax consumer offer credit applications are initially reviewed by caf customers who are not approved by caf may be evaluated by the other financial institutions having an array of finance sources increases discrete approvals expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to carmax in fiscal 2012 87 of our applicants received an approval from one or more of our sources we periodically test additional thirdparty providers 

customers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through our proprietary information system a majority of applicants receive a response within five minutes vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges thirdparty providers purchasing subprime finance contracts generally purchase these contracts at a discount while providers purchasing prime and nonprime finance contracts generally pay us a fixed prenegotiated fee per vehicle we have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers 

carmax auto finance we offer financing through caf to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at carmax caf utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment we offer customers an array of competitive rates and terms allowing them to choose the one that best fits their needs we randomly test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and 3day payoffs to assess market competitiveness after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 37 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2012 as of february 29 2012 caf serviced approximately 414000 customers in its 498 billion portfolio of managed receivables we maintain a dedicated website for caf wwwcarmaxautofinancecom through which customers can set up online payment plans and view and update account information 

extended service plans and guaranteed asset protection at the time of the sale we offer the customer an esp we sell these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors under the thirdparty service plan programs we have no contractual liability to the customer the esps we offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 72 months subject to mileage limitations and include multiple mileage and deductible options depending on the vehicle odometer reading make and model we offer esps at competitive fixed prices which are based primarily on the historical repair record of the vehicle make and model the mileage option selected and the deductible chosen all esps that we sell other than manufacturer programs have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements we receive a commission from the administrator at the time of sale in fiscal 2012 approximately 60 of the customers who purchased a used vehicle also purchased an esp 

our esp customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the quality of the services provided by this network as well as the broad scope of our esps helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

we also offer gap at the time of the sale gap is a product that will pay the difference between the customer’s insurance settlement and the finance contract payoff amount on their vehicle in the case of a total loss or unrecovered theft we sell this product on behalf of an unrelated third party that is the primary obligor and we have no contractual liability to the customer gap has been designed to our specifications and is administered by the third party through a privatelabel arrangement we receive a commission from the administrator at the time of sale 

systems 

our stores are supported by an advanced proprietary information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions using a computer or smartphone customers can search our entire vehicle inventory through our website carmaxcom they can also print a detailed listing for any vehicle from a computer which includes the vehicle’s features and specifications and its location on the display lot our integrated inventory management system tracks every vehicle through its life from purchase through reconditioning and testdrives to ultimate sale using radio frequency identification “rfid” tags all vehicles are scanned and tracked daily as a loss prevention measure testdrive information is also captured on 

  

every vehicle using rfid tags linking the specific vehicle and the sales consultant we also capture data on vehicles we wholesale which helps us track market pricing a computerized finance application process and computerassisted document preparation ensure rapid completion of the sales transaction behind the scenes our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity in addition our store system provides a direct link to our proprietary credit processing information system to facilitate the credit review and approval process of our inhouse financing and third party providers 

our proprietary inventory management and pricing system is centralized and allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each superstore this system also generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on complex algorithms that take into account factors including sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which minimizes the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit 

in addition to inventory management our electronic repair order system “ero” is used to sequence reconditioning procedures ero provides information that helps increase quality and reduce costs which further enhances our customer service and profitability 

through our centralized systems we are able to quickly integrate new stores into our store network we continue to enhance and refine our information systems which we believe to be a core competitive advantage the design of our information systems incorporates offsite backups redundant processing and other measures to reduce the risk of significant data loss in the event of an emergency or disaster

competition automotive retailing and wholesaling is a highly competitive business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices further new entrants to the market could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected retail and wholesale sales and margins competition is affected by the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles and provide vehicle financing the increasing use of the internet in the automotive retail and wholesale industry could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in addition caf and our thirdparty financing providers are subject to competition from various financial institutions 

retail prices any significant changes in retail prices for used and new vehicles could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations if any of our competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices for used or new vehicles we would likely reduce our prices in order to remain competitive which could result in a decrease in our sales and results of operations and require a change in our operating strategies 

inventory a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business a failure to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or a failure to recognize those trends could adversely affect our ability to acquire inventory should we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate the excess inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

regulatory and legislative environment we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as licensing requirements and laws regarding advertising vehicle sales financing and employment practices our facilities and business operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety the violation of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against business operations as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations further private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased their scrutiny of advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced 

recent federal legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms may result in an increase in expenses or a decrease in revenues for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 regulates among other things the provision of consumer financing and established a new consumer financial protection agency with broad regulatory powers this legislation and related regulation could have a material adverse effect on 

  

our results of operations the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as it is phased in over time significantly affects the provision of health care services and may impact the cost of providing our associates with health coverage current federal labor policy could lead to increased unionization efforts which could increase labor costs disrupt store operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

confidential customer information in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information and may share that information with our thirdparty service providers despite the security measures we have in place and the assurances we have from our thirdparty providers our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty service providers could be vulnerable to external or internal security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information whether experienced by us or by our thirdparty service providers and whether due to an external cybersecurity incident a programming error or other cause could damage our reputation expose us to mitigation costs and the risks of private litigation and government enforcement disrupt our business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations 

reputation our reputation as a company that is founded on the fundamental principle of integrity is critical to our success our reputation as a retailer offering highquality vehicles at competitive nohaggle prices with a customerfriendly sales process in attractive modern facilities is also critical to our success if we fail to maintain the high standards on which this reputation is built or if an event occurs that damages this reputation it could adversely affect consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations even the perception of a decrease in the quality of our brand could impact results accordingly if we fail to correct or mitigate misinformation or negative information including information spread through social media or normal media channels about the vehicles we offer our customer experience or any aspect of our brand it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

growth our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

management and workforce our success depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business our ability to meet our staffing needs while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changes in employment legislation competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and associate relations an inability to retain qualified associates or a significant increase in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

information systems our business is dependent upon the integrity and efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales inventory carmaxcom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in addition despite our ongoing efforts to maintain and enhance the integrity and security of these systems we could be subjected to attacks by hackers including denialofservice attacks directed at our websites or other system breaches or malfunctions due to associate error or misconduct or other disruptions such incidents could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on sales and results of operations 

accounting policies and matters we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain these policies are described in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 materially different amounts could be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions 

additionally the financial accounting standards board has proposed various rule changes including but not limited to accounting for leases the sec is also currently considering adopting rules that would require us issuers to prepare their financial statements contained in sec filings in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” as issued by the international accounting standards board the implementation of these or other new accounting requirements or other changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition 

  

litigation we are subject to various litigation matters which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

automotive manufacturers adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations manufacturer recalls could also adversely affect used vehicle sales or valuations and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of a recalled vehicle which could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

weather the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes or other natural disasters could cause store closures adversely affecting consumer traffic and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations in a given period 

seasonal fluctuations our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

geographic concentration our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large portion of our sales is generated in the southeastern us including florida and in texas southern california and washington dcbaltimore our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experienced a downturn in economic conditions it could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

other material events the occurrence of certain material events including acts of terrorism the outbreak of war or other significant national or international events could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations or financial condition

 item 2 properties tableend we conduct our used vehicle operations in two basic retail formats – production and nonproduction superstores production superstores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction superstore on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some superstores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction superstores until we expand our presence in that market as of february 29 2012 we operated 63 production superstores and 45 nonproduction superstores at that date we also operated one new car store which was located adjacent to our used car superstore in laurel maryland our remaining three new car franchises are operated as part of our used car superstores 

production superstores are generally 40000 to 60000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres but a few range from 70000 to 95000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres nonproduction superstores are generally 10000 to 25000 square feet on 4 to 12 acres 

u sed c ar s uperstores as of f ebruary 29 2012 

 

 as of february 29 2012 we leased 58 of our 108 used car superstores our new car store and our caf office building in atlanta georgia we owned the remaining 50 stores currently in operation we also owned our home office building in richmond virginia and land associated with planned future store openings 

  

expansion 

since opening our first used car superstore in 1993 we have grown organically through the construction and opening of companyoperated stores we do not franchise our operations as of february 29 2012 we operated 108 used car superstores in 53 us markets which represented approximately 50 of the us population we believe that further geographic expansion and additional fillin opportunities in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth 

in december 2008 we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment we resumed store growth in fiscal 2011 opening three superstores that year and five superstores in fiscal 2012 we plan to open 10 superstores in fiscal 2013 and between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following 3 fiscal years

in fiscal 2012 we revised our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to correct our accounting for saleleaseback transactions see note 2k for additional information as of march 1 2010 we adopted new accounting rules related to securitizations that affected the timing of the recognition of carmax auto finance “caf” income and resulted in the consolidation of the auto loan receivables and related nonrecourse notes payable that previously were reflected as offbalance sheet items the new rules were adopted on a prospective basis and prior year balances have not been restated see notes 2e 3 4 and 5 for additional information 

business overview 

general 

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we pioneered the used car superstore concept opening our first store in 1993 our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems as of february 29 2012 we operated 108 used car superstores in 53 markets comprising 41 midsized markets 11 large markets and 1 small market we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000 and 25 million people we also operated four new car franchises during fiscal 2012 we sold 408080 used cars representing 98 of the total 415759 vehicles we sold at retail 

we believe the carmax consumer offer is distinctive within the auto retailing marketplace our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other big box retailers our consumer offer is structured around our four customer benefits low nohaggle prices a broad selection high quality vehicles and a customerfriendly sales process our website carmaxcom is a valuable tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer a sophisticated search engine and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct their shopping online we generate revenues income and cash flows primarily by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing extended service plans “esps” a guaranteed asset protection “gap” product and vehicle repair service gap is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft 

we also generate revenues income and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards these vehicles are sold through onsite wholesale auctions wholesale auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis and as of february 29 2012 we conducted auctions at 52 used car superstores during fiscal 2012 we sold 316649 wholesale vehicles on average the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers 

carmax provides financing to qualified retail customers through caf our finance operation and our arrangements with several industryleading financial institutions as of february 29 2012 these third parties included capital one auto finance santander consumer usa wells fargo dealer services and american credit acceptance thirdparty providers purchasing subprime finance contracts generally purchase these contracts at a discount while providers purchasing prime and nonprime finance contracts generally pay us a fixed prenegotiated fee per contract we periodically test additional thirdparty providers we have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers 

we offer financing through caf to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at carmax caf utilizes proprietary customized scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment caf offers customers an array of competitive rates and terms 

  

allowing them to choose the ones that best fit their needs in addition customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges we randomly test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and 3day payoffs to assess market competitiveness after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 37 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2012 as of february 29 2012 caf serviced approximately 414000 customers in its 498 billion portfolio of managed receivables 

we sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors as of february 29 2012 the used vehicle thirdparty esp providers were cna national warranty corporation and the warranty group and the thirdparty gap provider was safeguard products international llc we have no contractual liability to the customer under these thirdparty plans esp revenue represents commissions received on the sale of esps and gap from the unrelated third parties 

over the long term we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and our inventory management practices reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit we employ a volumebased strategy and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement 

in december 2008 we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment we resumed store growth in fiscal 2011 opening three superstores that year and five superstores in fiscal 2012 we plan to open 10 superstores in fiscal 2013 and between 10 and 15 superstores in each of the following 3 fiscal years while we have more than 100 superstores we are still in the midst of the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 29 2012 we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 50 of the us population 

the principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to build our management bench strength to support our store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at favorable terms we staff each newly opened store with associates who have extensive carmax training therefore we must recruit train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings 

fiscal 2012 highlights 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving securitization program comprised of two warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf until they can be funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement as of march 1 2010 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” nos 200916 and 200917 on a prospective basis pursuant to these pronouncements we now recognize all transfers of auto loan receivables into either our warehouse facilities or term securitizations as secured borrowings which results in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets also pursuant to these pronouncements beginning in fiscal 2011 caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings no longer includes a gain on the sale of loans through securitization transactions but instead primarily reflects the interest and fee income associated with the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables direct caf expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses 

auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers primarily related to used retail vehicle sales financed through caf and are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance 

see notes 2e 2h 4 and 5 for additional information on auto loan receivables and securitizations 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer we recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered net of a reserve for returns under our 5day moneyback guarantee a reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

  

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle because we are not the primary obligor under these plans we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale net of a reserve for returns the reserve for cancellations is recorded based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future cancellations differ from historical averages 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted see note 9 for additional information on income taxes 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider available carrybacks future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 29 2012 will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination

 used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 the 9 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2012 resulted from a 5 increase in average retail selling price and a 3 increase in unit sales the growth in the average retail selling price primarily reflected increases in our acquisition costs which resulted from the yearoveryear increase in used vehicle wholesale industry values used vehicle valuations remained strong in fiscal 2012 as the overall supply of used vehicles being remarketed continued to be constrained following three years of new car industry sales at rates significantly below prerecession levels a shift in our sales mix moderated the effect of higher acquisition costs on our average retail selling price during fiscal 2012 5 to 10year old vehicles which generally have lower selling prices than latermodel vehicles represented an increased portion of our sales mix our sales mix by make model and vehicle age will vary from period to period reflecting changing consumer preferences 

the 3 increase in used unit sales included a 1 increase in comparable store used unit sales together with sales from superstores not yet included in the comparable store base we believe the modest rate of comparable store used unit sales growth reflected both a challenging sales comparison with fiscal 2011 when comparable store used unit sales increased 10 and the continuation of weak economic conditions and low consumer confidence for much 

  

of the current fiscal year while customer traffic at comparable stores was higher than in the prior year a larger portion of the current year traffic represented customers who only obtained vehicle appraisals which contributed to a decline in sales conversion 

our data indicated that we increased our share of the late model 0to 6year old used vehicle market by approximately 3 in fiscal 2012 we achieved market share growth despite a shift within the market for 0 to 6year old vehicles towards older used vehicles and having fewer immature stores those less than five years old in our store base due to our temporary suspension of store growth historically market share gains are strongest among immature stores we remain confident that the strength of our consumer offer and the skill of our associates combined with our resumption of store growth will continue to drive future share gains 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 the 16 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2011 resulted from an 11 increase in unit sales and a 5 increase in average retail selling price the 11 unit sales growth reflected a 10 increase in comparable store used unit sales combined with sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base the increase in comparable store unit sales primarily reflected the benefit of the continuing gradual rebound in customer traffic as well as an increase in the sales conversion rate we believe the sales conversion rate benefited from increased customer access to credit the increase in the average retail selling price primarily reflected increases in our vehicle acquisition costs resulting from appreciation in wholesale industry used vehicle values 

our data indicated that we increased our share of the latemodel used vehicle market by approximately 7 in fiscal 2011 we believe our ability to grow market share year after year is a reflection of the strength of our consumer offer the skill of our associates and the preference for our brand 

new vehicle sales 

as of february 29 2012 we had a total of four new car franchises representing the toyota nissan and chrysler brands in june 2011 we terminated the chrysler franchise at one of our los angeles used car superstores to provide additional space for used vehicle operations in october 2010 we ceased operations at our chevrolet franchise in kenosha wisconsin following the termination of this franchise by general motors these franchise terminations did not have a material effect on sales or earnings 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 new vehicle revenues increased 1 in fiscal 2012 reflecting an 8 increase in average retail selling price largely offset by a 7 reduction in new vehicle unit sales based on industry data new light vehicle sales increased 9 to 130 million units from 119 million units in fiscal 2011 although they remained significantly below the 16 million to 17 million unit range routinely achieved between 2000 and 2007 compared with industry sales trends our new vehicle unit sales were adversely affected by the chrysler franchise termination and the effect of temporary new vehicle supply shortages following the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami in japan these shortages had a disproportionate effect on our new vehicles sales given our brand mix 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 new vehicle revenues increased 6 in fiscal 2011 due to a 5 rise in unit sales and a 2 increase in average retail selling price the growth in our unit sales was achieved against a backdrop of improving new vehicle industry sales based on industry data new light vehicle industry sales increased 13 to 119 million units from 105 million units in fiscal 2010 the wind down of our chevrolet franchise which was one of many franchises terminated by general motors partially offset the growth in our new vehicle unit sales 

wholesale vehicle sales 

our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering highquality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles wholesaled 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 the 32 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2012 resulted from a 20 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 10 increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price the increase in unit sales primarily reflected a significant increase in appraisal traffic while the appraisal buy rate remained high relative to historical averages it declined modestly from the prior year our appraisal traffic benefited from the increase in customer traffic in our stores and from the lift in new car industry sales and related used vehicle tradein activity in fiscal 2012 

  

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 the 54 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2011 resulted from a 33 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 16 increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price the growth in unit sales reflected strong increases in both appraisal traffic and our appraisal buy rate our appraisal traffic benefited from the increase in customer traffic in our stores and from the lift in new car industry sales and related used vehicle tradein activity in fiscal 2011 we believe the strong wholesale pricing environment and the resulting increases in our appraisal offers had a favorable effect on the appraisal buy rate 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of esps and gap reported in esp revenues service department sales and net thirdparty finance fees for providers who pay us a fixed fee per vehicle financed this fee varies reflecting the differing levels of credit risk exposure the thirdparty providers who purchase subprime finance contracts generally purchase these contracts at a discount which is reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received on other thirdparty finance contracts 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 other sales and revenues declined 4 in fiscal 2012 as a 3 increase in esp revenues was more than offset by a decrease in thirdparty finance fees resulting from a mix change among providers subprime providers financed 10 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2012 compared with 8 in fiscal 2011 the reduction in thirdparty finance fees also reflected the decision by caf to retain an increased portion of the loans that thirdparty providers had been purchasing following caf’s tightening of lending standards beginning in fiscal 2010 as caf retained an increased portion of these loans the fees previously received from third parties declined we expect that this decision will be accretive to our earnings over time 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 other sales and revenues increased 8 in fiscal 2011 primarily fueled by an increase in esp revenues esp revenues climbed 20 reflecting the 11 growth in used unit sales and an increase in esp penetration due in part to refinements in the plan design implemented in fiscal 2011 esp revenues also benefited from a slowdown in the rate of esp cancellations and from having a full year of gap revenues in fiscal 2011 following the roll out of this product in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 service department sales were similar to the prior year as service resources were used primarily in reconditioning vehicles to support the retail unit sales growth net thirdparty finance fees declined as a result of a mix shift among providers the total percent of sales financed by the third parties increased in fiscal 2011 due in part to arrangements with these providers to purchase a portion of the loans that previously would have been originated by caf the increase in thirdparty penetration was more than offset however by the effect of an increase in the percentage of sales financed by our subprime financing providers the subprime providers financed 8 of retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2011 compared with 6 in fiscal 2010

  used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit we employ a volumebased strategy and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement when customer traffic and sales are consistently strong we generally take fewer pricing markdowns which in turn benefits gross profit dollars per unit when the sales pace slows we may initially take more pricing markdowns which could pressure gross profit dollars per unit however as we are successful in reducing inventories to align them with a slower sales pace this may allow us to return to target levels of gross profit per unit other factors that may influence gross profit include changes in our vehicle reconditioning costs changes in the percentage of vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process and changes in the wholesale pricing environment over the past several years we have continued to refine our carbuying strategies which we believe has benefited used vehicle gross profit per unit 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 used vehicle gross profit increased 345 million or 4 to 8886 million from 8540 million in fiscal 2011 reflecting the combination of the 3 increase in used unit sales and a 1 improvement in gross profit per unit used vehicle gross profit per unit increased 21 to 2177 per unit compared with 2156 per unit in fiscal 2011 our shift to selling an increased mix of 5 to 10year old vehicles in fiscal 2012 increased our average reconditioning cost per unit as older vehicles typically require more reconditioning effort however the older vehicles we sold were generally no less profitable than newer models 

in recent years we have worked to eliminate waste from our vehicle reconditioning process through the emphasis on the consistent application of reconditioning standards across our entire store base adjusting for the increase in average age of vehicles reconditioned and sold in fiscal 2012 we sustained the 250 per unit savings achieved in prior years 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 used vehicle gross profit increased 1142 million or 15 to 8540 million from 7399 million in fiscal 2010 reflecting the combination of the 11 increase in used unit sales and a 4 improvement in gross profit per unit used vehicle gross profit per unit increased 84 to 2156 per unit compared with 2072 per unit in fiscal 2010 

the improvement in gross profit per unit resulted from a combination of factors including benefits realized from our ongoing initiatives to improve vehicle reconditioning efficiency and reduce waste the support provided by the strong wholesale pricing environment and a modest increase in the percentage of retail vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction as of the end of fiscal 2011 we estimated our efforts to eliminate waste from our reconditioning processes in recent years have allowed us to achieve a sustainable reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately 250 per vehicle on a cumulative basis 

new vehicle gross profit 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 new vehicle gross profit increased to 65 million from 54 million in fiscal 2011 the improvement was the result of a 188 increase in gross profit per unit to 847 per unit from 659 per unit 

  

in fiscal 2011 partially offset by the 7 reduction in new vehicle unit sales new vehicle gross profit per unit benefited from a reduction in discounting by new car manufacturers and dealers in the months following the earthquake and tsunami in japan 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 new vehicle gross profit declined to 54 million from 67 million in fiscal 2010 the reduction occurred as the benefit of the 5 increase in new vehicle unit sales was more than offset by a 199 reduction in gross profit per unit to 659 per unit from 858 per unit in fiscal 2010 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale vehicle gross profit has steadily increased over the last several years reflecting in part the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our carbuying strategies appraisal delivery processes and instore auction processes we have made continuous improvements in these processes which we believe have allowed us to become more efficient our instore auctions have benefited from initiatives to increase our dealertocar ratio which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices in addition the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 630 million or 26 to 3018 million from 2388 million in fiscal 2011 the improvement reflected the 20 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 5 rise in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit increased 45 to 953 per unit from 908 per unit in fiscal 2011 the yearoveryear increase in industry pricing and strong dealer demand contributed to the improved wholesale gross profit per unit 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 673 million or 39 to 2388 million from 1715 million in fiscal 2010 the improvement reflected the 33 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 4 rise in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit increased 39 to 908 per unit from 869 per unit in fiscal 2010 the strength of our wholesale gross profit per unit reflected the strong demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to esp and gap revenues net thirdparty finance fees and the service department we have no cost of sales related to esp and gap revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent commissions paid to us by certain thirdparty providers net of the discount associated with the loans purchased by subprime providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition of other gross profit 

fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 other gross profit fell 210 million or 10 to 1819 million from 2030 million in fiscal 2011 as the 3 growth in esp profits was more than offset by lower thirdparty finance fees and service department profits the 146 million reduction in thirdparty finance fees reflected the mix shift among providers and the resulting increase in the share of finance contracts purchased by subprime providers as well as caf’s retention of loans that previously had been financed by thirdparty providers service department gross profit declined 122 million primarily due to the deleverage associated with increased service overhead costs the modest retail unit sales growth and lower service retail sales 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 other gross profit increased 221 million or 12 to 2030 million from 1808 million in fiscal 2010 esp and gap gross profit increased 293 million or 20 benefiting from the 11 increase in used unit sales the improved esp penetration rate and the prior year roll out of the gap product service department gross profit grew 29 million or 8 the increases in esp and gap and service department gross profits were partially offset by a 101 million reduction in net thirdparty finance fees which were adversely affected by the mix shift among providers 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not been a significant contributor to results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than by changes in average retail prices however increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit the sga ratio and caf income to the extent the average amount financed also increases 

during the last three fiscal years we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing we believe the appreciation resulted in part from the reduced supply of latemodel used vehicles in the market that was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle tradein 

  

activity compared with prerecession periods the higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our average selling prices for used and wholesale vehicles in fiscal 2012 we also experienced inflationary increases in key reconditioning cost components including tires and petroleumbased products 

carmax auto finance income 

caf provides financing for a portion of our used and new car retail sales because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers while financing can also be obtained from thirdparty sources we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk furthermore we believe that our processes and systems the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans both for caf and for the thirdparty financing providers generally caf has provided us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on thirdparty financing sources we also believe caf enables us to capture additional sales 

caf provides financing for qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest caf income primarily reflects the interest and fee income generated by the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the debt issued to fund these receivables direct caf expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses 

as described in the critical accounting policies section of this mda as of march 1 2010 we adopted asu nos 200916 and 200917 on a prospective basis as a result the basis on which caf income was recognized in fiscal 2010 and earlier periods is not directly comparable to the accounting for caf income in fiscal 2011 and subsequent years

  fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 caf’s average managed receivables increased 10 to 466 billion from 423 billion in fiscal 2011 on a net basis after the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed 37 of retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2012 versus 30 in fiscal 2011 net loans originated increased 32 to 284 billion from 215 billion in fiscal 2011 reflecting our decision to retain an increased portion of the loans that thirdparty providers had been purchasing since caf’s tightening of lending standards in fiscal 2010 as well as our 8 growth in retail vehicle revenues as of january 2012 caf had transitioned back to retaining all of these loans our decision to retain the loans that third parties had been purchasing primarily reflected our confidence in our ability to economically fund these loans we expect that this decision will be accretive to our earnings over time 

caf income increased 19 to 2622 million compared with 2200 million in fiscal 2011 the total interest margin which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs was 73 of average managed receivables in fiscal 2012 versus 67 in fiscal 2011 interest and fee income grew 296 million largely reflecting the growth in managed receivables as a percentage of managed receivables interest and fee income declined modestly to 96 from 99 in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting the effect of the amortization of older loans partly offset by the shift in the credit quality mix in more recent loan originations over the last few years the average contract rate charged on auto loans has gradually declined and older loans with higher contract rates have become a smaller portion of total managed receivables the weighted average contract rate on current loan originations increased slightly to 88 in fiscal 2012 from 87 in fiscal 2011 primarily reflecting our increased retention of higher risk loans during fiscal 2012 loans with higher risk are generally charged higher rates of interest see note 4 for additional information on the credit quality of auto loan receivables 

interest expense declined 277 million despite the growth in managed receivables the decline reflected the effects of the amortization of older highercost term securitizations and the increasing portion of managed receivables that have been funded with newer lowercost securitizations for the past two years caf has benefited from historically low funding costs in the assetbacked securitization market in a rising interest rate environment caf’s funding costs may rise more rapidly than consumer rates should this occur the compression in caf’s interest margin would be recognized over time 

the provision for loan losses increased to 364 million or 08 of average managed receivables from 277 million or 07 of average managed receivables in fiscal 2011 the increase in the provision primarily reflected the combination of the growth in average managed receivables and the cumulative effect of the origination and retention of loans with higher risk partly offset by favorable loss experience in fiscal 2012 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 caf’s average managed receivables increased 4 to 423 billion from 406 billion in fiscal 2010 on a net basis caf financed 30 of retail vehicle unit sales in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 net loans originated increased 17 to 215 billion from 184 billion in fiscal 2010 primarily reflecting our 16 growth in total retail vehicle revenues 

caf reported income of 2200 million in fiscal 2011 the total interest margin was 67 of total average managed receivables reflecting the wide spreads between interest rates charged to consumers and our related funding costs caf’s portfolio of managed receivables reflected a favorable interest rate environment in which funding costs declined more rapidly than consumer rates 

prior to march 1 2010 securitization transactions were accounted for as sales a gain recorded at the time of securitization resulted from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables other gain included the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous fiscal periods and changes in the 

  

valuation of retained subordinated bonds as applicable caf income also included servicing fee income on securitized receivables and interest income which included the effective yield on the retained interest as well as interest income earned on the retained subordinated bonds between january 2008 and april 2009 we retained some or all of the subordinated bonds associated with our term securitizations 

caf reported income of 1752 million in fiscal 2010 including 267 million or 007 per share of net favorable adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal years the adjustments included 640 million of marktomarket adjustments primarily on the retained subordinated bonds partially offset by a 562 million increase in funding costs related to auto loans originated in prior fiscal years the gain on loans originated and sold in fiscal 2010 benefited from an increasing spread between consumer rates and caf’s funding cost and the tightening of caf lending standards in fiscal 2010 which reduced expected net loss and discount rate assumptions used to value the gain income

  the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in our portfolio of managed receivables as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic expense of maintaining an adequate allowance 

the allowance for loan losses was 09 of ending managed receivables as of both february 29 2012 and february 28 2011 as favorable loss experience in the current year largely offset the cumulative effect of originating an increased mix of loans with greater credit risk during fiscal 2012 we expect the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of managed receivables will increase in future years as the higher credit risk loans become a larger percentage of managed receivables

 in fiscal 2012 we experienced improvements in both past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables and net credit losses as a percentage of total average managed receivables we believe the improvements were the result of several factors including our credit tightening implemented in fiscal 2010 the strong recovery rates and general industry trends for losses and delinquencies 

the average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42 to a high of 60 and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment

   fiscal 2012 versus fiscal 2011 sga expenses increased 7 to 9408 million from 8788 million in fiscal 2011 the increase in sga expense was driven by the expansion of our store base higher growthrelated costs increases in sales commissions and other variable costs and an increase in advertising expense growthrelated costs include store preopening expenses relocation expenses and the costs of maintaining store management bench strength to support future growth sga per used unit rose 4 to 2305 from 2218 in fiscal 2011 sga expenses as a percent of net sales and operating revenues the “sga ratio” fell to 94 from 98 in fiscal 2011 reflecting the leverage associated with the increases in used and wholesale unit sales and average selling prices 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 sga expenses increased 11 to 8788 million from 7922 million in fiscal 2010 the increase in sga was consistent with the increase in used unit sales and it primarily reflected increases in sales commissions and other variable costs associated with the growth in unit sales and higher advertising costs as well as costs associated with our resumption of store growth the increase also reflected the absence of a favorable litigation settlement included in sga in the prior year which increased fiscal 2010 net earnings by 002 per diluted share sga per used unit was 2218 in both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the sga ratio improved to 98 from 106 in fiscal 2010 reflecting the leverage associated with the increases in retail and wholesale unit sales and average selling prices

lease accounting revisions 

in fiscal 2012 we revised our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to correct our accounting for saleleaseback transactions entered into between 1995 and 2009 as a result of the revision we have recorded certain of the assets subject to the saleleaseback transactions on our consolidated balance sheets in property plant and equipment and the related sales proceeds as finance lease obligations depreciation is being recognized on the assets payments on the leases are now recognized as interest expense and a reduction of the obligations rather than being recognized as rent expense we have determined that our financial statements were not materially affected by the revision as a result of the correction reported net earnings per share were reduced by 002 in each of fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the corrections also increased total assets by 2856 million and total liabilities by 3380 million and reduced total shareholders’ equity by 524 million as of february 28 2011 operating cash flows were improved by 104 million in fiscal 2011 and 92 million in fiscal 2010 and financing cash flows were reduced by equal amounts see note 2k for additional information 

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

the combined effects of the adoption of asu nos 200916 and 200917 and the march 1 2010 amendment to our then existing warehouse facility agreement represent noncash transactions and thus the reported cash flow information for fiscal 2011 takes into account the effect of these and other related reclassifications and adjustments see note 2e for additional information on the effects of the accounting change 

operating activities in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 net cash used in operating activities totaled 622 million and 68 million respectively while in fiscal 2010 net cash provided by operating activities totaled 595 million in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 these amounts included increases in auto loan receivables of 6757 million and 3047 million respectively as discussed in note 2e auto loan receivables and the related cash flows were not reported in the consolidated financial statements prior to fiscal 2011 the increase in auto loan receivables primarily reflected the amount by which caf net loan originations exceeded loan repayments during the applicable year caf auto loan receivables are funded through securitization transactions as a result the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are reflected as cash provided by financing activities 

inventory totaled 109 billion as of the end of fiscal 2012 105 billion as of the end of fiscal 2011 and 8431 million as of the end of fiscal 2010 the 4 increase in inventory during fiscal 2012 included a 7 increase in used vehicle inventory partially offset by a reduction in new vehicle inventory the increase in used vehicle inventory reflected the combination of additional used units to support the five stores opened during fiscal 2012 and 

  

higher vehicle acquisition costs resulting from the rise in wholesale vehicle valuations the reduction in new vehicle inventory was primarily due to our termination of a chrysler franchise in june 2011 the 24 increase in inventory during fiscal 2011 was attributable to the combination of an 18 increase in used vehicle units in inventory and the rise in vehicle acquisition costs the increase in units reflected the additional vehicles required to support strong sales trends at the end of fiscal 2011 as well as the effect of the three stores opened during that year 

we utilize derivative instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the future known receipt or payment of uncertain cash amounts the values of which are impacted by interest rates prior to march 1 2010 no derivative instruments were designated as accounting hedges as we believed this treatment was best aligned with our use of gainonsale accounting for auto loan receivable securitizations in conjunction with the adoption of the new accounting rules related to securitizations as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 we now enter into derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk as we believe this treatment is better aligned with our current accounting policies 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 2194 million in fiscal 2012 722 million in fiscal 2011 and 213 million in fiscal 2010 investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled 1726 million in fiscal 2012 766 million in fiscal 2011 and 224 million in fiscal 2010 capital expenditures include real estate acquisition and store construction costs for planned future store openings we strive to maintain a multiyear pipeline of store sites to support our store growth so portions of capital spending in one year may relate to stores to be opened in subsequent fiscal years the increases in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 primarily reflected our resumption of store growth in fiscal 2011 and the ramp in planned store openings from 3 stores in fiscal 2011 to 5 stores in fiscal 2012 and 10 stores planned for fiscal 2013 as well as the 10 to 15 stores planned for each of the following 3 fiscal years in fiscal 2010 capital spending primarily represented expenditures required to maintain our existing structures that were capital in nature these expenditures were fairly modest because of the relatively young average age of our store base 

historically capital expenditures have been funded with internallygenerated funds debt and saleleaseback transactions no saleleasebacks were conducted during the last three fiscal years 

as of february 29 2012 we owned 50 and leased 58 of our 108 used car superstores 

restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables increased 433 million in fiscal 2012 compared with a 16 million decrease in fiscal 2011 these collections vary depending on the timing of the receipt of principal and interest payments on securitized auto loan receivables the change in average managed receivables and the funding vehicle utilized 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled 6831 million in fiscal 2012 and 1018 million in fiscal 2011 included in these amounts were net increases in total nonrecourse notes payable of 6704 million in fiscal 2012 and 1873 million in fiscal 2011 which were used to provide the financing for the majority of the increases of 6757 million and 3047 million respectively in auto loan receivables as discussed in note 2e nonrecourse notes payable and the related cash flows were not reported in the consolidated financial statements prior to fiscal 2011 net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2011 also included a 1215 million net reduction in borrowings under the revolving credit facility in fiscal 2010 net cash used in financing activities totaled 1605 million which included a 1860 million net reduction in borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the reductions in borrowings under the revolving credit facility reflected the use of excess cash to pay down debt as well as our relatively low levels of capital spending resulting from our temporary suspension of store growth

 we have a 700 million unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in august 2016 the credit facility contains representations and warranties conditions and covenants as of february 29 2012 we were in compliance with the covenants borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and the unused portion is fully available to us as of february 29 2012 09 million of shortterm debt was outstanding under the credit facility 

caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles 

during fiscal 2012 we completed four term securitizations funding a total of 292 billion of auto loan receivables as of february 29 2012 the combined warehouse facility limit was 16 billion at that date 5530 million of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facilities and unused warehouse capacity totaled 105 billion of the combined warehouse facility limit 800 million will expire in august 2012 and 800 million will expire in february 2013 the securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various financial covenants as of february 29 2012 we were in compliance with the financial covenants see notes 5 and 11 for additional information on the warehouse facilities 

finance and capital lease obligations primarily relate to superstores subject to saleleaseback transactions most of these leases had initial terms ranging from 15 to 20 years with additional optional renewal periods ranging from 5 to 20 years certain of the leased assets are accounted for using the financing method where the related sales proceeds are recognized as finance obligations and a portion of the periodic lease payments reduce the obligations the remaining leased assets are accounted for as operating leases 

cash received on equity issuances which primarily related to employee stock option exercises totaled 156 million in fiscal 2012 383 million in fiscal 2011 and 313 million in fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the receipts included exercises prompted by the increase in our stock price during those years 

we expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements saleleaseback transactions and borrowings under existing new or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund caf capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing funding arrangements to meet our future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend auto loan receivables 

as of february 29 2012 and february 28 2011 all loans in our portfolio of managed receivables were fixedrate installment contracts financing for these receivables was achieved through asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and floatingrate securities our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies other receivables are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments see notes 6 and 7 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities

   interest rate exposure 

we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility substantially all of these borrowing are floatingrate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2012 net earnings per share by less than 001 

borrowings under our warehouse facilities are also floating rate debt generally based on commercial paper rates and are secured by auto loan receivables on which we collect interest at fixed rates the receivables are funded through the warehouse facilities until they can be funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement this floatingrate risk is mitigated by funding the receivables through a term securitization or other funding arrangement and by entering into derivative instruments

carmax inc “we” “our” “us” “carmax” and “the company” including its wholly owned subsidiaries is the largest retailer of used vehicles in the united states we were the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality used vehicles at competitively low nohaggle prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility at select locations we also sell new vehicles under various franchise agreements we provide customers with a full range of related products and services including the financing of vehicle purchases through carmax auto finance “caf” our own finance operation and thirdparty financing providers the sale of extended service plans “esp” guaranteed asset protection “gap” and accessories the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers and vehicle repair service vehicles purchased through the appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through onsite wholesale auctions 

 

 

 

 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of carmax and our wholly owned subsidiaries all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities actual results could differ from those estimates amounts and percentages may not total due to rounding 

 

 

cash equivalents of 239 million as of february 28 2011 and 05 million as of february 28 2010 consisted of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 

 

 

cash accounts totaling 1611 million as of february 28 2011 consisted of collections of principal and interest payments on securitized auto loan receivables that are restricted for payment to the securitization investors pursuant to the applicable securitization agreements 

 

 

accounts receivable net of an allowance for doubtful accounts include certain amounts due from thirdparty finance companies and customers from new car manufacturers for incentives from third parties for warranty reimbursements and for other miscellaneous receivables the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience and trends 

 

 

as of march 1 2010 we adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards update “asu” nos 200916 and 200917 formerly statements of financial accounting standards nos 166 and 167 respectively on a prospective basis asu no 200916 amended fasb accounting standards codification “asc” topic 860 “transfers and servicing” and asu no 200917 amended fasb asc topic 810 “consolidation” asu no 200916 removed the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity “qspe” from topic 860 and removed the provision within topic 810 exempting these entities from consolidation these pronouncements also clarified the requirements for isolation and the limitations on the portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting treatment 

 

pursuant to these pronouncements we recognize transfers of auto loan receivables into term securitizations as secured borrowings which results in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable to the investors on our consolidated balance sheets all transfers of receivables into our warehouse facilities on or after march 1 2010 are also accounted for as secured borrowings as of march 1 2010 we amended our warehouse facility agreement in effect as of that date as a result auto loan receivables previously securitized through that warehouse facility no longer qualify for sale treatment because under the amendment carmax now has effective control over the receivables the receivables that were funded in the warehouse facility at that date were consolidated at their fair value along with the related nonrecourse notes payable to the investors 

 

 

 

  

  

 

the table below shows the combined effects of the adoption of asu nos 200916 and 200917 and the march 1 2010 amendment to our existing warehouse facility agreement on our february 28 2010 consolidated balance sheets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the adjustments in the above table include the following items 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

beginning in fiscal 2011 caf income no longer includes a gain on the sale of loans through securitization transactions but instead primarily reflects the interest and certain other income associated with the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the nonrecourse notes payable issued to fund these receivables direct caf expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses see notes 3 and 5 for additional information on securitizations 

 

 

  

  

 

 

due to the shortterm nature andor variable rates associated with these financial instruments the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable restricted cash and investments accounts payable shortterm debt and longterm debt approximates fair value our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value see note 7 for additional information on fair value measurements 

 

 

inventory is primarily comprised of vehicles held for sale or currently undergoing reconditioning and is stated at the lower of cost or market vehicle inventory cost is determined by specific identification parts and labor used to recondition vehicles as well as transportation and other incremental expenses associated with acquiring and reconditioning vehicles are included in inventory certain manufacturer incentives and rebates for new car inventory including holdbacks are recognized as a reduction to new car inventory when we purchase the vehicles 

 

 

auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers primarily related to used retail vehicle sales financed through caf and are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in the portfolio as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the underlying economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance 

 

an account is considered delinquent when the related customer fails to make a substantial portion of a scheduled payment on or before the due date when an account is 75 days past due the related vehicle is automatically eligible for repossession accounts are chargedoff on the last business day of the month during which the earliest of the following occurs the receivable is 120 days or more delinquent the related vehicle is repossessed and liquidated or the receivable is otherwise deemed uncollectible for purposes of determining impairment auto loans are evaluated collectively as they represent a large group of smallerbalance homogeneous loans and therefore are not individually evaluated for impairment see note 4 for additional information on auto loan receivables 

 

interest income and expenses related to auto loans are included in caf income interest income on auto loan receivables is recognized when earned based on contractual loan terms all loans continue to accrue interest until repayment or chargeoff direct costs associated with loan originations are not considered material see note 3 for a summary of caf income 

 

 

property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straightline method over the shorter of the assets estimated useful life or the lease term if applicable property held under capital lease is stated at the lesser of the present value of the future minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease or fair value amortization of capital lease assets is computed on a straightline basis over the shorter of the initial lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset and is included in depreciation expense costs incurred during new store construction are capitalized as constructioninprogress and reclassified to the appropriate fixed asset categories when the store is completed 

 

estimated useful lives 

 

 

we review longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable we recognize impairment when the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset in fiscal 2010 we recognized an impairment of 21 million related to an asset within land held for sale no impairment of longlived assets resulted from our impairment tests in fiscal 2011 or fiscal 2009 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

computer software costs we capitalize external direct costs of materials and services used in and payroll and related costs for employees directly involved in the development of internaluse software we amortize amounts capitalized on a straightline basis over five years 

 

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangibles had a carrying value of 101 million as of february 28 2011 and 2010 we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets resulted from our annual impairment tests in fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 

 

restricted cash on deposit in reserve accounts the restricted cash on deposit in reserve accounts is for the benefit of the securitization investors in the event that the cash generated by the securitized receivables in a given period was insufficient to pay the interest principal and other required payments the balances on deposit in the reserve accounts would be used to pay those amounts these funds are restricted for the benefit of holders of nonrecourse notes payable and are not expected to be available to the company or its creditors restricted cash on deposit in reserve accounts was 450 million as of february 28 2011 prior to march 1 2010 the amount on deposit in reserve accounts was a component of retained interest in securitized receivables see note 5 for additional information on securitizations 

 

restricted investments restricted investments consist of money market securities associated with certain insurance programs due to the shortterm nature andor variable rates associated with these financial instruments the carrying value approximates fair value restricted investments included 267 million in money market securities as of february 28 2011 and 307 million as of february 28 2010 for fiscal 2011 there were no proceeds from the sales of other debt securities for fiscal 2010 proceeds from the sales of other debt securities totaled 22 million 

 

 

as of february 28 2011 and 2010 accrued expenses and other current liabilities included accrued compensation and benefits of 659 million and 621 million respectively and loss reserves for general liability and workers’ compensation insurance of 216 million and 239 million respectively 

 

 

the recognized funded status of defined benefit retirement plan obligations is included both in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and in other liabilities the current portion represents benefits expected to be paid from our benefit restoration plan over the next 12 months the defined benefit retirement plan obligations are determined by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by carmax key assumptions used in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate rate of return on plan assets and mortality rate 

 

 

insurance liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities we use a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for a number of risks including workers compensation general liability and employeerelated health care costs a portion of which is paid by associates estimated insurance liabilities are determined by considering historical claims experience demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions 

 

 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the retail vehicles we sell with a 5day moneyback guarantee if a customer returns the vehicle purchased within the parameters of the guarantee we will refund the customers money we record a reserve for returns based on historical experience and trends 

 

we sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties the esps we offer on all used vehicles provide coverage up to 72 months subject to mileage limitations while gap covers the customer for the term of their finance contract because we are not the primary obligor under these plans we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale net of a reserve for estimated customer returns the reserve for returns is based on historical experience and trends 

 

we collect sales taxes and other taxes from customers on behalf of governmental authorities at the time of sale these taxes are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net sales and operating revenues or cost of sales 

 

 

  

  

 

 

cost of sales includes the cost to acquire vehicles and the reconditioning and transportation costs associated with preparing the vehicles for resale it also includes payroll fringe benefits and parts and repair costs associated with reconditioning and vehicle repair services we recognize volumebased incentives related to new vehicles as a reduction to cost of sales when we determine the achievement of qualifying sales volumes is probable 

 

 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses primarily include payroll expenses other than payroll related to reconditioning and vehicle repair services fringe benefits rent and occupancy costs advertising and other general expenses 

 

 

advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sga expenses advertising expenses were 962 million in fiscal 2011 751 million in fiscal 2010 and 1015 million in fiscal 2009 advertising expenses were 11 of net sales and operating revenues for fiscal 2011 10 for fiscal 2010 and 15 for fiscal year 2009 

 

 

costs related to store openings including preopening costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sga expenses 

 

 

sharebased compensation represents the cost related to sharebased awards granted to employees and nonemployee directors we measure sharebased compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and we recognize the cost on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures over the grantee’s requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the award we estimate the fair value of stock options using a binomial valuation model key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of options are dividend yield expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected term the fair value of restricted stock is based on the volumeweighted average market value on the date of the grant the fair value of stocksettled restricted stock units is determined using a montecarlo simulation based on the expected market price of our common stock on the vesting date and the expected number of converted common shares cashsettled restricted stock units are liability awards with fair value measurement based on the market price of carmax common stock as of the end of each reporting period sharebased compensation expense is recorded in either cost of sales caf income or sga expenses based on the recipients’ respective function 

 

we record deferred tax assets for awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns based on the amount of compensation expense recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a deduction differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on the income tax return are recorded in capital in excess of par value if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset or in the consolidated statements of earnings if the deferred tax asset exceeds the tax deduction and no capital in excess of par value exists from previous awards 

 

 

we enter into derivative instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the future known receipt or payment of uncertain cash amounts the values of which are determined by interest rates we recognize the derivatives at fair value as either current assets or current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets where applicable such contracts covered by master netting agreements are reported net gross positive fair values are netted with gross negative fair values by counterparty the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting we may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain risks even though hedge accounting may not apply or we do not elect to apply hedge accounting see note 6 for additional information on derivative instruments and hedging activities 

 

 

we file a consolidated federal income tax return for a majority of our subsidiaries certain subsidiaries are required to file separate partnership or corporate federal income tax returns deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes measured by applying currently enacted tax laws a deferred tax asset is recognized if it is more likely than not that a benefit will be realized changes in tax laws and tax rates are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which the changes are enacted 

 

 

 

  

  

 

we recognize tax liabilities when despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities benefits from tax positions are measured at the highest tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement the current portion of these tax liabilities is included in accrued income taxes and any noncurrent portion is included in other liabilities to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded the differences impact income tax expense in the period in which the determination is made interest and penalties related to income tax matters are included in sga expenses 

 

 

basic net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings less earnings allocated to participating securities by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding diluted net earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings less earnings allocated to participating securities by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and dilutive potential common stock see note 13 for additional information on net earnings per share 

 

 

we sell used and new vehicles the diversity of our customers and suppliers and the highly fragmented nature of the us automotive retail market reduce the risk that nearterm changes in our customer base sources of supply or competition will have a severe impact on our business however unanticipated events could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

 

in january 2010 the fasb issued an additional accounting pronouncement related to fair value measurements fasb asc topic 820 which requires fair value hierarchy disclosures to be further disaggregated by class of assets and liabilities a class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item on the consolidated balance sheets in addition significant transfers in and out of levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for the transfers will be required to be disclosed this provision of the pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2009 accordingly we adopted the provision as of march 1 2010 with no significant transfers other than the effects of adopting asu nos 200916 and 200917 an additional provision effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2010 requires that the reconciliation of level 3 activity present information about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis instead of as one net number if applicable we will include the additional required disclosures for our fiscal year beginning march 1 2011 

 

in july 2010 the fasb issued an additional accounting pronouncement related to receivables fasb asc topic 310 which requires additional disclosures about a company’s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of the company’s financing receivables for disclosures as of the end of a reporting period this pronouncement is effective for reporting periods ending after december 15 2010 we have included the additional required disclosures in our annual report for our fiscal year ending february 28 2011 for disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period this pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2010 we will include additional required disclosures for our fiscal year beginning march 1 2011 

 

in december 2010 the fasb issued an accounting pronouncement related to intangibles – goodwill and other fasb asc topic 350 which requires a company to consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist in performing step 2 of the impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts the provisions for this pronouncement are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2010 with no early adoption we will adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning march 1 2011 the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

 

in december 2010 the fasb issued an accounting pronouncement related to business combinations fasb asc topic 805 which requires a company to disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only in comparative financial statements the disclosure provisions are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2010 with early adoption permitted if applicable we will include the required disclosures for our fiscal year beginning march 1 2011 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

caf provides financing for qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest we securitize substantially all of the loans originated by caf as discussed in note 5 beginning in fiscal 2011 caf income no longer includes a gain on the sale of loans through securitization transactions but instead primarily reflects the interest and certain other income associated with the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the nonrecourse notes payable issued to fund these receivables direct caf expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses 

 

prior to march 1 2010 the majority of caf income was typically generated by the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and the related funding cost for loans originated during the period a gain recorded at the time of securitization resulted from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables the cash flows were calculated taking into account expected prepayments losses and funding costs the gain on sales of loans originated and sold included both the gain income recorded at the time of securitization and the effect of any subsequent changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs that were incurred in the same fiscal period that the loans were originated other gains or losses included the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous fiscal periods the effects of new term securitizations and changes in the valuation of retained subordinated bonds as applicable 

 

caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs or income we present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefits or costs that could be attributed to caf examples of indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources administrative services marketing information systems accounting legal treasury and executive payroll 

 

  

  

 

 

auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers primarily related to used retail vehicle sales financed through caf and are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses we use securitization warehouse facilities to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf until they are funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement see note 5 for additional information on securitizations 

 

auto loan receivables net 

 

 

 

 

past due receivables 

 

 

 

 

credit quality when customers apply for financing caf uses proprietary scoring models that rely on the customers’ prior credit history and certain application information to evaluate and rank their risk prior credit history is obtained from credit bureau reporting agencies and includes information such as number age type of and payment history for prior or existing credit accounts the application information that is used includes income collateral value and down payment our scoring models yield credit grades that represent the relative likelihood of repayment customers assigned a grade of “a” are determined to have the highest probability of repayment and customers assigned a lower grade are determined to have a lower probability of repayment for loans that are approved the credit grade influences the terms of the agreement such as the required loantovalue ratio and interest rate 

 

 

 

  

  

 

caf uses a combination of the initial credit grades and historical performance to monitor the credit quality of the auto loan receivables on an ongoing basis we validate the accuracy of the scoring models periodically loan performance is reviewed on a recurring basis to identify whether the assigned grades are adequately reflecting the customers’ likelihood of repayment 

 

ending managed receivables by major credit grade 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

securitization financing we maintain a revolving securitization program comprised of two warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” that we use to fund auto loan receivables originated by caf until they are funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement we sell the auto loan receivables to a wholly owned bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that transfers an undivided percentage ownership interest in the receivables but not the receivables themselves to entities formed by thirdparty investors “bank conduits” the bank conduits issue assetbacked commercial paper supported by the transferred receivables and the proceeds from the sale of the commercial paper are used to finance the securitized receivables 

 

the bank conduits may be considered variable interest entities but are not consolidated because our interest does not constitute a variable interest in the entities we hold a variable interest in specified assets transferred to the entities rather than interests in the entities themselves 

 

we typically use term securitizations to refinance the auto loan receivables previously securitized through the warehouse facilities the purpose of term securitizations is to provide longterm funding for these receivables in these transactions a pool of auto loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose securitization trust the securitization trust issues assetbacked securities secured or otherwise supported by the transferred receivables and the proceeds from the sale of the assetbacked securities are used to finance the securitized receivables refinancing receivables in a term securitization could have an impact on our results of operations depending on the transaction structure and market conditions 

 

the warehouse facilities and the term securitizations are governed by various legal documents that limit and specify the activities of the special purpose entities and term securitization trusts collectively “securitization vehicles” used to facilitate the securitizations the securitization vehicles are generally allowed to acquire the receivables being sold to them issue assetbacked securities to investors to fund the acquisition of the receivables and enter into derivatives or other yield maintenance contracts to hedge or mitigate certain risks related to the pool of receivables or assetbacked securities additionally the securitization vehicles are required to service the receivables they hold and the securities they have issued these servicing functions are performed by carmax as appointed within the underlying legal documents servicing functions include but are not limited to collecting payments from borrowers monitoring delinquencies liquidating assets investing funds until distribution remitting payments to the trustee who in turn remits payments to the investors and accounting for and reporting information to investors 

 

the securitized receivables can only be used as collateral to settle obligations of the securitization vehicles the securitization vehicles and investors have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables we have not provided financial or other support to the securitization vehicles or investors that was not previously contractually required there are no additional arrangements guarantees or other commitments that could require us to provide financial support to the securitization vehicles 

 

financial covenants and performance triggers the securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various financial covenants and performance triggers the financial covenants include a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio performance triggers require that the pools of securitized receivables in the warehouse facilities achieve specified thresholds related to loss and delinquency rates if these financial covenants andor thresholds are not met we could be unable to continue to securitize receivables through the warehouse facilities in addition the warehouse facility investors would charge us a higher rate of interest and could have us replaced as servicer further we could be required to deposit collections on the securitized receivables with the warehouse facility agents on a daily basis and deliver executed lockbox 

  

  

  

  

  

agreements to the warehouse facility agents as of february 28 2011 we were in compliance with the financial covenants and the securitized receivables were in compliance with the performance triggers 

 

continuing involvement with securitized receivables we continue to manage the auto loan receivables that we securitize we receive servicing fees of approximately 1 of the outstanding principal balance of the securitized receivables we believe that the servicing fees specified in the securitization agreements adequately compensate us for servicing the securitized receivables no servicing asset or liability has been recorded 

 

transition effective march 1 2010 all transfers of auto loan receivables related to the warehouse facilities are accounted for as secured borrowings these transfers represent only a portion of the auto loan receivables and this portion does not meet the definition of a participating interest because our interest in the transferred receivables is subordinate to the interest of the investors in the bank conduits 

 

as of march 1 2010 we amended our warehouse facility agreement in effect as of that date as a result auto loan receivables previously securitized through that warehouse facility no longer qualify for sale treatment because under the amendment carmax now has effective control over the receivables the receivables that were funded in the warehouse facility at that date were consolidated at their fair value along with the related nonrecourse notes payable to the investors 

 

with the removal of the qspe consolidation exemption from fasb asc topic 810 effective march 1 2010 we are required to evaluate existing and future term securitization trusts for consolidation in our capacity as servicer we have the power to direct the activities of the trusts that most significantly impact the economic performance of the receivables in addition we have the obligation to absorb losses subject to limitations and the rights to receive any returns of the trusts which could be significant accordingly we are the primary beneficiary of the trusts and are required to consolidate them effective march 1 2010 the auto loan receivables securitized through the term securitization trusts were consolidated at their unpaid principal balances as of that date net of an allowance for loan losses along with the related nonrecourse notes payable to the investors 

 

see note 2e for a summary of the combined effects of the adoption of asu nos 200916 and 200917 and the march 1 2010 amendment to our existing warehouse facility agreement 

 

as of february 28 2011 433 billion in ending managed receivables were reported in accordance with fasb asc topic 810 this amount serves as collateral for the related nonrecourse notes payable of 401 billion as of the same date see notes 4 and 11 for additional information on auto loan receivables and nonrecourse notes payable 

 

retained interest prior to march 1 2010 all transfers of auto loan receivables were accounted for as sales when the receivables were securitized we recognized a gain on the sale and retained an interest in the receivables that were securitized the retained interest included the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables or “interestonly strip receivables” various reserve accounts required excess receivables and retained subordinated bonds as of february 28 2011 there was no retained interest as all transfers of auto loan receivables were accounted for as secured borrowings 

 

as part of the adoption of asu nos 200916 and 200917 as of march 1 2010 any retained interest related to term securitizations was either eliminated or reclassified generally to auto loan receivables accrued interest receivable or restricted cash on march 1 2010 we also amended our existing warehouse facility agreement however this did not result in the elimination or reclassification of the retained interest related to the receivables that were funded in the warehouse facility as of that date in may 2010 we repurchased the remaining portion of those receivables and resecuritized them through our second warehouse facility established in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as a result the retained interest related to these receivables was either eliminated or reclassified at that time see note 11 for additional information on our warehouse facilities 

 

 

  

  

 

fiscal 2010 securitization information 

 

except as noted the following disclosures apply to our securitization activities prior to march 1 2010 when transfers of auto loan receivables were accounted for as sales 

 

the fair value of the retained interest was 5524 million as of february 28 2010 and the receivables underlying the retained interest had a weighted average life of 15 years as of that date the weighted average life in periods for example months or years of prepayable assets was calculated by multiplying the principal collections expected in each future period by the number of periods until that future period summing those products and dividing the sum by the initial principal balance 

  

interestonly strip receivables interestonly strip receivables represented the present value of residual cash flows we expected to receive over the life of the securitized receivables the value of these receivables was determined by estimating the future cash flows using our assumptions of key factors such as finance charge income loss rates prepayment rates funding costs and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk the value of interestonly strip receivables could have been affected by external factors such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers changes in the strength of the economy and developments in the interest rate and credit markets therefore actual performance could have differed from these assumptions we evaluated the performance of the receivables relative to these assumptions on a regular basis any financial impact resulting from a change in performance was recognized in earnings in the period in which it occurred effective march 1 2010 interestonly strip receivables are no longer reported on the consolidated balance sheets 

 

reserve accounts we are required to fund various reserve accounts established for the benefit of the securitization investors in the event that the cash generated by the securitized receivables in a given period was insufficient to pay the interest principal and other required payments the balances on deposit in the reserve accounts would be used to pay those amounts in general each of our term securitizations requires that an amount equal to a specified percentage of the original balance of the securitized receivables be deposited in a reserve account on the closing date an amount equal to a specified percentage of funded receivables is also required for our warehouse facilities any excess cash generated by the receivables must be used to fund the reserve account to the extent necessary to maintain the required amount if the amount on deposit in the reserve account exceeds the required amount the excess is released to us in the term securitizations the amount required to be on deposit in the reserve account must equal or exceed a specified floor amount the reserve account remains funded until the investors are paid in full at which time the remaining balance is released to us as of february 28 2010 the amount on deposit in reserve accounts was 474 million effective march 1 2010 the amount on deposit in reserve accounts is reported as restricted cash within other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

required excess receivables the total value of the securitized receivables must exceed the principal amount owed to the investors by a specified amount the required excess receivables balance represents this specified amount any cash flows generated by the required excess receivables are used if needed to make payments to the investors any remaining cash flows from the required excess receivables are released to us as of february 28 2010 the unpaid principal balance related to the required excess receivables was 1295 million effective march 1 2010 required excess receivables are included in auto loan receivables on our consolidated balance sheets 

 

retained subordinated bonds between january 2008 and april 2009 we retained some or all of the subordinated bonds associated with our term securitizations we received periodic interest payments on certain bonds the bonds were carried at fair value and changes in fair value were included in earnings as a component of caf income we based our valuation on observable market prices of the same or similar instruments when available however observable market prices were not consistently available for these assets therefore our valuations were primarily based on an average of three nonbinding market spread quotes from thirdparty investment banks by applying these average spreads to the bond benchmarks as determined through the use of a widely accepted thirdparty bond pricing model we measured a fair value as of february 28 2010 the fair value of retained subordinated bonds was 2488 million effective march 1 2010 the retained subordinated bonds are eliminated as a part of the consolidation of the term securitization trusts

selected cash flows from securitized receivables 

 

 

proceeds from new securitizations proceeds from new securitizations included proceeds from receivables that were newly securitized in or refinanced through the warehouse facility during the indicated period balances previously outstanding in term securitizations that were refinanced through the warehouse facility totaled 760 million in fiscal 2010 and 1010 million in fiscal 2009 proceeds received when we refinance receivables from the warehouse facility are excluded from this table as they are not considered new securitizations 

 

proceeds from collections proceeds from collections represented principal amounts collected on receivables securitized through the warehouse facility that were used to fund new originations 

 

servicing fees received servicing fees received represented cash fees paid to us to service the securitized receivables 

 

other cash flows received from the retained interest other cash flows received from the retained interest represented cash that we received from the securitized receivables other than servicing fees it included cash collected on interestonly strip and excess receivables amounts released to us from reserve accounts and interest on retained subordinated bonds 

 

 

 

risk management objective of using derivatives we are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions particularly with regard to future issuances of fixedrate debt and existing and future issuances of floatingrate debt primary exposures include libor and other rates used as benchmarks in our term securitizations we enter into derivative instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the future known receipt or payment of uncertain cash amounts the value of which are determined by interest rates our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables 

 

we do not anticipate significant market risk from derivatives as they are predominantly used to match funding costs to the use of the funding however disruptions in the credit 

  

 

  

  

  

markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties 

 

cash flow hedges of interest rate risk our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to better match funding costs to the interest received on the fixedrate receivables being securitized to accomplish these objectives we primarily use interest rate swaps interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our making fixedrate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount these interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments in anticipation of permanent funding in the term securitization market prior to march 1 2010 no derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges 

 

for derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value is initially recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss “aocl” and is subsequently reclassified into caf income in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in caf income 

 

amounts reported in aocl related to derivatives will be reclassified to caf income as interest expense is incurred on our future issuances of fixedrate debt during the next 12 months we estimate that an additional 58 million will be reclassified as a decrease to caf income 

 

during the year ended february 28 2011 we entered into the following interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk 

 

 

as of february 28 2011 we had the following outstanding derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges 

 

 

 

nondesignated hedges derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges including interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are not speculative and are used to better match funding costs to the interest on fixedrate receivables being securitized to minimize the funding costs related to certain term securitization trusts and to limit risk for investors in the warehouse facilities changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are recorded directly in caf income prior to march 1 2010 substantially all of the changes in the fair value of derivatives were offset by the changes in fair value of our retained interest in the related securitized receivables which were also recorded in caf income see note 5 for additional information on retained interest 

 

certain term securitization trusts have entered into derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to mitigate their interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of its assetbacked variable debt effective march 1 2010 the derivative instruments of the term securitization trusts were consolidated on our consolidated balance sheets as part of the adoption of asu nos 200916 and 200917 

 

 

  

  

  

  

during the year ended february 28 2011 we entered into the following interest rate derivatives that were not designated as accounting hedges

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market or if none exists the most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability at the measurement date referred to as the “exit price” the fair value should be based on assumptions that market participants would use including a consideration of nonperformance risk 

 

we assess the inputs used to measure fair value using the threetier hierarchy the hierarchy indicates the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure that fair values are appropriate such controls include model validation review of key model inputs analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and reviews by senior management 

 

valuation methodologies 

money market securities money market securities are cash equivalents which are included in either cash and cash equivalents or other assets and consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less we use quoted market prices for identical assets to measure fair value therefore all money market securities are classified as level 1 

 

retained interest in securitized receivables prior to march 1 2010 the retained interest in securitized receivables included interestonly strip receivables various reserve accounts required excess receivables and retained subordinated bonds excluding the retained subordinated bonds we estimated the fair value of the retained interest using internal valuation models these models included a combination of market inputs and our own assumptions as the valuation models included significant unobservable inputs we classified the retained interest as level 3 

 

for the retained subordinated bonds we based our valuation on observable market prices for similar assets when available otherwise our valuations were based on input from independent third parties and internal valuation models as the key assumption used in the valuation was based on unobservable inputs we classified the retained subordinated bonds as level 3 as described in note 5 there was no retained interest as of february 28 2011 

 

derivative instruments the fair values of our derivative instruments are included in either other current assets or accounts payable as described in note 6 as part of our risk management strategy we utilize derivative instruments to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables interest rate swaps are used to manage our exposure to interest rate movements to better match funding costs to the interest on the fixedrate receivables being securitized and to minimize the funding costs related to certain term securitization trusts interest rate caps are used to limit risk for investors 

  

  

  

  

 

in the warehouse facilities our derivatives are not exchangetraded and are overthecounter customized derivative instruments all of our derivative exposures are with highly rated bank counterparties 

 

we measure derivative fair values assuming that the unit of account is an individual derivative instrument and that derivatives are sold or transferred on a standalone basis we estimate the fair value of our derivatives using quotes determined by the derivative counterparties and thirdparty valuation services we validate certain quotes using our own internal models quotes from thirdparty valuation services quotes received from bank counterparties and our internal models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased expectations for interest rates and the contractual terms of the derivative instruments because model inputs can typically be observed in the liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment these derivatives are classified as level 2 

 

our derivative fair value measurements consider assumptions about counterparty and our own nonperformance risk we monitor counterparty and our own nonperformance risk and in the event that we determine that a party is unlikely to perform under terms of the contract we would adjust the derivative fair value to reflect the nonperformance risk

land held for development represents land owned for potential expansion leased property meeting capital lease criteria is capitalized and the present value of the related lease payments is recorded as longterm debt accumulated amortization on capital lease assets was 114 million as of february 28 2011 and 96 million as of february 28 2010

effective income tax rate reconciliation 

 

 

temporary differences resulting in deferred tax assets and liabilities 

 

 

as discussed in note 2e as of march 1 2010 we adopted fasb asu nos 200916 and 200917 and amended our existing warehouse facility as a result we wroteoff the deferred tax liability applicable to the remaining interestonly strip receivables related to term securitizations previously recorded in retained interest in securitized receivables and we recorded a net deferred tax asset primarily related to the establishment of the allowance for loan losses the combined effect of these adjustments was 549 million 

 

except for amounts for which a valuation allowance has been provided we believe it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets the valuation allowance as of february 28 2011 relates to capital loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized prior to their expiration 

 

reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits 

 

 

as of february 28 2011 we had 187 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits 35 million of which if recognized would affect our effective tax rate it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain of our uncertain tax positions will increase or decrease during the next 12 months however we do not expect the change 

  

  

  

  

  

to have a significant effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows as of february 28 2010 we had 220 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits 17 million of which if recognized would affect our effective tax rate as of february 28 2009 we had 256 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits 26 million of which if recognized would affect our effective tax rate 

 

our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in sga expenses our accrual for interest decreased 26 million to 05 million as of february 28 2011 from 31 million as of february 28 2010 our accrual for interest decreased 21 million to 31 million as of february 28 2010 from 52 million as of february 28 2009 

 

carmax is subject to us federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple states and local jurisdictions with a few insignificant exceptions we are no longer subject to us federal state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to fiscal 2005 

 

 

 

 

we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan the “pension plan” covering the majority of fulltime associates we also have an unfunded nonqualified plan the “restoration plan” that restores retirement benefits for certain associates who are affected by internal revenue code limitations on benefits provided under the pension plan we use a fiscal year end measurement date for both the pension plan and the restoration plan 

 

effective december 31 2008 we froze both the pension plan and the restoration plan no additional benefits have accrued under these plans since that date these changes resulted in the recognition of a noncash net curtailment gain of 74 million in fiscal 2009 in connection with benefits earned prior to the freeze we have a continuing obligation to fund the pension plan and will continue to recognize net periodic pension expense for both plans 

 

benefit plan information 

 

  

  

benefit obligations accumulated and projected benefit obligations “abo” and “pbo” represent the obligations of the benefit plans for past service as of the measurement date abo is the present value of benefits earned to date with benefits computed based on current service and compensation levels pbo is abo increased to reflect expected future service and increased compensation levels as a result of the freeze of plan benefits under our pension and restoration plans as of december 31 2008 the abo and pbo balances are equal to one another at all subsequent dates 

 

assumptions used to determine benefit obligations 

 

 

plan assets  the fair value of plan assets is measured using current market values our pension plan assets are held in trust and management sets the investment policies and strategies longterm strategic investment objectives include asset preservation and appropriately balancing risk and return we oversee the investment allocation process which includes selecting investment managers setting longterm strategic targets and monitoring asset allocations and performance target allocations for plan assets are guidelines not limitations and occasionally plan fiduciaries will approve allocations above or below the targets we target allocating 75 of plan assets to equity and 25 to fixed income securities equity securities are currently composed of mutual funds that include highly diversified investments in large mid and smallcap companies located in the united states and internationally the fixed income securities are currently composed of mutual funds that include investments in debt securities mortgagebacked securities corporate bonds and other debt obligations primarily in the united states we do not expect any plan assets to be returned to us during fiscal 2012

quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level 1 

 

 

 

 

 

 

funding policy for the pension plan we contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements as set forth in the employee benefit and tax laws plus any additional amounts as we may determine to be appropriate we expect to contribute 34 million to the pension plan in fiscal 2012 for the nonfunded restoration plan we contribute an amount equal to the benefit payments 

 

 

  

  

 

 

estimated future benefit payments 

 

 

 

components of net pension expense 

 

 

 

changes not recognized in net pension expense but 

recognized in other comprehensive income 

 

 

in fiscal 2012 we anticipate that 05 million in estimated actuarial losses of the pension plan will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss we do not anticipate that any estimated actuarial losses will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss for the restoration plan 

 

assumptions used to determine net pension expense 

 

 

 

 

 

assumptions underlying both the calculation of the pbo and the net pension expense are actuarial calculations of each plans liability these calculations use participantspecific information such as salary age and years of service as well as certain assumptions the most significant being the discount rate rate of return on plan assets and mortality rate we evaluate these assumptions at least once a year and make changes as necessary 

 

 

 

  

  

 

the discount rate used for retirement benefit plan accounting reflects the yields available on highquality fixed income debt instruments for our plans we review high quality corporate bond indices in addition to a hypothetical portfolio of corporate bonds with maturities that approximate the expected timing of the anticipated benefit payments 

 

to determine the expected longterm return on plan assets we consider the current and anticipated asset allocations as well as historical and estimated returns on various categories of plan assets we apply the estimated rate of return to a marketrelated value of assets which reduces the underlying variability in the asset values the use of expected longterm rates of return on pension plan assets could result in recognized asset returns that are greater or less than the actual returns of those pension plan assets in any given year over time however the expected longterm returns are anticipated to approximate the actual longterm returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees differences between actual and expected returns which are a component of unrecognized actuarial gainslosses are recognized over the average future expected service of the active employees in the pension plan 

 

given the frozen status of the pension and benefit restoration plans the rate of compensation increases is not applicable for periods subsequent to december 31 2008 prior to this date we determined the rate of compensation increases based upon our longterm plans for these increases mortality rate assumptions are based on the life expectancy of the population and were updated as of february 28 2011 to account for increases in life expectancy 

 

 

we sponsor a 401k plan for all associates meeting certain eligibility criteria in conjunction with the retirement benefit plan curtailments enhancements were made to the 401k plan effective january 1 2009 the enhancements increased the maximum salary contribution for eligible associates and increased our matching contribution additionally an annual companyfunded contribution regardless of associate participation was implemented as well as an additional companyfunded contribution to those associates meeting certain age and service requirements the total cost for company contributions was 205 million in fiscal 2011 201 million in fiscal 2010 and 57 million in fiscal 2009 

 

 

effective january 1 2009 we replaced the frozen restoration plan with a new nonqualified retirement plan for certain senior executives who are affected by internal revenue code limitations on benefits provided under the retirement savings 401k plan under this plan these associates may continue to defer portions of their compensation for retirement savings we match the associates’ contributions at the same rate provided under the 401k plan and also provide the annual companyfunded contribution made regardless of associate participation as well as the additional companyfunded contribution to the associates meeting the same age and service requirements this plan is unfunded with lump sum payments to be made upon the associate’s retirement the total cost for this plan was 10 million in fiscal 2011 the total cost for this plan was not material in fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 

 

 

effective january 1 2011 we established an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan to permit certain eligible key associates to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation to a future date this plan also includes a restorative company contribution designed to compensate the plan participants for any loss of company contributions under the retirement savings 401k plan and the retirement restoration plan due to a reduction in their eligible compensation resulting from deferrals into the executive deferred compensation plan the total cost for this plan was not material in fiscal 2011 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

revolving credit facility we have a 700 million revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with bank of america na and various other financial institutions the credit facility is secured by vehicle inventory and contains certain representations and warranties conditions and covenants the financial covenants include a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio borrowings under this credit facility are limited to 80 of qualifying inventory and they are available for working capital and general corporate purposes borrowings accrue interest at variable rates based on libor the federal funds rate or the prime rate depending on the type of borrowing we pay a commitment fee on the used and unused portions of the available funds all outstanding principal amounts will be due and payable in december 2011 and there are no penalties for prepayment 

 

as of february 28 2011 10 million of shortterm debt was outstanding under the credit facility and the remaining capacity was fully available to us 

 

the weighted average interest rate on outstanding shortterm and longterm debt was 16 in fiscal 2011 16 in fiscal 2010 and 35 in fiscal 2009 

 

we capitalize interest in connection with the construction of certain facilities capitalized interest totaled 01 million in fiscal 2011 03 million in fiscal 2010 and 19 million in fiscal 2009 

 

capital leases we have recorded six capital leases for current and future store facilities the related capital lease assets are included in property and equipment these leases were structured at varying interest rates with initial lease terms ranging from 15 to 20 years with payments made monthly the present value of future minimum lease payments totaled 291 million as of february 28 2011 and 281 million as of february 28 2010 

 

nonrecourse notes payable as of march 1 2010 and as discussed in notes 2 and 5 we adopted asu nos 200916 and 200917 and amended our warehouse facility agreement in effect as of that date as a result we consolidated the auto loan receivables previously securitized through that warehouse facility and term securitizations along with the related nonrecourse notes payable and they are now accounted for as secured borrowings the timing of principal payments on the nonrecourse notes payable are based on principal collections net of losses on the securitized auto loan receivables the nonrecourse notes payable accrue interest predominantly at fixed rates and mature between april 2011 and march 2017 but may mature earlier or later depending upon the repayment rate of the underlying auto loan receivables as of february 28 2011 401 billion of nonrecourse notes payable were outstanding the outstanding balance included 1325 million classified as current portion of nonrecourse notes payable as this represents principal payments that have been collected but will be distributed in the following period 

 

as of february 28 2011 the combined warehouse facility limit was 16 billion at that date 943 million of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facilities and unused warehouse capacity totaled 657 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we entered into a second warehouse facility agreement in order to stagger the warehouse facility renewal dates reduce risk and provide greater flexibility during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 we renewed our 800 million warehouse facility that was scheduled to expire in august 2010 for an additional 364day term and we increased the capacity of our second warehouse facility by 400 million as of february 28 2011 800 million of the warehouse facility limit will expire in august 2011 and 800 million will expire in february 2012 the return requirements of investors in the bank conduits could fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions at renewal the cost structure and capacity of the facilities could change these changes could have a significant impact on our funding costs see notes 4 and 5 for additional information on the related securitized auto loan receivables 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

in conjunction with our shareholder rights plan shareholders received preferred stock purchase rights as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of carmax inc common stock owned the rights are exercisable only upon the attainment of or the commencement of a tender offer to attain a 15 or greater ownership interest in the company by a person or group when exercisable and as adjusted for our march 2007 2for1 stock split each right would entitle the holder to buy one half of one onethousandth of a share of cumulative participating preferred stock series a 20 par value at an exercise price of 140 per share subject to adjustment a total of 300000 shares of such preferred stock which has preferential dividend and liquidation rights have been authorized and designated no such shares are outstanding in the event that an acquiring person or group acquires the specified ownership percentage of carmax inc common stock except pursuant to a cash tender offer for all outstanding shares determined to be fair by the board of directors or engages in certain transactions with the company after the rights become exercisable each right will be converted into a right to purchase for half the current market price at that time shares of carmax inc common stock valued at two times the exercise price we also have an additional 19700000 authorized shares of undesignated preferred stock of which no shares are outstanding 

 

 

we maintain longterm incentive plans for management key employees and the nonemployee members of our board of directors the plans allow for the grant of equitybased compensation awards including nonqualified stock options incentive stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock awards stock and cashsettled restricted stock units stock grants or a combination of awards to date we have not awarded any incentive stock options 

 

prior to fiscal 2007 the majority of associates who received sharebased compensation awards primarily received nonqualified stock options from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 these associates primarily received restricted stock instead of stock options and beginning in fiscal 2010 these associates primarily received cashsettled restricted stock units instead of restricted stock awards senior management and other key associates continue to receive awards of nonqualified stock options and starting in fiscal 2010 stocksettled restricted stock units nonemployee directors continue to receive awards of nonqualified stock options and stock grants 

 

nonqualified stock options  nonqualified stock options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed price stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date substantially all of the stock options vest annually in equal amounts over periods of three to four years these options are subject to forfeiture and expire no later than ten years after the date of the grant 

 

restricted stock  restricted stock awards are awards of our common stock that are subject to specified restrictions and a risk of forfeiture the restrictions typically lapse three years from the grant date participants holding restricted stock are entitled to vote on matters submitted to holders of our common stock for a vote 

 

stocksettled restricted stock units  also referred to as market stock units or msus these are awards to eligible key associates that are converted into between zero and two shares of common stock for each unit granted at the end of a threeyear vesting period the conversion ratio is calculated by dividing the average closing price of our stock during the final forty trading days of the threeyear vesting period by our stock price on the grant date with the resulting quotient capped at two this quotient is then multiplied by the number of msus granted to yield the number of shares awarded msus are subject to forfeiture and do not have voting rights 

 

cashsettled restricted stock units  also referred to as restricted stock units or rsus these are awards that entitle the holder to a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock for each unit granted at the end of a threeyear vesting period however the cash payment per rsu will not be greater than 200 or less than 75 of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the grant date rsus are liability awards that are subject to forfeiture and do not have voting rights 

 

as of february 28 2011 a total of 39200000 shares of our common stock have been authorized to be issued under the longterm incentive plans the number of unissued common shares reserved for future grants under the longterm incentive plans was 5815552 as of february 28 2011 

 

 

  

  

 

 

composition of share­based compensation expense 

 

composition of share ­ based compensation expense – by grant type 

 

 

 

we recognize compensation expense for stock options restricted stock and msus on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period of the award the variable expense associated with rsus is recognized over their vesting period net of expected forfeitures and is calculated based on the volumeweighted average price of our common stock on the last trading day of each reporting period the total costs for matching contributions for our employee stock purchase plan are included in sharebased compensation expense there were no capitalized sharebased compensation costs as of the end of fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 

 

stock option activity 

 

 

we granted nonqualified options to purchase 1892867 shares of common stock in fiscal 2011 2948150 shares in fiscal 2010 and 2219857 in fiscal 2009 the total cash received as a result of stock option exercises was 456 million in fiscal 2011 352 million in fiscal 2010 and 102 million in fiscal 2009 we settle stock option exercises with authorized but unissued shares of our common stock the total intrinsic value of options exercised was 416 million for fiscal 2011 258 million for fiscal 2010 and 57 million for fiscal 2009 we realized related tax benefits of 165 million for fiscal 2011 101 million for fiscal 2010 and 22 million for fiscal 2009

for all stock options granted prior to march 1 2006 the fair value was estimated as of the date of grant using a blackscholes optionpricing model for stock options granted to associates on or after march 1 2006 the fair value of each award is estimated as of the date of grant using a binomial valuation model in computing the value of the option the binomial model considers characteristics of fairvalue option pricing that are not available for consideration under the blackscholes model such as the contractual term of the option the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life and the probability of termination or retirement of the option holder for this reason we believe that the binomial model provides a fair value that is more representative of actual experience and future expected experience than the value calculated using the blackscholes model for grants to nonemployee directors prior to fiscal 2009 we used the blackscholes model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards beginning in fiscal 2009 we used the binomial model estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by the recipients of sharebased awards 

 

the weighted average fair values at the date of grant for options granted were 1082 per share in fiscal 2011 530 per share in fiscal 2010 and 716 per share in fiscal 2009 the unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested options totaled 230 million as of february 28 2011 these costs are expected to be recognized on a straightline basis over a weighted average period of 20 years

restricted stock activity 

 

 

we did not grant any shares of restricted stock to our employees in fiscal 2011 or 2010 the fair value of a restricted stock award is determined and fixed based on the fair market value of our stock on the grant date 

 

we realized related tax benefits of 77 million and 41 million from the vesting of restricted stock in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively the realized tax benefits in fiscal 2009 were immaterial the unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested restricted stock awards totaled 06 million as of february 28 2011 these costs are expected to be recognized on a straightline basis over a weighted average period of 01 years 

 

stocksettled restricted stock unit activity 

 

 

for the fiscal years ended february 28 2011 and 2010 we granted msus of 278445 units and 405872 units respectively the weighted average fixed fair values per share at the date of the grant for msus granted in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were 3628 and 1634 respectively the fair values were determined using a montecarlo simulation and were based on the expected market price of our common stock on the vesting date and the expected number of converted common shares the unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested msus totaled 85 million as of february 28 2011 these costs are expected to be recognized on a straightline basis over a weighted average period of 15 years 

 

cashsettled restricted stock unit activity 

 

 

during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we granted rsus of 688880 units and 1005505 units respectively the initial fair market values per share for the liabilityclassified rsus granted during fiscal 2011 and 2010 were 2539 and 1143 respectively the rsus will be cashsettled upon vesting

we sponsor an employee stock purchase plan for all associates meeting certain eligibility criteria associate contributions are limited to 10 of eligible compensation up to a maximum of 7500 per year for each 100 contributed to the plan by associates we match 015 we have authorized up to 8000000 shares of common stock for the employee stock purchase plan shares are acquired through openmarket purchases 

 

as of february 28 2011 a total of 4426064 shares remained available under the plan shares purchased on the open market on behalf of associates totaled 301195 during fiscal 2011 452936 during fiscal 2010 and 677944 during fiscal 2009 the average price per share for purchases under the plan was 2580 in fiscal 2011 1671 in fiscal 2010 and 1222 in fiscal 2009 the total costs for matching contributions are included in sharebased compensation expense 

 

 

 

on march 1 2009 the company adopted the accounting pronouncement related to participating securities with retrospective application which was subsequently integrated into the fasb asc topic 260 “earnings per share” this pronouncement addresses whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are “participating securities” prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing net earnings per share under the twoclass method as described in this pronouncement nonvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and should be included in the computation of net earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method our restricted stock awards are considered participating securities because they contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the twoclass method nonvested msus do not receive nonforfeitable dividend equivalent rights and therefore are not considered participating securities rsus are nonparticipating nonequity instruments and therefore are excluded from net earnings per share calculations the adoption had no impact on previously reported basic or diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2009 

 

basic and dilutive net earnings per share reconciliations 

 

 

certain weightedaverage options to purchase shares of common stock were outstanding and not included in the calculation of diluted net earnings per share because their inclusion 

  

  

  

  

 

would be antidilutive in fiscal 2011 options to purchase 1656658 shares were not included in fiscal 2010 options to purchase 5425666 shares were not included in fiscal 2009 options to purchase 8340996 shares were not included

we conduct a majority of our business in leased premises our lease obligations are based upon contractual minimum rates most leases provide that we pay taxes maintenance insurance and operating expenses applicable to the premises the initial term of most real property leases will expire within the next 20 years however most of the leases have options providing for renewal periods of 5 to 20 years at terms similar to the initial terms for operating leases rent is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term including scheduled rent increases and rent holidays rent expense for all operating leases was 852 million in fiscal 2011 853 million in fiscal 2010 and 821 million in fiscal 2009

on april 2 2008 mr john fowler filed a putative class action lawsuit against carmax auto superstores california llc and carmax auto superstores west coast inc in the superior court of california county of los angeles subsequently two other lawsuits leena areso et al v carmax auto superstores california llc and justin weaver v carmax auto superstores california llc were consolidated as part of the fowler case the allegations in the consolidated case involved 1 failure to provide meal and rest breaks or compensation in lieu thereof 2 failure to pay wages of terminated or resigned employees related to meal and rest breaks and overtime 3 failure to pay overtime 4 failure to comply with itemized employee wage statement provisions and 5 unfair competition the putative class consisted of sales consultants sales managers and other hourly employees who worked for the company in california from april 2 2004 to the present on may 12 2009 the court dismissed all of the class claims with respect to the sales manager putative class on june 16 2009 the court dismissed all claims related to the failure to comply with the itemized employee wage statement provisions the court also granted carmaxs motion for summary adjudication with regard to carmaxs alleged failure to pay overtime to the sales consultant putative class the plaintiffs have appealed the courts ruling regarding the sales consultant overtime claim in addition to the plaintiffs appeal of the overtime claim the claims currently remaining in the lawsuit regarding the sales consultant putative class are 1 failure to provide meal and rest breaks or compensation in lieu thereof 2 failure to pay wages of terminated or resigned employees related to meal and rest breaks and 3 unfair competition on june 16 2009 the court entered a stay of these claims pending the outcome of a california supreme court case involving unrelated third parties but related legal issues the fowler lawsuit seeks compensatory and special damages wages interest civil and statutory penalties restitution injunctive relief and the recovery of attorneys’ fees we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters 

 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business based upon our evaluation of information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect either individually or in the aggregate on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

 

in accordance with the terms of real estate lease agreements we generally agree to indemnify the lessor from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises including environmental liabilities and repairs to leased property upon termination of the lease additionally in accordance with the terms of agreements entered into for the sale of 

  

  

  

  

  

properties we generally agree to indemnify the buyer from certain liabilities and costs arising subsequent to the date of the sale including environmental liabilities and liabilities resulting from the breach of representations or warranties made in accordance with the agreements we do not have any known material environmental commitments contingencies or other indemnification issues arising from these arrangements 

 

as part of our customer service strategy we guarantee the used vehicles we retail with at least a 30day limited warranty a vehicle in need of repair within this period will be repaired free of charge as a result each vehicle sold has an implied liability associated with it accordingly based on historical trends we record a provision for estimated future repairs during the guarantee period for each vehicle sold the liability for this guarantee was 32 million as of february 28 2011 and 26 million as of february 28 2010 and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  




 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to a variety of risks the most significant of which are described below our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks 

 

economic conditions   in the normal course of business we are subject to changes in general or regional us economic conditions including but not limited to consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates interest rates gasoline prices inflation personal discretionary spending levels unemployment levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general any significant deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer demand andor increase costs 

 

capital changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support our geographic expansion and financing of auto loan receivables could adversely affect growth and operating strategies further our current credit facility and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants andor performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants andor performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

we use and have historically relied upon a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf initially we sell these receivables into our warehouse facilities we periodically refinance the receivables through term securitizations changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market have led and could in the future lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or we could be required to seek alternative means to finance our loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse impact on our business sales and results of operations 

 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly 

  

  

  

  

  

impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

 

thirdparty financing providers carmax provides financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty financing providers in the event that one or more of these thirdparty providers could no longer or choose not to provide financing to our customers could only provide financing to a reduced segment of our customers or could no longer provide financing at competitive rates of interest it could have a material impact on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace the current thirdparty providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material impact on our business sales and results of operations 

 

competition   automotive retailing and wholesaling is a highly competitive business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers as well as millions of private individuals competitors buy and sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices further new entrants to the market could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected retail and wholesale sales and margins competition could be affected by the increasing use of the internet to market buy and sell used vehicles and provide vehicle financing the increasing use of the internet in the automotive retail and wholesale business could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations in addition caf and our thirdparty financing providers are subject to competition from various financial institutions 

 

retail prices any significant changes in retail prices for used and new vehicles could reduce sales and profits if any of our competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices for used or new vehicles we would likely reduce our prices in order to remain competitive which could result in a decrease in our sales and results of operations and require a change in our operating strategies 

 

inventory a reduction in the availability of or access to sources of inventory could adversely affect our business a failure to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or a failure to recognize those trends could negatively impact the ability to acquire inventory should we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate the excess inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs would adversely affect our results of operations 

 

regulatory and legislative environment we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as licensing requirements and laws regarding advertising vehicle sales financing and employment practices our facilities and business operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety the violation of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against business operations as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations further private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased their scrutiny of advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced 

 

recent federal legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms may result in an increase in expenses or a decrease in revenues for example the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 as it is phased in over time significantly affects the provision of health care services and may impact the cost of providing our associates with health coverage in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 regulates among other things the provision of consumer financing and may adversely affect our results of operations 

 

growth our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could adversely affect our business and results of operations the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

 

management and workforce our success depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we strive to staff each newly opened store with an experienced management team an inability to build our management bench strength to support store growth could have a material adverse effect on our business our ability to meet our staffing needs while controlling related costs is subject to numerous external and internal factors including unemployment levels prevailing wage rates changes in employment legislation competition for qualified employees in the industry and regions in which we operate and associate relations an inability to retain qualified associates or a significant increase in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business sales and results of operations 

 

 

  

  

 

information systems our business is dependent upon the efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales inventory carmaxcom consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain and continually enhance or protect the integrity of these systems could disrupt our business operations impact sales and results of operations expose us to customer or thirdparty claims or result in adverse publicity 

 

accounting policies and matters we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain materially different amounts could be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions 

 

additionally the financial accounting standards board has proposed various rule changes including but not limited to accounting for leases the sec is also currently considering adopting rules that would require us issuers to prepare their financial statements contained in sec filings in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” as issued by the international accounting standards board the implementation of these or other new accounting requirements or changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition 

 

confidential customer information   in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty service providers could be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information whether by us or by thirdparty service providers could damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our business or otherwise affect our results of operations 

 

litigation we are subject to various litigation matters which could adversely affect our business claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

 

automotive manufacturers adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could impact our results of operations manufacturer recalls could also have an adverse effect on used vehicle sales or valuations and could impact our results of operations 

 

weather the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes or other natural disasters could cause store closures adversely affecting consumer traffic and could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

seasonal fluctuations our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

 

geographic concentration our performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large number of our superstores are located in the southeastern us and in the chicago los angeles and washington dcbaltimore markets our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experienced a downturn in economic conditions it could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

 

other material events the occurrence of certain material events including acts of terrorism the outbreak of war or other significant national or international events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

none 

 




 item 2 properties 

 

we conduct our used vehicle operations in two basic retail formats – production and nonproduction superstores production superstores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction superstore on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market as a result some superstores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction superstores until we expand our presence in that market as of february 28 2011 we operated 61 production superstores and 42 nonproduction superstores at that date we also operated one new car store which was located adjacent to our used car superstore in laurel maryland our remaining four new car franchises are operated as part of our used car superstores 

 

production superstores are generally 40000 to 60000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres but a few range from approximately 70000 to 95000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres nonproduction superstores are generally 10000 to 25000 square feet on 4 to 12 acres 

 

used car superstores as of february 28 2011 

 

 

we have financed the majority of our stores through saleleaseback transactions as of february 28 2011 we leased 57 of our 103 used car superstores as well as our caf office building in atlanta georgia we owned the remaining 46 stores currently in operation we also owned our home office building in richmond virginia and land associated with planned future store openings 

 

  

  

expansion 

since opening our first used car superstore in 1993 we have grown organically through the construction and opening of companyoperated stores we do not franchise our operations as of february 28 2011 we operated 103 used car superstores in 49 us markets which represented approximately 48 of the us population we believe that further geographic expansion and additional fillin opportunities in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth 

 

in december 2008 as a result of the weak economic and sales environment we temporarily suspended store growth we resumed growth in fiscal 2011 opening three superstores that had been constructed in fiscal 2009 but which we chose not to open until market conditions improved we expect to open five superstores in fiscal 2012 and between eight and ten superstores in fiscal 2013

business overview 

 

general 

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we pioneered the used car superstore concept opening our first store in 1993 our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems as of february 28 2011 we operated 103 used car superstores in 49 markets comprised of 37 midsized markets 11 large markets and 1 small market we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000 and 25 million people we also operated five new car franchises in fiscal 2011 we sold 396181 used cars representing 98 of the total 404412 vehicles we sold at retail 

 

we believe the carmax consumer offer is distinctive within the auto retailing marketplace our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other big box retailers our consumer offer is structured around our four customer benefits low nohaggle prices a broad selection high quality vehicles and a customerfriendly sales process our website carmaxcom is a valuable tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer a sophisticated search engine and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct their shopping online we generate revenues income and cash flows primarily by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing extended service plans “esp” a guaranteed asset protection “gap” product and vehicle repair service gap is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft 

 

we also generate revenues income and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards these vehicles are sold through onsite wholesale auctions wholesale auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis and as of february 28 2011 we conducted auctions at 51 used car superstores during fiscal 2011 we sold 263061 wholesale vehicles on average the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers 

 

carmax provides financing to qualified retail customers through caf our finance operation and our arrangements with several industryleading financial institutions as of february 28 2011 these third parties included capital one auto finance santander consumer usa and wells fargo dealer services the thirdparty providers who purchase subprime financings generally purchase these loans at a discount and we collect fixed prenegotiated fees per vehicle financed from the majority of the other providers we have tested and will continue to test other thirdparty financing providers we have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers 

 

we offer financing through caf to qualified customers purchasing vehicles at carmax caf utilizes proprietary customized scoring models based upon the credit history of the customer along with caf’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment we offer customers an array of competitive rates and terms allowing them to choose the one that best fits their needs we randomly test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and 3day payoffs to assess market competitiveness after the effect of estimated 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed approximately 30 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2011 as of february 28 2011 caf serviced more than 380000 customers in its 433 billion portfolio 

 

 

  

  

 

we sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors as of february 28 2011 the used vehicle thirdparty esp providers were cna national warranty corporation and the warranty group and the thirdparty gap provider was safeguard products international llc we have no contractual liability to the customer under these thirdparty plans esp revenue represents commissions received on the sale of esps and gap from the unrelated third parties 

 

over the long term we believe the primary drivers for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and stores included in our comparable store base as well as improvements in margins resulting from operational efficiencies we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price 

 

as a result of the weak economic and sales environment in december 2008 we temporarily suspended store growth this suspension reduced our capital needs and growthrelated costs based on improvements in our sales and profitability in fiscal 2010 as well as increased stability in the credit markets we resumed store growth in fiscal 2011 opening three superstores we plan to open five superstores in fiscal 2012 and between eight and ten superstores in fiscal 2013 we are in the process of the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 28 2011 we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 48 of the us population 

 

the principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to build our management bench strength to support our store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at favorable terms we strive to staff each newly opened store with an experienced management team therefore we must recruit train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

 

financing and securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving securitization program comprised of two warehouse facilities “warehouse facilities” to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf until they can be funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement as of march 1 2010 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” nos 200916 and 200917 on a prospective basis pursuant to these pronouncements we now recognize all transfers of auto loan receivables into either our warehouse facilities or term securitizations as secured borrowings which results in recording the auto loan receivables and the related nonrecourse notes payable on our consolidated balance sheets also pursuant to these pronouncements beginning in fiscal 2011 caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings no longer includes a gain on the sale of loans through securitization transactions but instead primarily reflects the interest and fee income associated with the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the nonrecourse notes payable issued to fund these receivables direct caf expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses 

 

auto loan receivables include amounts due from customers primarily related to used retail vehicle sales financed through caf and are presented net of an allowance for estimated loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in the portfolio as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the underlying economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance 

 

see notes 2e 2h 4 and 5 for additional information on auto loan receivables and securitizations 

 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer we recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered net of a reserve for returns under our 5day moneyback guarantee a reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle because we are not the primary obligor under these plans we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale net of a reserve for returns the reserve for cancellations is recorded based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future cancellations differ from historical averages 

 

 

  

  

 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted see note 9 for additional information on income taxes 

 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider available carrybacks future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 28 2011 will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would be affected in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 the 16 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2011 resulted from an 11 increase in unit sales and a 5 increase in average retail selling price the 11 unit sales growth reflected a 10 increase in comparable store used unit sales combined with sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base the increase in comparable store unit sales primarily reflected the benefit of the continuing gradual rebound in customer traffic as well as an increase in the sales conversion rate we believe the sales conversion rate benefited from increased customer access to credit 

 

the increase in the average retail selling price primarily reflected increases in our vehicle acquisition costs resulting from appreciation in wholesale industry used vehicle values used vehicle valuations remained strong during fiscal 2011 as the overall supply of used vehicles being remarketed continued to be somewhat constrained compared with prerecession periods declines in new vehicle sales and related used vehicle tradeins vehicle leasing activity and fleet sales contributed to a reduction in the supply of used vehicles being remarketed 

 

our data indicated that we increased our share of the latemodel used vehicle market by approximately 7 in fiscal 2011 we believe our ability to grow market share year after year is a testament to the strength of our consumer offer the skill of our associates and the preference for our brand 

 

 

  

  

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 the 9 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2010 resulted from a 5 increase in average retail selling price and a 3 increase in unit sales the increase in the average retail selling price primarily reflected the effect of higher used vehicle wholesale valuations on our vehicle acquisition costs after falling sharply in fiscal 2009 wholesale vehicle values climbed during much of fiscal 2010 which we believe in part reflected tight supply conditions that occurred as vehicle tradein activity slowed in tandem with the decline in new car industry sales 

 

the 3 unit sales growth reflected a 1 increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base we experienced a significant improvement in sales execution in fiscal 2010 however the resulting increase in sales conversion rate was almost fully offset by a decline in customer traffic the improvement in sales conversion occurred despite the tightening of lending standards by our thirdparty financing providers and caf in fiscal 2010 which we estimate adversely affected our comparable store used unit sales growth by several percentage points continuing weak economic conditions caused our customer traffic to remain below the prior year level despite the fact that the government’s consumer assistance to recycle and save act “cars” or “cash for clunkers” new car incentive program generated a spike in traffic in late july and august 2009 similar to our experience with previous successful broadbased new car incentive programs we believe this program had a beneficial effect on our used car customer traffic and sales 

 

our data indicated that we increased our share of the latemodel used vehicle market by more than 10 in fiscal 2010 while the overall market contracted 

 

new vehicle sales 

as of february 28 2011 we had a total of five new car franchises representing the chrysler nissan and toyota brands in june 2009 we were notified by general motors that our chevrolet franchise in kenosha wisconsin would be terminated during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we stopped selling new general motors vehicles at this site where we also have a used car superstore and a toyota franchise this franchise termination did not have a material effect on sales or earnings 

 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 new vehicle revenues increased 6 in fiscal 2011 due to a 5 rise in unit sales and a 2 increase in average retail selling price the growth in our unit sales was achieved against a backdrop of improving new vehicle industry sales based on industry data new light vehicle industry sales increased 13 to 119 million units from 105 million units in fiscal 2010 although they remained significantly below the 16 million to 17 million unit range routinely achieved between 2000 and 2007 the wind down of our chevrolet franchise which was one of many franchises terminated by general motors partially offset the growth in our new vehicle unit sales 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 new vehicle revenues declined 29 in fiscal 2010 the decrease was entirely the result of a corresponding decline in unit sales which primarily reflected the extremely soft new car industry sales trends for the brands we represent based on industry data new light vehicle industry sales declined 15 to 105 million units from 123 million units in fiscal 2009 a reduction in sales volumes at our chevrolet franchise following general motors’ termination announcement also contributed to the decline in new vehicle unit sales while new vehicle sales volumes in the second quarter of fiscal 2010 benefitted from the cash for clunkers program we believe the effect on the full year was less material as this program primarily shifted new vehicle demand into the second fiscal quarter from the first and third quarters 

wholesale vehicle sales 

our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering highquality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they can also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles wholesaled 

 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 the 54 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2011 resulted from a 33 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 16 increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price the growth in unit sales reflected strong increases in both appraisal traffic and our appraisal buy rate our appraisal traffic benefited from the increase in customer traffic in our stores and from the lift in new car industry sales and related used vehicle tradein activity in fiscal 2011 we believe the strong wholesale pricing environment and the resulting increases in our appraisal offers had a favorable effect on the appraisal buy rate 

 

 

  

  

 

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 the 8 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2010 resulted from a 6 increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price combined with a 2 increase in wholesale unit sales the increase in wholesale unit sales was mainly the result of a significant increase in our appraisal buy rate we believe the strong industrywide wholesale vehicle pricing environment and the resulting increases in our appraisal offers had a favorable effect on the appraisal buy rate the benefit of the improvement in appraisal buy rate was largely offset however by a doubledigit decline in appraisal traffic particularly in the first half of the year appraisal traffic was adversely affected by both the slowdown in our customer traffic and by the reduction in new car industry sales and the related used vehicle tradein activity in fiscal 2010 

 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of esps and gap reported in esp revenues service department sales and net thirdparty finance fees the fixed fees paid to us per vehicle financed by the majority of our thirdparty financing providers vary by provider reflecting their differing levels of credit risk exposure the thirdparty providers who purchase subprime financings generally purchase these loans at a discount which is reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received on other thirdparty financings 

 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 other sales and revenues increased 8 in fiscal 2011 primarily fueled by an increase in esp revenues esp revenues climbed 20 reflecting the 11 growth in used unit sales and an increase in esp penetration due in part to refinements in the plan design implemented in fiscal 2011 esp revenues also benefited from a slowdown in the rate of esp cancellations and from having a full year of gap revenues in fiscal 2011 following the roll out of this product in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 service department sales were similar to the prior year as service resources were used primarily in reconditioning vehicles to support the retail unit sales growth net thirdparty finance fees declined as a result of a mix shift among providers the total percent of sales financed by the third parties increased in fiscal 2011 due in part to current arrangements with these providers to purchase a portion of the loans that previously would have been originated by caf the increase in thirdparty penetration was more than offset however by the effect of an increase in the percentage of sales financed by our subprime financing providers the subprime providers financed approximately 8 of retail unit sales in fiscal 2011 compared with approximately 6 in fiscal 2010 

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 other sales and revenues increased 2 in fiscal 2010 the increase was comprised of a 15 increase in esp revenues largely offset by a 94 decline in net thirdparty finance fees esp revenues benefited from the 3 increase in used unit sales and the successful introduction of gap in fiscal 2010 in addition fiscal 2010 esp revenues benefited from modifications in pricing made during the second half of fiscal 2009 the decline in net thirdparty finance fees primarily reflected a mix shift among providers which increased the percentage of vehicle sales financed by the subprime provider the subprime provider financed approximately 6 of retail unit sales in fiscal 2010 compared with approximately 3 in fiscal 2009 in addition during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we curtailed our temporary strategy of routing a larger percentage of credit applications directly to the thirdparty financing providers we had originally implemented this practice in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 in order to slow the use of capacity in our warehouse facility during a period when the assetbacked securitization markets were severely disrupted the warehouse facility is used to provide initial funding for substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf 

 

gross profit 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

gross profit per unit 

 

 

 

 

 

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit we employ a volumebased strategy and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement when customer traffic and sales are consistently strong we generally take fewer pricing markdowns which in turn benefits gross profit dollars per unit when the sales pace slows we may initially take more pricing markdowns which could pressure gross profit dollars per unit however as we are successful in reducing inventories to align them with a slower sales pace this may allow us to return to target levels of gross profit per unit over the past several years we have continued to refine our carbuying strategies which we believe has benefited used vehicle gross profit per unit 

 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 our used vehicle gross profit increased 1142 million or 15 to 8540 million from 7399 million in fiscal 2010 reflecting the combination of the 11 increase in used unit sales and a 4 improvement in gross profit per unit used vehicle gross profit per unit increased 84 to 2156 per unit compared with 2072 per unit in fiscal 2010 

 

the improvement in gross profit per unit resulted from a combination of factors including benefits realized from our ongoing initiatives to improve vehicle reconditioning efficiency and reduce waste the support provided by the strong wholesale pricing environment and a modest increase in the percentage of retail vehicles sourced directly from consumers through our appraisal process vehicles purchased directly from consumers typically generate more gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased at auction as of the end of fiscal 2011 we estimated our efforts to eliminate waste from our reconditioning processes in recent years have allowed us to achieve a sustainable reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately 250 per vehicle on a cumulative basis this reduction was primarily accomplished through our emphasis on the consistent application of our reconditioning standards across our entire store base 

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 our used vehicle gross profit increased 954 million or 15 to 7399 million from 6444 million in fiscal 2009 reflecting the combination of an 11 improvement in used vehicle gross profit per unit and the 3 increase in used unit sales used vehicle gross profit per unit increased 207 to 2072 per unit compared with 1865 per unit in fiscal 2009 

 

the improvement in gross profit per unit resulted from a combination of factors including our initiative to reduce waste in the vehicle reconditioning process as of the end of fiscal 2010 we estimated that we achieved a sustainable reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately 200 per vehicle on a cumulative basis the benefit of the yearoveryear appreciation in used vehicle wholesale values also contributed to our used vehicle gross profit in addition we believe continuing refinements to our proprietary inventory management systems and processes were contributing factors as we were able to increase inventory turns in fiscal 2010 despite our aggressive reductions in inventory in the previous year the improvement also reflected the belowaverage profitability reported early in fiscal 2009 when the initial slowdown in customer traffic and a rapid decline in underlying values of suvs and trucks put pressure on our used vehicle margins 

 

 

 

  

  

 

new vehicle gross profit 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 our new vehicle gross profit declined 20 to 54 million from 67 million in fiscal 2010 the reduction occurred as the benefit of the 5 increase in new vehicle unit sales was more than offset by a 199 reduction in gross profit per unit to 659 per unit from 858 per unit in fiscal 2010 

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 our new vehicle gross profit decreased 25 to 67 million from 90 million in fiscal 2009 the reduction primarily reflected the 29 decline in new vehicle unit sales partially offset by a 5 increase in new vehicle gross profit per unit which improved to 858 per unit from 814 per unit in fiscal 2009 the industrywide reductions in new vehicle inventories and incentives related to the cash for clunkers program benefited the new vehicle gross profit dollars per unit in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010 

 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale vehicle gross profit has steadily increased over the last several years reflecting in part the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our carbuying strategies appraisal delivery processes and instore auction processes we have made continuous improvements in these processes which we believe have allowed us to become more efficient our instore auctions have benefited from initiatives to increase our dealertocar ratio which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices in addition the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles 

 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 673 million or 39 to 2388 million from 1715 million in fiscal 2010 the improvement reflected the 33 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 4 rise in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit increased 39 to 908 per unit from 869 per unit in fiscal 2010 the strength of our wholesale gross profit per unit reflected the strong demand for older higher mileage vehicles which are the mainstay of our auctions as well as the continued strong dealer attendance and resulting high dealertocar ratios at our auctions 

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 89 million or 5 to 1715 million from 1625 million in fiscal 2009 reflecting the combination of a 4 improvement in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit and the 2 increase in wholesale unit sales wholesale gross profit per unit increased 32 to 869 per unit compared with 837 per unit in fiscal 2009 the improvement in the wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit primarily reflected the higher yearoveryear wholesale pricing environment we also achieved a new record dealertocar ratio at our auctions in fiscal 2010 with the resulting price competition among bidders contributing to the strong wholesale gross profit per unit 

 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to esp and gap revenues net thirdparty finance fees and service department sales we have no cost of sales related to esp and gap revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent commissions paid to us by certain thirdparty providers net of the discount associated with the loans purchased by subprime providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition of other gross profit 

 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 other gross profit increased 221 million or 12 to 2030 million from 1808 million in fiscal 2010 other gross profit per unit improved modestly to 502 per unit from 495 per unit in fiscal 2010 esp and gap gross profit increased 293 million or 20 benefiting from the 11 increase in used unit sales the improved esp penetration rate and the prior year roll out of the gap product service department gross profit grew 29 million or 8 the increases in esp and gap and service department gross profits were partially offset by a 101 million reduction in net thirdparty finance fees which were adversely affected by the mix shift among providers 

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 other gross profit increased 286 million or 19 to 1808 million from 1522 million in fiscal 2009 other gross profit per unit increased 68 or 16 to 495 per unit from 427 per unit in fiscal 2009 esp gross profit increased 193 million or 15 benefiting from the introduction of gap the modifications in pricing made during the second half of fiscal 2009 and the 3 increase in used unit sales service department gross profit grew 236 million primarily because our retail vehicle sale growth outpaced fixed service overhead costs the increases in esp and service department gross profit were partially offset by a 143 million reduction in net thirdparty finance fees which were adversely affected by the mix shift among providers and the termination of our temporary practice of reducing caf originations by routing more credit applications to our thirdparty providers 

 

 

  

  

 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not been a significant contributor to results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than on average retail prices however increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit the sga ratio and caf income to the extent the average amount financed also increases 

 

during fiscal 2011 and 2010 we experienced a period of appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing we believe the appreciation resulted in part from a reduced supply of used vehicles in the market that was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle tradein activity in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 the appreciation also reflected a rebound in pricing compared with the severe depreciation experienced in fiscal 2009 the higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our average selling prices for used and wholesale vehicles 

 

during fiscal 2009 the weakness in the economy and the stresses on consumer spending contributed to the industrywide slowdown in the sale of new and used vehicles and to the unprecedented decline in wholesale market prices for most vehicle classes during the first three quarters of the year a sharp increase in gasoline prices particularly pressured wholesale valuations for suvs and trucks these lower wholesale values reduced our vehicle acquisition costs and contributed to the decline in our used and wholesale vehicle average selling price 

 

carmax auto finance income 

caf provides financing for a portion of our used and new car retail sales because the purchase of a vehicle is generally reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers while financing can also be obtained from thirdparty sources we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk furthermore we believe that our processes and systems the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans both for caf and for the thirdparty financing providers generally caf has provided us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on thirdparty financing sources we also believe caf enables us to capture additional sales 

 

caf provides financing for qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest the majority of caf income has typically been generated by the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and the related cost of funds substantially all of the loans originated by caf are sold in securitization transactions 

 

as described in the critical accounting policies section of this mda as of march 1 2010 we adopted asu nos 200916 and 200917 on a prospective basis beginning in fiscal 2011 caf income no longer includes a gain on the sale of loans through securitization transactions but instead primarily reflects the interest and fee income associated with owning and servicing the auto loan receivables less the interest expense associated with the nonrecourse notes payable issued to fund these receivables direct caf expenses and a provision for estimated loan losses 

 

 

 

  

  

 

components of caf income 

 

 

caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs or income we present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefits or costs that could be attributed to caf examples of indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources administrative services marketing information systems accounting legal treasury and executive payroll 

 

fiscal 2011 caf reported income of 2200 million in fiscal 2011 largely driven by the spread between interest and fee income charged to consumers and our funding costs caf income also reflected favorability in our provision for loan losses resulting from betterthanexpected loss experience 

 

net interest income 

 

 

 

 

net interest income before the provision for loan losses which reflects the spread between the interest charged to consumers and our funding costs was 67 of total average managed receivables principal only in fiscal 2011 this spread was favorably affected by the following factors 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

additionally as noted below the fiscal 2011 provision for loan losses benefited from lowerthananticipated net chargeoffs and favorable adjustments to the allowance for loan losses 

 

servicing fee income and interest income on retained interest in securitized receivables were related to receivables securitized through the warehouse facility prior to march 1 2010 other gains primarily reflected favorable derivative valuations 

 

allowance for loan losses 

 

 

 

 

percent columns indicate 

 

 

 

 

the allowance for loan losses represents an estimate of the amount of net losses inherent in the portfolio as of the applicable reporting date and anticipated to occur during the following 12 months the allowance is primarily based on the credit quality of the underlying receivables historical loss trends and forecasted forward loss curves we also take into account recent trends in delinquencies and losses recovery rates and the underlying economic environment the provision for loan losses is the periodic cost of maintaining an adequate allowance 

 

the decrease in the allowance from 586 million or 14 of ending managed receivables as of march 1 2010 to 389 million or 09 of ending managed receivables as of february 28 2011 reflected favorable trends in net chargeoffs the record high recovery rate relative to historical norms and the credit profile of new loan originations which benefited from caf’s tightening of lending standards beginning in fiscal 2010 in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 net chargeoffs were significantly lower than our original projections as a result we reduced our estimate of future loan losses on our existing portfolio of managed receivables the favorability in net chargeoffs and the resulting adjustment to the allowance for loan losses positively affected fiscal 2011 net income by approximately 003 per share versus our expectations 

 

 

 

  

  

  

  

past due account information 

 

 

credit loss information 

 

 

in fiscal 2011 we experienced improvements in both past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables and net credit losses as a percentage of total average managed receivables principal only we believe the improvements were the result of several factors including our credit tightening implemented in fiscal 2010 the strong recovery rates and general industry trends for losses and delinquencies 

 

the average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction historically the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42 to a high of 55 and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment 

 

caf supplemental origination information 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

fiscal 2010 and prior years  prior to march 1 2010 securitization transactions were accounted for as sales a gain recorded at the time of securitization resulted from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables the gain on sales of loans originated and sold included both the gain income recorded at the time of securitization and the effect of any subsequent changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs that were incurred in the same fiscal period that the loans were originated other gains or losses included the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous fiscal periods in addition other gains or losses included the effects of new term securitizations changes in the valuation of retained subordinated bonds and the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing term securitizations as applicable other income consisted of servicing fee income on securitized receivables and interest income interest income included the effective yield on the retained interest as well as interest income earned on the retained subordinated bonds 

 

between january 2008 and april 2009 we retained some or all of the subordinated bonds associated with our term securitizations we retained these subordinated bonds because at the applicable issue date the economics of doing so were more favorable than selling them retained subordinated bonds were included in retained interest in securitized receivables on 

  

  

  

  

 

our consolidated balance sheets and their total fair value was 2488 million as of february 28 2010 and 874 million as of february 28 2009 changes in the fair value of the retained subordinated bonds were reflected in caf income 

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 caf income increased to 1752 million from 153 million in fiscal 2009 in both periods caf results were affected by adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal years in fiscal 2010 the adjustments increased caf income by 267 million or 007 per share while in fiscal 2009 the adjustments reduced caf income by 818 million or 023 per share 

 

the fiscal 2010 adjustments included 640 million of favorable marktomarket adjustments primarily on retained subordinated bonds and 189 million of net favorable valuation adjustments partially offset by a 562 million increase in funding costs related to auto loans originated in prior fiscal years the fiscal 2009 adjustments included 320 million of unfavorable marktomarket adjustments on retained subordinated bonds 318 million of net unfavorable valuation adjustments and an 180 million increase in funding costs related to auto loans originated in prior fiscal years 

 

excluding these adjustments from both periods caf income increased to 1486 million from 970 million in fiscal 2009 caf’s gain on loans originated and sold climbed to 830 million from 465 million in fiscal 2009 several factors contributed to this improvement the spread between the rates charged customers and caf’s funding costs increased largely due to lower benchmark rates in addition caf’s tightening of lending standards had a favorable effect on the expected net loss and discount rate assumptions used to value the related gain income and on the required credit enhancements the volume of caf loans originated declined 4 to 184 billion from 191 billion in fiscal 2009 mainly reflecting a decline in the percentage of sales financed by caf caf’s penetration rate fell to 30 from 33 in fiscal 2009 primarily reflecting caf’s tightening of lending standards 

 

the increases in servicing fee income and direct caf expenses in fiscal 2010 were proportionate to the growth in average managed receivables principal only the interest income component of other caf income which increased to 17 of average managed receivables principal only from 12 in fiscal 2009 included the interest earned on the retained subordinated bonds this growth in interest income primarily resulted from our increased holdings of retained subordinated bonds and higher yields on subordinated bonds retained in connection with the april 2009 securitization 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses primarily include payroll expenses other than payroll related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service which is included in cost of sales fringe benefits rent and occupancy costs advertising and other general expenses 

 

fiscal 2011 versus fiscal 2010 sga expenses increased 11 to 9051 million from 8187 million in fiscal 2010 the increase in sga primarily reflected increases in sales commissions and other variable costs associated with the growth in unit sales and higher advertising costs as well as costs associated with our resumption of store growth the increase also reflected the absence of a favorable litigation settlement included in sga in the prior year which increased fiscal 2010 net earnings by 002 per share the sga ratio improved to 101 from 110 in fiscal 2010 reflecting the leverage associated with the increases in retail and wholesale unit sales and average selling prices 

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 sga expenses were reduced 7 to 8187 million from 8824 million in fiscal 2009 despite the increase in unit sales in fiscal 2010 given the weak environment experienced in the previous two years we felt it was prudent to take a particularly cautious approach to sga spending during fiscal 2010 accordingly we made significant curtailments in advertising implemented a wage freeze for all salaried and hourly associates and a hiring freeze at our home office reduced our management bench strength and deferred developmental and discretionary project spending the sga expense reduction also reflected decreases in growthrelated costs including preopening and relocation costs resulting from the suspension of store growth as well as benefits from a variety of wastereduction initiatives the sga ratio fell to 110 from 127 in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the reduction in sga expenses and the leverage associated with the increases in average selling prices and unit sales 

 

the fiscal 2010 sga expenses included the benefit of a favorable litigation settlement which increased net earnings by 002 per share while the fiscal 2009 sga expenses included various nonrecurring items which in the aggregate reduced net earnings by a total of 004 per share 

 

 

 

  

  

 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 379 in fiscal 2011 378 in fiscal 2010 and 388 in fiscal 2009 the fiscal 2011 effective tax rate benefited from favorable adjustments relating to prior years’ tax items the fiscal 2010 effective tax rate was slightly reduced by the favorable settlement of prior year tax audits 

 

fiscal 2012 planned superstore openings 

 

 

 

we estimate capital expenditures will total approximately 2250 million in fiscal 2012 compared with the 766 million of capital spending in fiscal 2011 the increase in planned fiscal 2012 expenditures primarily reflects real estate acquisitions and construction costs associated with store growth we incurred no material construction costs in fiscal 2011 related to the three stores opened in that year these stores were built in fiscal 2009 but we chose not to open them until economic conditions improved we expect fiscal 2012 capital spending will include some costs for stores planned to be opened in the first half of fiscal 2013 we expect to open between eight and ten stores in fiscal 2013

financial condition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

the combined effects of the adoption of asu nos 200916 and 200917 and the march 1 2010 amendment to our then existing warehouse facility agreement represent noncash transactions and thus the reported cash flow information for fiscal 2011 takes into account the effect of these and other related reclassifications and adjustments see note 2e for additional information on the effects of the accounting change 

 

operating activities in fiscal 2011 net cash used in operating activities totaled 172 million while in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 net cash provided by operating activities totaled 503 million and 2646 million respectively in fiscal 2011 a 3047 million increase in auto loan receivables more than offset the net cash generated by all other operating activities resulting in the net use of cash as discussed in note 2e auto loan receivables and the related cash flows were not reported in the consolidated financial statements prior to fiscal 2011 the increase in auto loan receivables primarily reflected the amount by which caf net loan originations exceeded loan repayments during the year caf auto loan receivables are funded through securitization transactions as a result the majority of the increases in auto loan receivables are accompanied by increases in nonrecourse notes payable which are reflected as cash provided by financing activities and not included in cash provided by operations 

 

compared with the prior year the 2143 million decline in cash from operating activities in fiscal 2010 occurred despite the significant increase in net income it primarily reflected the use of cash for increases in the retained interest in securitized receivables and inventory in fiscal 2010 while the prior year benefited from the generation of cash from a significant reduction in inventory 

 

after taking into account the effect of the change in accounting for securitized receivables the 437 million of retained interest as of the end of fiscal 2010 was related to amounts securitized in the warehouse facility as of february 28 2010 and this amount was either reclassified or eliminated during the first quarter of fiscal 2011 in conjunction with resecuritization activity the 2041 million increase in the retained interest in fiscal 2010 primarily resulted from retaining subordinated bonds in an april 2009 term securitization and favorable marktomarket adjustments recognized during that fiscal year 

 

 

 

  

  

 

inventory totaled 105 billion as of the end of fiscal 2011 8431 million as of the end of fiscal 2010 and 7032 million as of the end of fiscal 2009 the 24 increase in inventory during fiscal 2011 was attributable to the combination of an 18 increase in used vehicle units in inventory and the rise in vehicle acquisition costs resulting from changes in wholesale vehicle valuations the increase in units reflected the additional vehicles required to support recent sales trends as well as the effect of the three stores opened during fiscal 2011 the 20 increase in inventory during fiscal 2010 was attributable to the increase in our vehicle acquisition costs caused by appreciation in wholesale vehicle values combined with a 10 increase in used vehicle units in inventory the increase in units reflected the additional vehicles required to support sales trends in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 the increases in used vehicle units in inventory in fiscal 2010 and 2011 also reflected a gradual return to more normalized levels of saleable inventory per store following dramatic reductions made in fiscal 2009 in response to falling customer demand and sales levels during that year 

 

we utilize derivative instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts the values of which are determined by interest rates prior to march 1 2010 no derivative instruments were designated as accounting hedges as we believed this treatment was best aligned with our use of gainonsale accounting in conjunction with the adoption of the new accounting for securitized receivables as of the beginning of fiscal 2011 we have begun to designate certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk as we believe this treatment is better aligned with our current accounting policies 

 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 722 million in fiscal 2011 213 million in fiscal 2010 and 1553 million in fiscal 2009 investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures which totaled 766 million in fiscal 2011 224 million in fiscal 2010 and 1857 million in fiscal 2009 during this threeyear period annual capital spending was lower than in the immediately preceding years reflecting our decision in december 2008 to temporarily suspend store growth in fiscal 2011 capital spending primarily included construction costs related to stores planned to be opened in fiscal 2012 and real estate acquisitions for future store openings no material construction costs were incurred in fiscal 2011 related to the three stores opened that year as these stores were built in fiscal 2009 but we chose not to open them until economic conditions improved in fiscal 2010 capital spending primarily represented expenditures required to maintain our existing structures that were capital in nature which were fairly modest because of the relatively young average age of our store base during fiscal 2009 we opened 11 used car superstores and we completed construction of 3 additional stores that were subsequently opened in fiscal 2011 

 

historically capital expenditures have been funded with internallygenerated funds debt and saleleaseback transactions net proceeds from the sale of assets totaled 07 million in fiscal 2010 and 343 million in fiscal 2009 during fiscal 2009 we completed saleleaseback transactions for our two used car superstores in austin texas 

 

as of february 28 2011 we owned 46 of our 103 used car superstores and our home office in richmond virginia in addition five existing superstores and one future superstore site were accounted for as capital leases 

 

financing activities during fiscal 2011 net cash provided by financing activities totaled 1123 million including a 1873 million net increase in total nonrecourse notes payable partially offset by a 1222 million net reduction in borrowings under the revolving credit facility and capital leases the increase in nonrecourse notes payable resulted from the increase in securitized auto loan receivables during fiscal 2010 net cash used in financing activities totaled 1513 million including a 1865 million reduction in borrowings under the revolving credit facility and capital leases during fiscal 2009 net cash provided by financing activities totaled 184 million including a 78 million increase in borrowings under the revolving credit facility and capital leases 

 

in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the reductions in borrowings under the revolving credit facility reflected the use of excess cash to pay down debt as well as our relatively low levels of capital spending resulting from our temporary suspension of store growth in fiscal 2009 total debt increased only modestly as our significant reductions in inventory substantially offset the effects of the decline in net earnings and our increase in cash 

 

 

  

  

 

total debt and cash and cash equivalents 

 

 

we have a 700 million revolving credit facility which expires in december 2011 the credit facility is secured by vehicle inventory and contains customary representations and warranties conditions and covenants as of february 28 2011 we were in compliance with the financial covenants borrowings under this credit facility are limited to 80 of qualifying inventory and they are available for working capital and general corporate purposes as of february 28 2011 10 million of shortterm debt was outstanding under the credit facility and the remaining capacity was fully available to us during fiscal 2011 excess cash flows were used to pay down this facility and to build a modest cash balance 

 

caf auto loan receivables are primarily funded through securitization transactions our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the auto loan receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization vehicles even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings similarly the investors in the nonrecourse notes payable have no recourse to our assets beyond the securitized receivables the amounts on deposit in reserve accounts and the restricted cash from collections on auto loan receivables we do however continue to have the rights associated with the interest we retain in these securitization vehicles 

 

as of february 28 2011 the combined warehouse facility limit was 16 billion at that date 9430 million of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facilities and unused warehouse capacity totaled 6570 million during fiscal 2011 we entered into a second warehouse facility in order to stagger the warehouse facility renewal dates reduce risk and provide greater flexibility in addition we increased our combined warehouse facility capacity by 400 million as of february 28 2011 800 million of the warehouse facility limit will expire in august 2011 and 800 million will expire in february 2012 the securitization agreements related to the warehouse facilities include various financial covenants as of february 28 2011 we were in compliance with the financial covenants we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing funding arrangements to meet caf’s future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements notes 5 and 11 include additional information on the warehouse facilities 

 

during fiscal 2011 we completed two term securitizations funding a total of 130 billion of auto loan receivables despite the normalization of the credit markets we took actions in fiscal 2011 that we believe will better position us to provide consumer financing in the event of future disruptions in the credit markets should they occur these steps included entering into the second warehouse facility with a staggered renewal date increasing the overall warehouse facility capacity and entering into arrangements with several of our thirdparty financing providers where they are purchasing a portion of the auto loans that previously would have been originated by caf we believe by purchasing these loans the thirdparty providers will gain a greater understanding of the advantages of our unique origination channel 

 

in fiscal 2009 we believed it was prudent to maintain a cash balance in excess of our operating requirements due to the unprecedented conditions in the credit markets during that time cash and cash equivalents as of february 28 2009 reflected this decision 

 

cash received on equity issuances which primarily related to employee stock option exercises was 383 million in fiscal 2011 313 million in fiscal 2010 and 102 million in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 the receipts included exercises prompted by the increase in our stock price during those years 

 

we expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements saleleaseback transactions and borrowings under existing new or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

auto loan receivables 

as of february 28 2011 and 2010 all loans in our portfolio of auto loan receivables were fixedrate installment loans financing for these auto loan receivables was achieved through asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and floatingrate securities our derivative instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of our known or expected cash receipts and our known or expected cash payments principally related to the funding of our auto loan receivables disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies other receivables are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with derivative instruments are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments notes 6 and 7 provide additional information on derivative instruments 

 

composition of auto loan receivables 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

interest rate exposure 

we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt substantially all of our debt is floatingrate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2011 net earnings per share by less than 001

 item 1 business 

business overview 

carmax background carmax inc was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond virginia 

under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax superstore in richmond virginia in 1997 circuit city completed the initial public offering of a tracking stock circuit city stores inc–carmax group common stock which was intended to track separately the performance of the carmax operations on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent publicly traded company 

carmax business we are the nation’s largest retailer of used cars based on the 357129 used vehicles we retailed during the fiscal year ended february 28 2010 as of the end of fiscal 2010 we operated 100 used car superstores in 46 metropolitan markets in addition we sold 197382 wholesale vehicles in fiscal 2010 through onsite auctions 

we were the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality used vehicles at competitively low “nohaggle” prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility the carmax consumer offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers and it is structured around four customer benefits low nohaggle prices a broad selection high quality vehicles and a customerfriendly sales process our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems 

 

 

we purchase recondition and sell used vehicles all of the used vehicles we retail are thoroughly reconditioned to meet our high standards and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale in fiscal 2010 approximately 90 of the used vehicles we retailed were 1 to 6 years old with fewer than 60000 miles we also offer a selection of used vehicles at each superstore that are more than 6 years old or have more than 60000 miles if they meet similar quality standards 

we also sell new vehicles at five locations under franchise agreements with four new car manufacturers chrysler general motors nissan and toyota in fiscal 2010 new vehicles comprised 2 of our total retail vehicle unit sales 

we provide customers with a full range of related products and services including the financing of vehicle purchases through carmax auto finance “caf” our own finance operation and thirdparty financing providers the sale of extended service plans guaranteed asset protection and accessories the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers and vehicle repair service 

the carmax consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options terms and associated prices of each component the customer can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer our nohaggle pricing and our commission structure which is generally based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard allow sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make an offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us historically we have acquired the majority of our retail used vehicle inventory through this unique instore appraisal process we also acquire a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory through wholesale auctions and to a lesser extent directly from other sources including wholesalers dealers and fleet owners vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through onsite wholesale auctions 

our proprietary inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process using the information provided by this system and applying statistical modeling techniques we are able to optimize our inventory mix anticipate future inventory needs at each store evaluate sales consultant and buyer performance and refine our vehicle pricing strategy because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and pricing system generally more than 99 of the entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

industry and competition the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive according to industry sources as of december 31 2009 there were approximately 18600 franchised automotive dealerships who sell both new and used vehicles in addition used vehicles were sold by approximately 36500 independent used vehicle dealers as well as millions of private individuals our primary competitors are the franchised auto dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles independent used car dealers predominantly sell older higher mileage cars than we do the number of franchised and independent auto dealers has gradually declined over the last decade the rate of dealership closures accelerated in 2008 and 2009 due to the recessionary environment the sharp decline in industry sales the challenging credit conditions and the bankruptcies of general motors and chrysler despite the recent acceleration in dealership closures the automotive retail environment remains highly fragmented 

based on industry data there were approximately 35 million used cars sold in the us in calendar year 2009 of which approximately 15 million were estimated to be latemodel 1 to 6 year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us selling more than two times as many used vehicles as the next largest retailer in calendar 2009 we still represented only approximately 2 of the total latemodel used units sold over the last several years competition has been affected by the increasing use of internetbased marketing for both used vehicles and vehicle financing in both the used and new vehicle markets we seek to distinguish ourselves from traditional dealerships through our consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies 

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing are our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience our competitively low prices our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available both on site and via our website carmaxcom the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems and the locations of our retail stores upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfer fees may apply depending on the distance the vehicle needs to travel in fiscal 2010 more than 25 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request our certified quality inspection assures that every vehicle we offer for sale meets our stringent standards we back every vehicle with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty other competitive advantages include our ability to offer or arrange customer financing with competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of the extended service plans we offer we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas and that we enjoy advantages over competitors that employ traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques 

 

 

 

our sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid a commission based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the gross profit on the vehicle being sold the sales consultant normally receives no commission on the finance process this ensures that the sales consultant’s primary objective is helping customers find the right vehicles for their needs at prices they can afford in contrast sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships typically receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates and for steering customers toward vehicles with higher gross profit 

in the new vehicle market we compete with other franchised dealers historically the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional automotive selling methods we believe our customerfriendly lowpressure sales methods are points of competitive differentiation 

in our wholesale auctions we compete with other automotive auction houses we believe our principal competitive advantages include our high vehicle sales rate our conditional announcement and arbitration policies our broad geographic distribution and our dealerfriendly practices because we own the cars that we auction we generally sell between 97 and 100 of the vehicles offered which is substantially higher than the sales rate at most other auto auctions our policy of making conditional announcements noting mechanical and other issues found during our appraisal process is also not a typical practice used at other auctions of older higher mileage vehicles together these factors make our auctions attractive to dealers resulting in a high dealertocar attendance ratio 

marketing and advertising our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle we use market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor our marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area our marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts carmaxcom internet search engines and online classified listings television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer broadcast and internet advertisements are designed to drive customers to our stores and to carmaxcom 

we continue to adjust our marketing programs in response to the evolving media landscape we have customized our marketing program based on awareness levels in each market we are building awareness and driving traffic to our stores and carmaxcom by listing every retail vehicle on autotradercom carscom and usedcarscom we believe using these online classified services allows our vehicles to appear on sites that are visited by a majority of buyers of latemodel used vehicles who use the internet in their shopping process our advertising on the internet also includes advertisements on search engines such as google and yahoo 

our website carmaxcom is a marketing tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online the website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on each of the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated daily carmaxcom includes detailed information such as vehicle photos prices features specifications and store locations as well as advanced featurebased search capabilities and sorting and comparison tools that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and email alerts when new inventory arrives virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory can be transferred at customer request to their local superstore customers can contact sales consultants online via carmaxcom by telephone or by fax customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home including applying for financing and they need to visit the store only to sign the paperwork and pay for and pick up their vehicle our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2010 approximately 75 of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had visited our website first 

 

 

 

suppliers for used vehicles we acquire used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our instore appraisal process and through other sources including local regional and online auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the supply of used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors including the total number of vehicles in operation the rate of new vehicle sales which in turn generate usedcar tradeins and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions according to industry statistics there are approximately 250 million light vehicles in operation in the us in recent years generally between 10 million and 17 million new vehicles and between 35 million and 45 million used vehicles have been retailed annually and between 9 million and 10 million vehicles have been sold at wholesale auction each year 

our used vehicle inventory acquired directly from consumers through our appraisal process within our stores and carbuying centers helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the consumer preferences of each market we have replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which a carmaxtrained buyer appraises a customer’s vehicle and provides the owner with a written guaranteed offer that is good for seven days   an appraisal is available to every customer free of charge whether or not the customer purchases a vehicle from us based on their age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this instore appraisal process meet our highquality retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through onsite wholesale auctions 

the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers who handle both onsite appraisals and offsite auction purchases our buyers evaluate all used vehicles based on internal and external auction data and market sales as well as estimated reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases transportation costs our buyers in collaboration with our home office staff utilize the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system to decide which inventory to purchase at offsite auctions our inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross profit per unit 

based on consumer acceptance of the instore appraisal process our experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

suppliers for new vehicles our new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales service and dealer agreements among other things these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies a manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances in addition to selling new vehicles using our low nohaggle price strategy the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow us to perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 

seasonality historically our business has been seasonal typically our superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter when used vehicles generally experience proportionately more of their annual depreciation we believe this is partly the result of a decline in customer traffic as well as discounts on model year closeouts that can pressure pricing for latemodel used vehicles customer traffic generally tends to slow in the fall as the weather changes and as customers shift their spending priorities toward holidayrelated expenditures 

products and services 

merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices our used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as chrysler ford general motors honda hyundai kia mazda mitsubishi nissan subaru toyota and volkswagen and luxury brands such as acura bmw infiniti lexus and mercedes our primary focus is vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old have fewer than 60000 miles and generally range in price from 11000 to 30000 for the more costconscious consumer we also offer used cars that are more than 6 years old or have 60000 miles or more and that generally range in price from 8000 to 21000 

we have implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which we set nohaggle prices on both our used and new vehicles we believe that our pricing is competitive with the bestnegotiated prices in the market prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom autotradercom carscom and usedcarscom and where applicable in our newspaper advertising we extend our nohaggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction including vehicle appraisal offers financing rates accessories extended service plan pricing and vehicle documentation fees 

 

 

 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process this process includes a comprehensive certified quality inspection of the engine and all major systems including cooling fuel drivetrain transmission electronics suspension brakes steering air conditioning and other equipment as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle based on this quality inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our quality standards our service technicians complete vehicle inspections we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services we engage third parties specializing in those services some superstores depend upon nearby typically larger superstores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead 

all carmax used car superstores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by our extended service plans we also provide factoryauthorized service at all new car franchises we have developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that our retail repair service is conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as our other operations 

we believe that the efficiency of our reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by our modern facilities our information systems and our technician training and development process the training and development process and our compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of technicians identify opportunities for cost reduction and achieve highquality repairs our information systems provide the ability to track repair history and enable trend analysis which serves as guidance for our continuous improvement efforts 

wholesale auctions vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions as of february 28 2010 wholesale auctions were conducted at 50 of our 100 superstores and were generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned which depends on the number of stores and the market awareness of carmax and our instore appraisal offer in that market the typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers to participate in a carmax auction dealers must register with our centralized auction support group at which time we determine the purchase limit available to each dealer we make conditional announcements on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions the average auction sales rate was 97 in fiscal 2010 dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase 

customer credit   we offer customers a wide range of financing alternatives which we believe enhances the carmax consumer offer before the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed more than 35 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2010 customer credit applications are initially reviewed by caf and may also be reviewed by a thirdparty provider customers who are not approved by either caf or the initial thirdparty provider may be evaluated by other financial institutions having a wide array of financing sources increases discrete approvals and expands the options for our customers to this end we have tested and will continue to test other thirdparty providers 

customers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through our proprietary information system a majority of applicants receive a response within five minutes the vehicle financings are retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles financed for the majority of the contracts arranged by the thirdparty providers we are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per vehicle financed we have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their contract within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges 

extended service plans and guaranteed asset protection at the time of the sale we offer the customer an extended service plan we sell these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors under the thirdparty service plan programs we have no contractual liability to the customer the extended service plans have terms of coverage from 12 to 72 months depending on the vehicle mileage make and age we offer extended service plans at low fixed prices which are based primarily on the historical repair record of the vehicle make and model and the length of coverage selected all extended service plans that we sell other than manufacturer programs have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements we receive a commission from the administrator at the time the extended service plan is sold in fiscal 2010 more than half of the customers purchasing a used vehicle from carmax also purchased an extended service plan 

 

our extended service plan customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and to the thirdparty administrators’ nationwide network consisting of thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the quality of the services provided by this network as well as the broad scope of our extended service plans helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

in fiscal 2010 we introduced a guaranteed asset protection product “gap” that will pay the difference between the customer’s insurance settlement and the finance contract payoff amount on their vehicle in the case of a total loss or unrecovered theft we sell this product on behalf of an unrelated third party that is the primary obligor and we have no contractual liability to the customer gap has been designed to our specifications and is administered by the third party through privatelabel arrangements we receive a commission from the administrator at the time of sale 

systems 

our stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions using instore information kiosks customers can search our entire vehicle inventory through our website carmaxcom and print a detailed listing for any vehicle which includes the vehicle’s features and specifications and its location on the display lot our inventory management system tracks every vehicle through its life from purchase through reconditioning and testdrives to ultimate sale bar codes are placed on each vehicle and on each parking space on the display lot and all vehicle bar codes are scanned daily as a loss prevention measure testdrive information is captured on every vehicle using radio frequency identification devices linking the specific vehicle and the sales consultant we also capture data on vehicles we wholesale which helps us track market pricing a computerized finance application process and computerassisted document preparation ensure rapid completion of the sales transaction behind the scenes our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about many aspects of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity in addition our store system provides a direct link to our proprietary credit processing information system to facilitate the credit review and approval process 

our inventory management and pricing system allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each superstore this system also generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on complex algorithms that take into account factors including sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which minimizes the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit 

in addition to inventory management our electronic repair order system “ero” is used to sequence reconditioning procedures ero provides information that helps increase quality and reduce costs which further enhances our customer service and profitability 

through our centralized systems we are able to quickly integrate new stores into our store network allowing the new stores to rapidly achieve operating efficiency we continue to enhance and refine our information systems which we believe to be a core competitive advantage the design of our information systems incorporates offsite backups redundant processing and other measures to reduce the risk of significant data loss in the event of an emergency or disaster

 item 1a risk factors 

we are subject to various risks including the risks described below our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known or that we currently deem immaterial 

economic conditions   in the normal course of business we are subject to changes in general or regional us economic conditions including but not limited to consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates interest rates gasoline prices inflation personal discretionary spending levels unemployment levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general any significant changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer demand andor increase costs 

capital changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support our geographic expansion and financing of auto loan receivables could adversely affect growth and operating strategies further our current credit facility and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants andor performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants andor performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we use and have historically relied upon a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf initially we sell these receivables into our warehouse facility we periodically refinance the receivables through term securitizations changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market have led and could in the future lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or we could be required to seek alternative means to finance our loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse impact on our business sales and results of operations 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

thirdparty financing providers carmax provides financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty financing providers in the event that one or more of these thirdparty providers could no longer or choose not to provide financing to our customers could only provide financing to a reduced segment of our customers or could no longer provide financing at competitive rates of interest it could have a material impact on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace current thirdparty financing providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material impact on our business sales and results of operations 

competition   automotive retailing is a highly competitive business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers as well as millions of private individuals competitors sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices further new entrants to the market could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected vehicle sales and margins competition could be affected by the increasing use of the internet to market and potentially sell used vehicles and obtain vehicle financing the increasing use of the internet in the automotive retailing business could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations in addition caf is subject to competition from various financial institutions 

retail prices any significant changes in retail prices for used and new vehicles could reduce sales and profits if any of our competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices for used or new vehicles we would likely reduce our prices in order to remain competitive which could result in a decrease in our sales revenue and results of operations and require a change in our operating strategies 

 

 

  

inventory a reduction in the availability or access to sources of inventory could adversely affect our business a failure to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or a failure to recognize those trends could negatively impact the ability to acquire inventory should we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate the excess inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs would adversely affect our results of operations 

regulatory and legislative environment we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as licensing requirements and laws regarding advertising vehicle sales financing and employment practices our facilities and business operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety the violation of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against business operations as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenses and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations further over the past several years private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased their scrutiny of advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced 

during the past year there were several proposed comprehensive federal legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms and depending upon the scope of the final legislation if any we may experience an increase in expenses or a decrease in revenues certain new laws including legislation regarding health care employee relations and finance and tax reform could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

management and workforce our success depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we will need to hire additional personnel as we open new stores the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate is highly competitive and could result in increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 

information systems our business is dependent upon the efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales inventory consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain and continually enhance or protect the integrity of these systems could disrupt our business operations impact sales and results of operations expose us to customer or thirdparty claims or result in adverse publicity 

accounting policies and matters we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain materially different amounts could be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions 

additionally the financial accounting standards board is currently considering various proposed rule changes including but not limited to potential changes in accounting for leases the sec is currently considering adopting rules that would require us issuers to prepare their financial statements contained in sec filings in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” as issued by the international accounting standards board the implementation of these or other new accounting requirements or changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition 

confidential customer information   in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty service providers could be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information whether by us or by thirdparty service providers could damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our business or otherwise affect our results of operations 

  

  

growth our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion and could adversely affect our business and results of operations the expansion of our store base places significant demands on our management team our associates and our systems if we fail to effectively or efficiently manage our growth it could adversely affect our business sales and results of operations 

litigation we are subject to various litigation matters which could adversely affect our business claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

automotive manufacturers adverse conditions affecting one or more automotive manufacturers could impact our results of operations manufacturer recalls could also have an adverse effect on used vehicle sales or valuations 

weather the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes or other natural disasters could cause store closures adversely affecting consumer traffic and could adversely affect our results of operations 

seasonal fluctuations our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

geographic concentration our   performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large number of our superstores are located in the southeastern us and in the chicago los angeles and washington dcbaltimore markets our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experienced a downturn in economic conditions it could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

other material events the occurrence of certain material events including acts of terrorism the outbreak of war or other significant national or international events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

  




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

we conduct our used vehicle operations in two basic retail formats – production and nonproduction superstores production superstores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed while nonproduction superstores do not perform vehicle reconditioning in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction superstore on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm reconditioning needs and the available acreage of this and other sites in that market as a result some superstores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction superstores until we expand our presence in that market as of february 28 2010 we operated 59 production superstores and 41 nonproduction superstores at that date we also operated one new car store which was located adjacent to our used car superstore in laurel maryland our remaining five new car franchises are operated as part of our used car superstores 

production superstores are generally 40000 to 60000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres but a few range from approximately 70000 to 95000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres nonproduction superstores are generally 10000 to 25000 square feet on 4 to 12 acres 

 

used car superstores as of february 28 2010 

 

we have financed the majority of our stores through saleleaseback transactions as of february 28 2010 we leased 59 of our 100 used car superstores as well as our caf office building in atlanta georgia we owned the remaining 41 stores currently in operation and the 3 superstores that were constructed in fiscal 2009 and which we now plan to open in fiscal 2011 we also owned our home office building in richmond virginia and land associated with planned future store openings 

  

  

 

expansion 

prior to fiscal 2010 we had opened used car superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15 of our used car superstore base for several consecutive years as a result of the weak economic and sales environment in december 2008 we temporarily suspended store growth based on the improvements in our sales and profitability in fiscal 2010 as well as the increasing stability in the credit markets we plan to resume store growth in fiscal 2011 we plan to take a measured approach by opening three superstores in fiscal 2011 between three and five superstores in fiscal 2012 and between five and ten superstores in fiscal 2013 the three superstores that we plan to open in fiscal 2011 were constructed in fiscal 2009 but we chose not to open them until market conditions improved 

 

we continue to believe that we are well positioned to succeed in the highly competitive automotive retail industry we have built a strong foundation for future growth based upon our unique knowledge of the used car market established presence in key locations and ability to execute our business plan in a market subject to continuous change we continue to refine our operating strategies and have grown to be the nation’s largest retailer of used cars

business overview 

general 

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we pioneered the used car superstore concept opening our first store in 1993 our strategy is to revolutionize the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems as of february 28 2010 we operated 100 used car superstores in 46 markets comprised of 34 midsized markets 11 large markets and 1 small market we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000 and 25 million people we also operated six new car franchises in fiscal 2010 we sold 357129 used cars representing 98 of the total 364980 vehicles we sold at retail

we sell esps on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors as of february 28 2010 the used vehicle thirdparty esp providers were cna national warranty corporation and the warranty group we have no contractual liability to the customer under these thirdparty service plans esp revenue represents commissions from the unrelated third parties 

in fiscal 2010 we introduced a guaranteed asset protection product “gap” that will pay the difference between the customer’s insurance settlement and the finance contract payoff amount on their vehicle in the case of a total loss or unrecovered theft we sell gap on behalf of an unrelated third party who is the primary obligor as of february 28 2010 the thirdparty gap provider was safeguard products international llc we have no contractual liability to the customer for this product gap revenue represents commissions from the unrelated third party 

 

 

over the long term we believe the primary drivers for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth both from new stores and from stores included in our comparable store base as well as improvements in margins resulting from operational efficiencies we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price 

prior to fiscal 2010 we opened used car superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15 of our used car superstore base for several consecutive years as a result of the weak economic and sales environment in december 2008 we temporarily suspended store growth this suspension reduced our capital needs and growthrelated costs based on the improvements in our sales and profitability in fiscal 2010 as well as the increasing stability in the credit markets we plan to resume store growth in fiscal 2011 we plan to take a measured approach by opening three stores in fiscal 2011 between three and five stores in fiscal 2012 and between five and ten stores in fiscal 2013 we are still at a relatively early stage in the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 28 2010 we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 45 of the us population 

in the near term our principal challenges are related to the weak economic conditions and the resulting high unemployment rate and relatively low levels of consumer confidence all of which have caused a dramatic decline in industrywide auto sales when compared with prerecessionary levels longer term we believe the principal challenges we face will include our ability to build our management bench strength to support our store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate we staff each newly opened store with an experienced management team therefore we must recruit train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings 

fiscal 2010 highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

securitization transactions 

we maintain a revolving securitization program “warehouse facility” to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf until they can be funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement the securitization transactions are accounted for as sales a gain recorded at the time of securitization results from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables we retain an interest in the auto loan receivables that we securitize the retained interest includes the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables various reserve accounts required excess receivables and retained subordinated bonds 

the present value of the residual cash flows we expect to receive over the life of the securitized receivables is determined by estimating the future cash flows using our assumptions of key factors such as finance charge income loss rates prepayment rates funding costs and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk these assumptions are derived from historical experience and projected economic trends adjustments to one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the fair value of the retained interest the fair value of the retained interest could also be affected by external factors such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers changes in the strength of the economy and developments in the interest rate and credit markets note 2c includes a discussion of accounting policies related to securitizations note 4 includes a discussion of securitizations and provides a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect on the retained interest if there were variations from the assumptions used note 6 includes a discussion on fair value measurements in addition see the “carmax auto finance income” section of this mda for a discussion of the effect of changes in our assumptions 

as discussed in note 17 and in the “fiscal 2011 expectations – caf income” section of this mda we will adopt accounting standards updates “asus” 200916 and 200917 formerly statement of financial accounting standards nos 166 and 167 respectively effective march 1 2010 pursuant to these pronouncements we will recognize existing and future transfers of auto loan receivables into term securitizations as secured borrowings which will result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related notes payable to the investors on our consolidated balance sheets we will also account for future transfers of receivables into our warehouse facility as secured borrowings as of march 1 2010 we amended our warehouse facility agreement as a result the receivables that were funded in the warehouse facility at that date will be consolidated along with the related notes payable at their fair value in future periods caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings will no longer include a gain on the sale of loans originated and sold but instead will reflect the net interest margin generated by the auto loan receivables less direct caf expenses 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer we recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered net of a reserve for returns under our 5day moneyback guarantee a reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

 

 

we also sell esps and gap on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle because we are not the primary obligor under these products we recognize commission revenue at the time of sale net of a reserve for returns the reserve for cancellations is recorded based on historical experience and trends and results could be affected if future cancellations differ from historical averages 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted note 8 includes information regarding income taxes 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider available carrybacks future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation allowance recorded for capital loss carryforwards that may not be utilized before their expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 28 2010 will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 our 9 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2010 resulted from a 5 increase in average retail selling price and a 3 increase in unit sales the increase in the average retail selling price primarily reflected increases in our vehicle acquisition costs resulting from appreciation in wholesale industry used vehicle values after falling sharply in fiscal 2009 wholesale vehicle values climbed during much of fiscal 2010 which we believe in part reflected tight supply conditions that occurred as vehicle tradein activity slowed in tandem with the decline in new car industry sales 

the 3 unit sales growth reflected a 1 increase in comparable store used unit sales and sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base we experienced a significant improvement in sales execution in fiscal 2010 however the resulting increase in sales conversion rate was almost fully offset by a decline in customer traffic the improvement in sales conversion occurred despite the tightening of lending standards by our thirdparty finance providers and caf in fiscal 2010 which we estimate adversely affected our comparable store used unit sales growth by several percentage points continuing weak economic conditions caused our customer traffic to remain below the prior year level despite the fact that the government’s consumer assistance to recycle and save act “cars” or “cash for clunkers” new car incentive program generated a spike in traffic in late july and august 2009 similar to our experience with previous successful broadbased new car incentive programs we believe this program had a beneficial effect on our used car customer traffic and sales 

 

 

our data indicated that we increased our share of the latemodel used vehicle market by more than 10 in fiscal 2010 while the overall market contracted we believe our ability to grow market share year after year is a testament to the strength of our consumer offer and the preference for our brand 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 our 14 decrease in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2009 resulted from the combination of an 8 decline in unit sales and a 6 decrease in average retail selling price the decline in unit sales reflected a 16 decrease in comparable store used units partially offset by sales from newer superstores not yet in the comparable store base the decrease in the average retail selling price was primarily caused by a significant industrywide drop in wholesale used car prices during the first three quarters of the year which reduced our inventory acquisition costs early in fiscal 2009 the steep increase in the cost of gasoline caused a temporary shift in consumer demand away from suvs and trucks toward more fuelefficient vehicles however in the latter half of fiscal 2009 the combination of the decline in gasoline prices and the lower more affordable prices for these less fuelefficient vehicles caused our sales mix to return to the prior year levels 

we began to see the initial effects of the slowdown in the automotive retail market in the latter part of fiscal 2008 however the weakness in the economy and the stresses on consumer spending accelerated in fiscal 2009 causing customer traffic to decline sharply starting in late may 2008 these stresses included rising unemployment rates decreases in home equity values and personal wealth and record low levels of consumer confidence for the year the decline in customer traffic was slightly greater than the decrease in comparable store unit sales despite the more difficult environment the solid execution by our store teams allowed us to modestly improve our conversion rate compared with fiscal 2008 while both caf and our thirdparty providers tightened lending criteria for some higherrisk customer segments lack of credit availability was not a major contributor to the reduction in sales in fiscal 2009 our data indicated that we modestly gained market share in the latemodel used vehicle market in fiscal 2009 

new vehicle sales 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 new vehicle revenues declined 29 in fiscal 2010 the decrease was entirely the result of a corresponding decline in unit sales which primarily reflected the extremely soft new car industry sales trends for the brands we represent a reduction in sales volumes at our chevrolet franchise which is one of many franchises being terminated by general motors also contributed to the decline in new vehicle unit sales for the fiscal year ended february 28 2010 new car manufacturers reported a 15 decline in us new car unit sales 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 new vehicle revenues declined 29 in fiscal 2009 the decline was the result of a 28 decrease in unit sales and a 1 decrease in average selling price new vehicle unit sales primarily reflected the extremely soft new car industry sales trends as well as the sale of our orlando chryslerjeepdodge franchise in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 for the fiscal year ended february 28 2009 new car manufacturers reported a 23 decline in us new car unit sales 

wholesale vehicle sales 

our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering highquality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they could also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles wholesaled 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 the 8 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2010 resulted from a 6 increase in average wholesale vehicle selling price combined with a 2 increase in wholesale unit sales the increase in wholesale unit sales was mainly the result of a significant increase in our appraisal buy rate we believe the strong industrywide wholesale vehicle pricing environment and the resulting increases in our appraisal offers had a favorable effect on the buy rate the benefit of the improvement in appraisal buy rate was largely offset however by a doubledigit decline in appraisal traffic particularly in the first half of the year appraisal traffic was adversely affected by both the slowdown in our customer traffic and by the reduction in new car industry sales and the related used vehicle tradein activity 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 the 21 decrease in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2009 resulted from a 13 decrease in wholesale unit sales combined with a 10 decrease in average wholesale vehicle selling price the decline in unit sales primarily reflected a decrease in our appraisal traffic and to a lesser extent a decline in our appraisal buy rate appraisal traffic was affected by the overall slowdown in customer traffic industry wholesale prices for suvs trucks and other less fuel efficient vehicles fell sharply in the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 and prices for virtually all vehicle classes declined at an unprecedented rate during the third quarter reflecting the weak demand environment we believe the significant drop in wholesale market values which resulted in corresponding decreases in our appraisal offers contributed to the reduction in our buy rate 

 

 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of esps and gap reported in esp revenues service department sales and net thirdparty finance fees the fixed fees paid by thirdparty finance providers vary by provider reflecting their differing levels of credit risk exposure the thirdparty provider who purchases subprime financings purchases these loans at a discount which is reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the other thirdparty providers 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 other sales and revenues increased 2 in fiscal 2010 the increase was comprised of a 15 increase in esp revenues largely offset by a 94 decline in thirdparty finance fees esp revenues benefited from the 3 increase in used unit sales and the successful introduction of gap in fiscal 2010 in addition fiscal 2010 esp revenues benefited from modifications in pricing made during the second half of fiscal 2009 the decline in thirdparty finance fees primarily reflected a mix shift among providers which increased the percentage of vehicle sales financed by the subprime provider the subprime provider financed approximately 6 of our retail unit sales in fiscal 2010 compared with approximately 3 in fiscal 2009 in addition during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we curtailed our temporary strategy of routing a larger percentage of credit applications directly to the thirdparty finance providers we had originally implemented this practice in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 in order to slow the use of capacity in our warehouse facility during a period when the assetbacked securitization markets were severely disrupted the warehouse facility is used to provide initial funding for substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 other sales and revenues decreased 5 in fiscal 2009 esp revenues declined 5 compared with the 8 decrease in total used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2009 esp revenues benefited from a slow down in the rate of esp cancellations which we believe was the result of the decline in auto industry sales and tradeins thirdparty finance fees decreased 42 due to a combination of factors including the reduction in retail vehicle unit sales a shift in mix among providers and a change in discount arrangements with certain of the providers during fiscal 2009 collectively the thirdparty providers financed a larger percentage of our retail unit sales in the second half of fiscal 2009 as we chose to route more credit applications to these providers in order to slow the use of capacity in our warehouse facility

retail vehicle sales mix 

 

as of february 28 2010 we had a total of six new car franchises representing the chevrolet chrysler nissan and toyota brands in june 2009 we were notified by general motors that our chevrolet franchise in kenosha wisconsin will be terminated no later than october 2010 by this date we expect to stop selling new general motors vehicles at this site where we also have a used car superstore and a toyota franchise we do not expect this franchise termination to have a material effect on sales or earnings 

between fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2009 we opened five carbuying centers these are test sites at which we conduct appraisals and purchase but do not sell vehicles we will continue to evaluate the performance of these five centers before deciding whether to open additional ones in future years these test sites are part of our longterm program to increase both appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing selfsufficiency equal to the percentage of vehicles sold at retail that were purchased directly from consumers 

gross profit 

 

 

gross profit per unit 

 

 

 

 

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual fluctuation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit we employ a volumebased strategy and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement when customer traffic and sales are consistently strong we generally take fewer pricing markdowns which in turn benefits gross profit dollars per unit when the sales pace slows we may initially take more pricing markdowns which could pressure gross profit dollars per unit however as we are successful in reducing inventories to align them with a slower sales pace this may allow us to return to target levels of gross profit per unit over the past several years we have continued to refine our carbuying strategies which we believe has benefited used vehicle gross profit per unit 

 

 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 our used vehicle gross profit increased by 954 million or 15 to 7399 million from 6444 million in fiscal 2009 reflecting the combination of an 11 improvement in used vehicle gross profit dollars per unit and the 3 increase in used unit sales used vehicle gross profit per unit increased 207 to 2072 per unit compared with 1865 per unit in fiscal 2009 the improvement in gross profit per unit resulted from a combination of factors including our ongoing initiative to reduce waste in the vehicle reconditioning process we estimate that we achieved a sustainable reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately 200 per vehicle by the end of fiscal 2010 this reduction was primarily accomplished through our emphasis on the consistent application of our reconditioning standards across our entire store base the benefit of the yearoveryear appreciation in used vehicle wholesale values also contributed to our used vehicle gross profit in addition we believe continuing refinements to our proprietary inventory management systems and processes were contributing factors as we were able to increase inventory turns in fiscal 2010 despite our aggressive reductions in inventory in the previous year the improvement also reflected the belowaverage profitability reported early in fiscal 2009 when the initial slowdown in customer traffic and a rapid decline in underlying values of suvs and trucks put pressure on our used vehicle margins 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 our used vehicle gross profit decreased by 642 million or 9 to 6444 million from 7086 million in fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of the 8 decline in total used unit sales despite the difficult sales environment in fiscal 2009 gross profit per unit decreased only 13 to 1865 per unit several factors adversely affected our fiscal 2009 used vehicle gross profit per unit including a reduction in the percent of vehicles purchased directly from customers and the sharp decrease in wholesale industry prices these were largely offset however by our success in managing our inventories 

during fiscal 2009 we experienced a decline in both appraisal traffic and our buy rate which required us to source a larger percentage of our used vehicles at auction vehicles purchased at auction typically generate less gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased directly from consumers additionally wholesale industry prices for midsized and large suvs and trucks declined sharply in the spring and early summer of 2008 and this rapid decline in valuation resulted in margin pressure on this segment of inventory in the first half of fiscal 2009 

we believe that our ability to maintain a generally consistent level of gross profit per unit during fiscal 2009 despite the challenging sales environment and the unprecedented decline in wholesale market prices was due in large part to the effectiveness of our proprietary inventory management systems and processes in response to the sharp decline in traffic and sales that began in late may 2008 we rapidly reduced our used car inventories which brought them back in line with the current sales rates and minimized required pricing markdowns in the second half of the fiscal year compared with inventory levels at stores open as of february 29 2008 we had approximately 16500 fewer total used vehicle units in inventory as of february 28 2009 representing a 28 reduction due to the severe decline in customer traffic during fiscal 2009 we generally chose not to reduce our gross profit targets as we believed doing so in the current economic environment would not have spurred a sufficient increase in sales to offset the reduction in perunit profitability 

new vehicle gross profit 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 our new vehicle gross profit decreased 25 to 67 million from 90 million in fiscal 2009 the reduction primarily reflected the 29 decline in new vehicle unit sales partially offset by a 5 increase in new vehicle gross profit dollars per unit which improved to 858 per unit from 814 per unit in fiscal 2009 the industrywide reductions in new vehicle inventories and incentives related to the cash for clunkers program benefited the new vehicle gross profit dollars per unit in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008   our new vehicle gross profit decreased 42 to 90 million in fiscal 2009 from 154 million in fiscal 2008 reflecting the 28 reduction in total new unit sales and a 180 decline in gross profit per unit these reductions resulted from the sharp decline in new car industry sales and the resulting increase in competitiveness in the new car market 

  

  

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit has steadily increased over the last several years in part reflecting the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our carbuying strategies appraisal delivery processes and instore auction processes we have made continuous improvements in these processes which we believe has allowed us to become more efficient our instore auctions have benefited from initiatives to increase our dealertocar ratio which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices in addition the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased by 89 million or 5 to 1715 million from 1625 million in fiscal 2009 reflecting the combination of a 4 improvement in wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit and the 2 increase in wholesale unit sales wholesale gross profit per unit increased 32 to 869 per unit compared with 837 per unit in fiscal 2009 the improvement in the wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit primarily reflected the higher yearoveryear wholesale pricing environment we also achieved a new record dealertocar ratio at our auctions in fiscal 2010 with the resulting price competition among bidders contributing to the strong wholesale gross profit per unit 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 our wholesale vehicle gross profit decreased by 142 million or 8 to 1625 million from 1767 million in fiscal 2008 the reduction was driven by the 13 decline in wholesale vehicle unit sales partially offset by an increase in wholesale gross profit per unit of 43 or 5 to 837 per unit from 794 per unit in fiscal 2008 we experienced an improvement in our dealertocar ratio at our auctions in fiscal 2009 with the resulting price competition among bidders contributing to the strong wholesale gross profit per unit our wholesale vehicles are predominantly comprised of older higher mileage vehicles and we believe the demand for these types of vehicles remained strong from dealers who specialize in selling to creditchallenged customers 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to esp and gap revenues net thirdparty finance fees and service department sales we have no cost of sales related to esp and gap revenues or net thirdparty finance fees as these represent commissions paid to us by the thirdparty providers accordingly changes in the relative mix of the other gross profit components can affect the composition of other gross profit 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 other gross profit increased by 286 million or 19 to 1808 million from 1522 million in fiscal 2009 other gross profit per unit increased 68 or 16 to 495 per unit from 427 per unit in fiscal 2009 esp gross profit increased 193 million or 15 benefiting from the introduction of gap the modifications in pricing made during the second half of fiscal 2009 and the 3 increase in used unit sales service department gross profit grew 236 million primarily because our retail vehicle sale growth outpaced fixed service overhead costs the increases in esp and service department gross profit were partially offset by a 143 million reduction in net thirdparty finance fees which were adversely affected by the mix shift among providers and the termination of our temporary practice of reducing caf originations by routing more credit applications to our thirdparty providers 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008   other gross profit decreased by 196 million or 11 to 1522 million from 1718 million in fiscal 2008 this decrease primarily reflected the reductions in used and new retail unit sales and the related impact on esp revenues and thirdparty finance fees and a 10 decline in other gross profit per unit in fiscal 2009 the decline in other gross profit per unit was primarily associated with the increase in mix of other revenues represented by service department sales 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not been a significant contributor to results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than on average retail prices however increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit the sga ratio and caf income to the extent the average amount financed also increases 

during fiscal 2010 we experienced a period of strong appreciation in used vehicle wholesale pricing we believe the appreciation resulted in part from a reduced supply of used vehicles in the market that was caused by the dramatic decline in new car industry sales and the associated slow down in used vehicle tradein activity the appreciation also reflected a rebound in pricing compared with the severe depreciation experienced in the previous year the higher wholesale values increased both our vehicle acquisition costs and our average selling prices for used and wholesale vehicles 

 

 

during fiscal 2009 the weakness in the economy and the stresses on consumer spending contributed to the industrywide slowdown in the sale of new and used vehicles and to the unprecedented decline in wholesale market prices for most vehicle classes during the first three quarters of the year these lower wholesale values reduced our vehicle acquisition costs and contributed to the decline in our used and wholesale vehicle average selling price 

carmax auto finance income 

caf provides financing for a portion of our used and new car retail sales because the purchase of a vehicle is often reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers while financing can also be obtained from thirdparty sources we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk furthermore we believe that our processes and systems the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans both for caf and for the thirdparty financing providers generally caf has provided us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on thirdparty financing sources 

components of caf income 

 

 

 

percent columns indicate 

2 percent of loans originated and sold “gain percentage” 

3 percent of average managed receivables 

4 percent of total net sales and operating revenues 

caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs or income we present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefits or costs that could be attributed to caf examples of indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources administrative services marketing information systems accounting legal treasury and executive payroll 

caf provides financing for qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest the majority of caf income has typically been generated by the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and the related cost of funds substantially all of the loans originated by caf are sold in securitization transactions a gain recorded at the time of securitization results from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables historically the gain on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans originated and sold the “gain percentage” has generally been in the range of 35 to 45 however the gain percentage was substantially below the low end of this range in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of the more challenging economic environment and the disruption in the global credit markets these factors caused us to increase the loss and discount rate assumptions that affect the gain recognized on the sale of loans and they increased our funding costs 

 

 

the gain on sales of loans originated and sold includes both the gain income recorded at the time of securitization and the effect of any subsequent changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs that are incurred in the same fiscal period that the loans were originated other losses or gains include the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous fiscal periods in addition other losses or gains could include the effects of new term securitizations changes in the valuation of retained subordinated bonds and the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing term securitizations as applicable 

between january 2008 and april 2009 we retained some or all of the subordinated bonds associated with our term securitizations we retained these subordinated bonds because at the applicable issue date the economics of doing so were more favorable than selling them during fiscal 2010 we retained subordinated bonds in connection with the april 2009 securitization of 10 billion of auto loans these subordinated bonds were issued at a discount and had a fair value of 1230 million as of february 28 2010 retained subordinated bonds are included in retained interest in securitized receivables on our consolidated balance sheets and their total fair value was 2488 million as of february 28 2010 874 million as of february 28 2009 and 431 million as of february 29 2008 changes in the fair value of the retained subordinated bonds are reflected in caf income 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 caf income increased to 1752 million from 153 million in fiscal 2009 in both periods caf results were affected by adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal years in fiscal 2010 the adjustments increased caf income by 267 million or 007 per share while in fiscal 2009 the adjustments reduced caf income by 818 million or 023 per share the fiscal 2010 adjustments included 

 

 

 

 

excluding the adjustments from both periods caf income increased to 1486 million from 970 million in fiscal 2009 caf’s gain on loans originated and sold climbed to 830 million from 465 million in fiscal 2009 the increase primarily reflected a significant improvement in the gain percentage partially offset by a reduction in the volume of loans originated and sold the gain percentage increased to 45 in fiscal 2010 from 24 in fiscal 2009 several factors contributed to this improvement the spread between the rates charged customers and caf’s funding costs increased largely due to lower benchmark rates in addition caf’s tightening of lending standards had a favorable effect on the expected net loss and discount rate assumptions used to value the related gain income and on the required credit enhancements the volume of caf loans originated and sold declined 4 to 186 billion from 193 billion in fiscal 2009 mainly reflecting a decline in the percentage of sales financed by caf net of 3day payoffs the number of units financed by caf as a percentage of total retail unit sales the “penetration rate” fell to slightly below 30 from 32 in fiscal 2009 primarily reflecting caf’s tightening of lending standards 

the increases in servicing fee income and direct caf expenses in fiscal 2010 were proportionate to the growth in average managed receivables the interest income component of other caf income which increased to 17 of average managed receivables from 12 in fiscal 2009 includes the interest earned on the retained subordinated bonds this growth in interest income primarily resulted from our increased holdings of retained subordinated bonds and higher yields on the subordinated bonds retained in connection with the april 2009 securitization 

 

 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 caf income declined to 153 million from 859 million in fiscal 2008 in both periods caf income was reduced by adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal years in fiscal 2009 these adjustments totaled 818 million or 023 per share and they included 

 

 

 

 

 

in fiscal 2008 the adjustments related to loans originated and sold in previous fiscal years totaled 96 million or 003 per share in fiscal 2009 caf’s gain on sales of loans originated and sold declined to 465 million compared with 581 million in fiscal 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in caf loan originations which were adversely affected by the decreases in our used unit sales and average retail selling price in addition it reflected a decrease in the percentage of sales financed by caf resulting from our election to slow the use of capacity in our warehouse facility during the second half of fiscal 2009 the gain percentage was 24 in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 compared with the prior year the effects of using higher loss and discount rate assumptions and higher credit enhancement levels for fiscal 2009 originations were offset by the benefit of a significant drop in our funding cost benchmark rate 

the increases in servicing fee income and direct caf expenses in fiscal 2009 were proportionate to the growth in average managed receivables the interest income component of other caf income increased to 12 of average managed receivables from 09 in fiscal 2008 primarily due to the increase in the discount rate assumption used to value the retained interest the use of a higher discount rate reduces the gain recognized at the time the loans are sold but increases the interest income recognized in subsequent periods additionally the growth in interest income reflected our increased holdings of retained subordinated bonds 

our term securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in the pool of auto loan receivables falls below 10 of the original pool balance this option was exercised two times in each of fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 in each case the remaining eligible receivables were subsequently resold into the warehouse facility these transactions did not have a material effect on caf income in any of the three fiscal years in future periods the effects of refinancing repurchase or resale activity could be favorable or unfavorable depending on the securitization structure and the market conditions at the transaction date

credit loss information 

 

 

we are at risk for the performance of the managed securitized receivables to the extent of our retained interest in the receivables if the managed receivables do not perform in accordance with the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the retained interest earnings could be affected our retained interest was 5524 million as of february 28 2010 compared with 3483 million as of february 28 2009 

during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 caf’s net loss and delinquency performance was weaker than historical averages we believe this was primarily the result of the weak economic environment which has adversely affected unemployment and industry trends for losses and delinquencies in response we tightened caf’s lending criteria in february and june 2009 in november 2009 one of our thirdparty finance providers began purchasing a large portion of the loans that caf would have originated prior to the tightening of lending standards offsetting the majority of the adverse sales effect of the tightening 

the average recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction historically the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42 to a high of 51 and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses primarily include rent and occupancy costs payroll expenses other than payroll related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service which is included in cost of sales fringe benefits advertising and other general expenses 

fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009 sga expenses were reduced 7 to 8187 million from 8824 million in fiscal 2009 despite the increase in unit sales in fiscal 2010 given the weak environment experienced in the last two years we felt it was prudent to take a particularly cautious approach to sga spending during fiscal 2010 accordingly we made significant curtailments in advertising implemented a wage freeze for all salaried and hourly associates and a hiring freeze at our home office reduced our management bench strength and deferred developmental and discretionary project spending the sga expense reduction also reflected decreases in growthrelated costs including preopening and relocation costs resulting from the suspension of store growth as well as benefits from a variety of wastereduction initiatives the sga ratio fell to 110 from 127 in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the reduction in sga expenses and the leverage associated with the increases in average selling prices and unit sales 

the fiscal 2010 sga expenses included the benefit of a favorable litigation settlement which increased net earnings by 002 per share while the fiscal 2009 sga expenses included various nonrecurring items which in the aggregate reduced net earnings by a total of 004 per share 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008   sga expenses increased 3 to 8824 million from 8584 million in fiscal 2008 although we increased our store base by 12 in fiscal 2009 in response to the decline in sales we focused on reducing store and corporate overhead costs including payroll and advertising our total number of associates declined to 13035 as of the end of fiscal 2009 from a peak of approximately 16400 in may 2008 the fiscal 2009 sga expenses also reflected reductions in growthrelated costs resulting from the suspension of store growth the sga ratio increased to 127 from 105 in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the significant declines in comparable store used unit sales and average selling price 

the fiscal 2009 sga expenses included a number of nonrecurring items which in the aggregate reduced net earnings by 004 per share these nonrecurring items included severance costs associated with a reduction in our service operations workforce in october 2008 costs for the termination of store site acquisitions resulting from our decision to temporarily suspend store growth and litigation costs partially offset by a benefit related to our decision to freeze our pension plan benefits as of december 31 2008 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 378 in fiscal 2010 388 in fiscal 2009 and 387 in fiscal 2008 the fiscal 2010 effective tax rate was slightly reduced by the favorable settlement of prior year tax audits 

operations outlook 

based upon improvements in our sales and profitability in fiscal 2010 and the increasing stability in the credit markets we have decided to resume store growth in fiscal 2011 we plan to take a measured approach by opening three superstores in fiscal 2011 between three and five superstores in fiscal 2012 and between five and ten superstores in fiscal 2013 this approach allows us to maintain momentum on recent initiatives to reduce waste and increase efficiency while still offering superior quality to customers it also allows us to rebuild our store management bench strength and to restart our real estate acquisition activity 

 

 

the three superstores we plan to open in fiscal 2011 were constructed in fiscal 2009 but we chose not to open them until market conditions improved 

fiscal 2011 planned superstore openings 

 

we currently estimate capital expenditures will total approximately 90 million in fiscal 2011 compared with the 224 million of capital spending in fiscal 2010 the increase in planned fiscal 2011 expenditures reflects real estate acquisitions and construction costs associated with the resumption of store growth as well as information technology and reconditioning equipment upgrades 

by the end of fiscal 2010 we had achieved a sustainable reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately 200 per vehicle these savings together with additional reductions that we believe are achievable will be available to continue to optimize future sales and profitability 

although we intend to maintain momentum on our initiatives to reduce waste and increase efficiencies to the extent the economy and our sales improve we would expect sga spending to increase from the level in fiscal 2010 reflecting the resulting increases in store and overhead spending including payroll advertising and other costs we also expect the resumption of store growth will result in an increase in growthrelated expenses including preopening costs advertising for new stores and rebuilding our store management bench strength in addition assuming no economic deterioration we plan to invest in some key initiatives to continue to enhance the carmax model these include continued improvements to carmaxcom and other information technology projects and additional training for associates 

fiscal 2011 expectations – caf income 

as of march 1 2010 we will adopt asus 200916 and 200917 pursuant to these pronouncements we will recognize existing and future transfers of auto loan receivables into term securitizations as secured borrowings which will result in recording the auto loan receivables and the related notes payable to the investors on our consolidated balance sheets term securitizations will be consolidated based on the unpaid principal balances less an appropriate reserve for credit losses we will also account for future transfers of receivables into our warehouse facility as secured borrowings 

as of march 1 2010 we amended our warehouse facility agreement as a result existing transfers of auto loan receivables no longer qualify for sale treatment the receivables that were funded in the warehouse facility at that date will be consolidated along with the related notes payable at their fair value 

as of march 1 2010 we expect the cumulative effect of these changes to result in a 37 billion increase in total assets net of a reserve for credit losses of approximately 58 million and a 38 billion increase in total liabilities 

the following unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet gives affect to the adoption of asus 200916 and 200917 and the amendment to our warehouse facility agreement 

 

 

 

 

 

the pro forma consolidated balance sheet as of march 1 2010 shown above includes the following adjustments 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in future periods caf income included in the consolidated statements of earnings will no longer include a gain on the sale of loans originated and sold but instead will reflect the net interest margin generated by the auto loan receivables less direct caf expenses the net interest margin will include the interest and certain other income associated with the auto loan receivables less a provision for estimated credit losses and the interest expense associated with the nonrecourse debt issued to fund these receivables 

including the effects of these changes we currently estimate that caf income will be in the range of 145 million to 185 million in fiscal 2011 many factors could affect the actual amount of caf income recognized including among others changes in consumer rates andor funding costs related to new loan originations changes in loan loss experience changes in the volume of caf loan originations changes in the value of derivative instruments and potential regulatory changes 

in future periods because our securitization transactions will be accounted for as secured borrowings rather than asset sales the cash flows from these transactions will be presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities notwithstanding this accounting treatment our securitizations are structured to legally isolate the receivables and we would not expect to be able to access the assets of our securitization trusts even in insolvency receivership or conservatorship proceedings we would however continue to have the rights associated with our retained interests in these trusts

financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities  we generated net cash from operating activities of 503 million in fiscal 2010 2646 million in fiscal 2009 and 795 million in fiscal 2008 compared with the prior year the 2143 million decline in cash from operating activities in fiscal 2010 occurred despite the significant increase in net income it primarily reflected the use of cash for increases in the retained interest in securitized receivables and inventory in fiscal 2010 while the prior year benefited from the generation of cash from a significant reduction in inventory 

select operating assets 

 

 

between january 2008 and april 2009 we retained some or all of the subordinated bonds associated with our term securitizations during this period market demand for assetbacked securities fell sharply and we retained the subordinated bonds because the economics of doing so were more favorable than selling them we believe the government’s term assetbacked securities loan facility “talf” program launched in march 2009 contributed to the subsequent increase in demand for auto assetbacked securities and we were able to sell all of the subordinated bonds in our term securitizations completed after april 2009 

the 2041 million increase in the retained interest in securitized receivables during fiscal 2010 primarily reflected the effects of retaining subordinated bonds in the april 2009 term securitization and the 640 million of favorable marktomarket adjustments primarily on retained subordinated bonds recognized during the year the 775 million increase in the retained interest during fiscal 2009 primarily reflected increases in the required excess receivables and the effects of retaining subordinated bonds in the may and july 2008 term securitizations partially offset by a decrease in interestonly strip receivables and the 320 million of marktomarket writedowns on retained subordinated bonds recognized during fiscal 2009 

 

 

the 1400 million increase in inventory during fiscal 2010 reflected the increase in our vehicle acquisition costs caused by appreciation in wholesale vehicle values combined with a 10 increase in used vehicle units in inventory the increase in units reflected the additional vehicles required to support recent sales trends the 2726 million reduction in inventory during fiscal 2009 primarily resulted from a 23 reduction in used vehicle units in inventory as well as a decline in vehicle acquisition costs for several vehicle categories including suvs and trucks the reduction in used vehicle inventory units occurred despite the 12 increase in our store base in fiscal 2009 we dramatically reduced total used vehicle inventory units in response to falling customer demand and sales levels during fiscal 2009 

the aggregate principal amount of outstanding auto loan receivables funded through securitizations which are discussed in notes 3 and 4 totaled 395 billion as of february 28 2010 383 billion as of february 28 2009 and 376 billion as of february 29 2008 during fiscal 2010 we completed four term securitizations funding a total of 257 billion of auto loan receivables we retained subordinated bonds in conjunction with one of these term securitizations these bonds were issued at a discount and they had a fair value of 1230 million as of february 28 2010 during fiscal 2009 we completed two term securitizations funding a total of 128 billion of auto loan receivables we retained subordinated bonds in conjunction with both of these transactions these bonds had a fair value of 780 million as of february 28 2010 

as of february 28 2010 the warehouse facility limit was 12 billion at that date 3310 million of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facility and unused warehouse capacity totaled 8690 million in august 2009 we renewed the warehouse facility which has a 364day term the size of the warehouse facility was reduced from the previous 14 billion as our thencurrent warehouse needs were lower than they were previously when economic conditions and our sales were stronger over the long term we anticipate that we will be able to enter into new or renew or expand existing funding arrangements to meet caf’s future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost for these arrangements could be significantly higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements the securitization agreement related to the warehouse facility includes various financial covenants as of february 28 2010 we were in compliance with the financial covenants note 4 includes additional discussion of the warehouse facility 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 213 million in fiscal 2010 1553 million in fiscal 2009 and 2570 million in fiscal 2008 capital expenditures totaled 224 million in fiscal 2010 1857 million in fiscal 2009 and 2531 million in fiscal 2008 the declines in capital spending in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 reflected our decision in december 2008 to temporarily suspend store growth in fiscal 2010 our capital spending primarily represented maintenance capital which is fairly modest because of the relatively young average age of our store base during fiscal 2009 we opened 11 used car superstores and we completed construction of 3 additional stores that are now planned to be opened in fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2008 we opened 12 used car superstores in addition to store construction costs capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 included the cost of land acquired for future year store openings 

historically capital expenditures have been funded with internally generated funds longterm debt and saleleaseback transactions net proceeds from the sales of assets totaled 07 million in fiscal 2010 343 million in fiscal 2009 and 11 million in fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2009 we completed saleleaseback transactions for our two used car superstores in austin texas valued at 313 million 

as of february 28 2010 we owned 41 used car superstores currently in operation 3 superstores that were constructed in fiscal 2009 prior to our suspension of store growth and that we plan to open in the first half of fiscal 2011 and our home office in richmond virginia in addition five superstores were accounted for as capital leases 

financing activities during fiscal 2010 net cash used in financing activities totaled 1513 million including a reduction in total debt of 1865 million during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 net cash provided by financing activities totaled 184 million and 1710 million respectively including increases in total debt of 78 million and 1489 million respectively the increase in total debt for fiscal 2009 was net of a 14 million noncash increase in longterm debt related to capital leases the increase in total debt for fiscal 2008 was net of a 66 million noncash decrease in longterm debt related to capital leases 

 

 

total debt and cash and cash equivalents 

 

 

starting in the second half of fiscal 2009 we believed that it was prudent to maintain a cash balance in excess of our normal operating requirements due to the unprecedented conditions in the credit markets given the subsequent stabilization in the financial sector we elected to resume maintaining a more normalized cash level in the latter half of fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2010 the reduction in total debt reflected the use of the excess cash to pay down debt as well as our increase in net earnings and the reduction in capital spending resulting from our temporary suspension of store growth in fiscal 2009 total debt increased only modestly as our significant reductions in inventory substantially offset the effects of the decline in net earnings and our increase in cash in fiscal 2008 we increased total debt primarily to fund increases in inventory and capital expenditures 

we have a 700 million revolving credit facility which expires in december 2011 the credit facility is secured by vehicle inventory and contains customary representations and warranties conditions and covenants as of february 28 2010 we were in compliance with the financial covenants borrowings under this credit facility are limited to 80 of qualifying inventory and they are available for working capital and general corporate purposes as of february 28 2010 based on thencurrent inventory levels we had additional borrowing capacity of 5054 million under the credit facility the outstanding balance included 09 million classified as shortterm debt and 1216 million classified as current portion of longterm debt we classified 1216 million as current portion of longterm debt based on our expectation that this balance will not remain outstanding for more than one year 

cash received on equity issuances which primarily related to employee stock option exercises was 313 million in fiscal 2010 102 million in fiscal 2009 and 147 million in fiscal 2008 the fiscal 2010 receipts included exercises prompted by the increase in our stock price during the fiscal year 

we expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements saleleaseback transactions and borrowings under existing or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future 

fair value measurements as described in note 6 we reported money market securities retained interest in securitized receivables and financial derivatives at fair value 

the retained interest in securitized receivables was valued at 5524 million as of february 28 2010 and 3483 million as of february 28 2009 included in the retained interest were interestonly strip receivables various reserve accounts and required excess receivables totaling 3036 million and 2609 million respectively as of these dates in addition the retained interest included retained subordinated bonds with a total fair value of 2488 million as of february 28 2010 and 874 million as of february 28 2009 

as described in note 4 we use discounted cash flow models to measure the fair value of the retained interest excluding the retained subordinated bonds in addition to funding costs and prepayment rates the estimates of future cash flows are based on certain key assumptions such as finance charge income loss rates and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk both of which are significant unobservable inputs changes in these inputs could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

in measuring the fair value of the retained subordinated bonds we use a widely accepted thirdparty bond pricing model our key assumption is determined based on current market spread quotes from thirdparty investment banks and is currently a significant unobservable input changes in this input could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

 

during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 changes were made to certain key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the retained interest see the carmax auto finance income section of mda for a discussion of the effects of these changes 

as the key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the retained interest including the retained subordinated bonds are significant unobservable inputs the retained interest is classified as a level 3 asset as of february 28 2010 the retained interest represented 944 of the total assets measured at fair value as disclosed in note 6

offbalance sheet arrangements 

caf provides financing for a portion of our used and new car retail sales we use the warehouse facility to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf until they can be funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement we sell the auto loan receivables to a wholly owned bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that transfers an undivided interest in the receivables to entities formed by thirdparty investors 

historically we have used term securitizations to refinance the receivables previously securitized through the warehouse facility the purpose of term securitizations is to provide permanent funding for these receivables in these transactions a pool of auto loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose securitization trust 

additional information regarding the nature business purposes and importance of our offbalance sheet arrangement to our liquidity and capital resources can be found in the carmax auto finance income operations outlook financial condition and market risk sections of mda as well as in notes 3 and 4 as described in the operations outlook section these offbalance sheet arrangements will be reflected on our consolidated balance sheets effective march 1 2010 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

auto loan receivables 

as of february 28 2010 and 2009 all loans in our portfolio of auto loan receivables were fixedrate installment loans financing for these auto loan receivables was achieved through asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and floatingrate securities we manage the interest rate exposure relating to floatingrate securitizations through the use of interest rate swaps disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies receivables held for investment or sale are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with financial derivatives are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments notes 5 and 6 provide additional information on financial derivatives 

composition of auto loan receivables 

 

 

 

 

 

interest rate exposure 

we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt substantially all of our debt is floatingrate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2010 net earnings per share by 001

we purchase recondition and sell used vehicles all of the used vehicles we retail are thoroughly reconditioned to meet high mechanical electrical safety and cosmetic standards and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale approximately 85 of the used vehicles we retail are 1 to 6 years old with fewer than 60000 miles we also offer a selection of used vehicles at each superstore that are more than 6 years old or have more than 60000 miles if they meet similar quality standards 

 

we also sell new vehicles at five locations under franchise agreements with four new car manufacturers chrysler general motors nissan and toyota in fiscal 2009 new vehicles comprised 3 of our total retail vehicle unit sales 

 

we provide customers with a full range of related products and services including the financing of vehicle purchases through carmax auto finance “caf” our own finance operation and thirdparty financing providers the sale of extended service plans and accessories the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers and vehicle repair service 

 

the carmax consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options terms and associated prices of each component the customer can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer our nohaggle pricing and our commission structure which is generally based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard allow sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

 

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make an offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us historically we have acquired the majority of our retail used vehicle inventory through this unique instore appraisal process we also acquire a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory through wholesale auctions and to a lesser extent directly from other sources including wholesalers dealers and fleet owners vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through onsite wholesale auctions 

 

our inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process using the information provided by this system and applying statistical modeling techniques we are able to optimize our inventory mix anticipate future inventory needs at each store evaluate sales consultant and buyer performance and refine our vehicle pricing strategy because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and pricing system more than 99 of the entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

 

industry and competition the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive according to industry sources in december 2008 there were approximately 20000 franchised automotive dealerships who sell both new and used vehicles in addition used vehicles were sold by approximately 39000 independent used vehicle dealers as well as millions of private individuals our primary competitors are the franchised auto dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles independent used car dealers predominantly sell older higher mileage cars than we do during fiscal 2009 the recessionary environment reduced consumers desire and ability to purchase vehicles and it also increased the rate of dealership closures in the coming year while the financial strains of the current economy will likely cause additional dealerships to close or consolidate at a higherthanaverage rate we expect the industry to remain highly fragmented 

 

based on industry data there were more than 36 million used cars sold in the us in calendar year 2008 of which approximately 16 million were estimated to be latemodel 1 to 6 year old vehicles while we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the us selling nearly twice as many used vehicles as the next largest retailer in calendar 2008 we still represented only approximately 2 of the total latemodel used units sold over the last several years competition has been affected by the increasing use of internetbased marketing for both used vehicles and vehicle financing in both the used and new vehicle markets we seek to distinguish ourselves from traditional dealerships through our consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies 

 

we believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing are our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience our competitively low prices our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available both on site and via our website carmaxcom the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems and the locations of our retail stores upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfer fees may apply depending on the distance the vehicle needs to travel in fiscal 2009 nearly 25 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request our 

 

  

  

 

certified quality inspection assures that every vehicle we offer for sale meets stringent mechanical electrical and safety standards we back every vehicle with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty other competitive advantages include our ability to offer or arrange customer financing with competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of the extended service plans we offer we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas and that we enjoy advantages over competitors that employ traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques 

 

our sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid a commission based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the gross profit on the vehicle being sold the sales consultant normally receives no commission on the finance process this ensures that the sales consultant’s primary objective is helping customers find the right vehicles for their needs at prices they can afford in contrast sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships typically receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates and for steering customers toward vehicles with higher gross profit 

 

in the new vehicle market we compete with other franchised dealers historically the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional automotive selling methods we believe our customerfriendly lowpressure sales methods are points of competitive differentiation 

 

in our wholesale auctions we compete with other automotive auction houses we believe our principal competitive advantages include our high vehicle sales rate our conditional announcement and arbitration policies our broad geographic distribution and our dealerfriendly practices because we own the cars that we auction we generally sell between 97 and 100 of the vehicles offered which is substantially higher than the sales rate at most other auto auctions our policy of making conditional announcements noting mechanical and other issues found during our appraisal process is also not a typical practice used at other auctions of older higher mileage vehicles together these factors make our auctions attractive to dealers and they allow us to achieve a dealertocar attendance ratio that is much higher than the typical auto auction 

 

marketing and advertising our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle we use market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor our marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area our marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts carmaxcom internet search engines and online classified listings television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer broadcast and internet advertisements are designed to drive customers to our stores and to carmaxcom newspaper advertisements promote our broad selection of vehicles and price competitiveness targeting consumers with immediate purchase intentions 

 

we continue to adjust our marketing programs in response to the evolving media landscape we have customized our marketing program based on awareness levels in each market in many markets we have expanded the use of internetbased advertising while curtailing the use of newspaper advertising we are building awareness and driving traffic to our stores and carmaxcom by listing every retail vehicle on both autotradercom and carscom through their syndicated networks autotradercom and carscom vehicle listings appear on sites that we believe are visited by a majority of buyers of latemodel used vehicles who use the internet in their shopping process our advertising on the internet also includes banner and keyword advertisements on search engines such as google and yahoo 

 

our website carmaxcom is a marketing tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online the website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on each of the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated daily carmaxcom includes detailed information such as vehicle photos prices features specifications and store locations as well as advanced featurebased search capabilities and sorting and comparison tools that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and email alerts when new inventory arrives virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory can be transferred at customer request to their local superstore customers can contact sales consultants online via carmaxcom by telephone or by fax customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home including applying for financing and they need to visit the store only to sign the paperwork and pay for and pick up their vehicle our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2009 more than 70 of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had visited our website first 

 

  

  

 

suppliers for used vehicles we acquire used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our instore appraisal process and through other sources including local regional and online auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies in calendar 2008 more than 36 million used vehicles were remarketed in the us of which approximately 9 million had been sourced at wholesale auction 

 

our used vehicle inventory acquired directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the tastes of each market in fiscal 2007 we began testing a standalone carbuying center in atlanta georgia our goal for the carbuying center was to increase appraisal traffic and generate incremental vehicle purchases from individual consumers we expanded this test in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 and we operated a total of five carbuying centers as of february 28 2009 

 

we have replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which a carmaxtrained buyer appraises a customer’s vehicle and provides the owner with a written guaranteed offer that is good for seven days   an appraisal is available to every customer free of charge whether or not the customer purchases a vehicle from us based on their age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this instore appraisal process meet our high quality retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through onsite wholesale auctions 

 

the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers who handle both onsite appraisals and offsite auction purchases our buyers evaluate all used vehicles based on internal and external auction data and market sales as well as estimated reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases transportation costs our buyers in collaboration with our home office staff utilize the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system to decide which inventory to purchase at offsite auctions our inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross profit per unit 

 

based on consumer acceptance of the instore appraisal process our experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs 

 

suppliers for new vehicles our new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales service and dealer agreements among other things these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies a manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances including a change in ownership without prior manufacturer approval failure to maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings or a material breach of other provisions of the agreement in addition to selling new vehicles using our low nohaggle price strategy the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow us to perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 

 

seasonality historically our business has been seasonal typically our superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically slowest in the fall quarter when used vehicles generally experience proportionately more of their annual depreciation we believe this is partly the result of a decline in customer traffic as well as discounts on model year closeouts that can pressure pricing for latemodel used vehicles customer traffic generally tends to slow in the fall as the weather changes and as customers shift their spending priorities toward holidayrelated expenditures in fiscal 2009 the traditional seasonal sales patterns were masked by the weakness in the economy and the stresses on consumer spending which adversely affected industrywide auto sales 

 

products and services 

merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices our used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as chrysler ford general motors honda hyundai mazda mitsubishi nissan subaru toyota and volkswagen and luxury brands such as acura bmw infiniti lexus and mercedes our primary focus is vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old have fewer than 60000 miles and generally range in price from 11000 to 28000 for the more costconscious consumer we also offer used cars that are more than 6 years old or have 60000 miles or more and that generally range in price from 7700 to 20000 

 

  

  

 

we have implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which we set nohaggle prices on both our used and new vehicles we believe that our pricing is competitive with the bestnegotiated prices in the market prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom autotradercom and carscom and where applicable in our newspaper advertising we extend our nohaggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction including vehicle appraisal offers financing rates accessories extended service plan pricing and vehicle documentation fees 

 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process this process includes a comprehensive certified quality inspection of the engine and all major systems including cooling fuel drivetrain transmission electronics suspension brakes steering air conditioning and other equipment as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle based on this quality inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our high quality standards our service technicians complete vehicle inspections   we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services we engage third parties specializing in those services some superstores   depend upon nearby  typically larger superstores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead 

 

all carmax used car superstores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by our extended service plans we also provide factoryauthorized service at all new car franchises we have developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that our retail repair service is conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as our other operations 

 

we believe that the efficiency of our reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by our modern facilities a technician mentoring process and our information systems the mentoring process and our compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of technicians identify opportunities for cost reduction and achieve highquality repairs our information systems provide the ability to track repair history and enable trend analysis which serves as guidance for our continuous improvement efforts 

 

wholesale auctions vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions as of february 28 2009 wholesale auctions were conducted at 49 of our 100 superstores and were generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned which depends on the number of stores and the market awareness of carmax and our instore appraisal offer in that market the typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers to participate in a carmax auction dealers must register with our centralized auction support group at which time we determine the purchase limit available to each dealer we make conditional announcements on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions the average auction sales rate was 97 in fiscal 2009 dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase 

 

customer credit   we offer customers a wide range of financing alternatives which we believe enhances the carmax consumer offer before the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed more than 40 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2009 customer credit applications are initially reviewed by caf and may also be reviewed by a thirdparty provider customers who are not approved by either caf or the initial thirdparty provider may be evaluated by other lenders having a wide array of financing sources not only increases discrete approvals but also expands the choices for our customers to this end we have tested and will continue to test other thirdparty providers 

customers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through our proprietary information system a majority of applicants receive a response within five minutes the vehicle financings are retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles financed for the majority of the loans arranged by the thirdparty providers we are paid a fixed prenegotiated fee per vehicle financed we have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their loans within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges 

 

extended service plans at the time of the sale we offer the customer an extended service plan we sell these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors under the thirdparty service plan programs we have no contractual liability to the customer the extended service plans have terms of coverage from 12 to 72 months depending on the vehicle mileage make and age we offer extended service plans at low fixed prices which are based primarily on the historical repair record of the vehicle make and 

 

  

  

 

model and the length of coverage selected all extended service plans that we sell other than manufacturer programs have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements we receive a commission from the administrator at the time the extended service plan is sold in fiscal 2009 more than half of the customers purchasing a used vehicle from carmax also purchased an extended service plan 

 

our extended service plan customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and to the thirdparty administrators’ nationwide network consisting of thousands of independent and franchised service providers we believe that the quality of the services provided by this network as well as the broad scope of our extended service plans helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

 

systems 

our stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions using instore information kiosks customers can search our entire vehicle inventory and print a detailed listing for any vehicle which includes the vehicle’s features and specifications and its location on the display lot our inventory management system tracks every vehicle through its life from purchase through reconditioning and testdrives to ultimate sale bar codes are placed on each vehicle and on each parking space on the display lot and all vehicle bar codes are scanned daily as a loss prevention measure testdrive information is captured on every vehicle using radio frequency identification devices linking the specific vehicle and the sales consultant we also capture data on vehicles we wholesale which helps us track market pricing an online finance application process and computerassisted document preparation ensure rapid completion of the sales transaction behind the scenes our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about every aspect of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity in addition our store system provides a direct link to our proprietary credit processing information system to facilitate the credit review and approval process 

 

our inventory management and pricing system allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each superstore this system also generates recommended initial retail price points as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on complex algorithms that take into account factors including sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which minimizes the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit 

 

in addition to inventory management our electronic repair order system “ero” is used by the service department to sequence reconditioning procedures ero provides information that helps increase quality and reduce costs which further enhances our customer service and profitability 

 

through our centralized systems we are able to immediately integrate new stores into our store network allowing the new stores to rapidly achieve operating efficiency we continue to enhance and refine our information systems which we believe to be a core competitive advantage the design of our information systems incorporates offsite backups redundant processing and other measures to reduce the risk of significant data loss in the event of an emergency or disaster 

 

associates 

on february 28 2009 we had a total of 13035 associates including 10101 hourly and salaried associates and 2934 sales associates who worked on a commission basis sales consultants include both fulltime and parttime employees we employ additional associates during peak selling seasons as of february 28 2009 our location general managers averaged more than nine years of carmax experience in addition to prior retail management experience we open new stores with experienced management teams drawn from existing stores 

 

we believe we have created a unique corporate culture and maintain good employee relations no associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement we focus on providing our associates with the information and resources they need to offer exceptional customer service we reward associates whose behavior exemplifies our culture and we believe that our favorable working conditions and compensation programs allow us to attract and retain highly qualified individuals we have been recognized for the success of our efforts by a number of external organizations 

 

 

  

  

 

training to further support our emphasis on attracting developing and retaining qualified associates we have made a commitment to providing exceptional training programs on average each store associate completed at least 13 online or classroom courses totaling more than 57 hours of training per associate in fiscal 2009 store associates receive structured selfpaced training that introduces them to company policies and their specific job responsibilities through kmx university – our proprietary intranetbased testing and tracking system kmx university is comprised of customized applications hosted within a learning management system that allow us to author deliver and track training events and to measure associate competency before and after training in fiscal 2009 nearly one million hours of training were delivered through kmx university most new store associates are also assigned mentors who provide onthejob guidance and support 

 

we also provide comprehensive facilitatorled classroom training courses to sales consultants buyers automotive technicians and managers all sales consultants receive extensive customer service training both initially and on an ongoing basis buyersintraining undergo a 6 to 18month apprenticeship under the supervision of experienced buyers and they generally will assist with the appraisal of more than 1000 cars before making their first independent purchase we utilize a mix of internal and external technical training programs in an effort to provide a stable future supply of qualified technicians reconditioning and mechanical technicians attend inhouse and vendorsponsored training programs designed to develop their skills in performing repairs on the diverse makes and models of vehicles we sell technicians at our new car franchises also attend manufacturersponsored training programs to stay abreast of current diagnostic repair and maintenance techniques for those manufacturers’ vehicles additionally our new managers attend an intensive weeklong workshop at the home office where they meet with senior leaders and learn fundamental carmax management skills

 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to various risks including the risks described below our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known or that we currently deem immaterial 

economic conditions   in the normal course of business we are subject to changes in general or regional us economic conditions including but not limited to consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates interest rates gasoline prices inflation personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general any significant changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer demand andor increase costs 

capital changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the longterm financing to support our geographic expansion when resumed and financing of auto loan receivables could adversely affect growth and operating strategies further our current credit facility and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants andor performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants andor performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we use and have historically relied upon a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf initially we sell these receivables into our warehouse facility we periodically refinance the receivables through term securitizations changes in the condition of the assetbacked securitization market have led and could in the future lead us to incur higher costs to access funds in this market or we could be required to seek alternative means to finance our loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse impact on our business sales and results of operations 

disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if our ability to secure funds from the facility were significantly impaired our access to working capital would be impacted our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels could be affected and these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

thirdparty financing providers carmax provides financing to qualified customers through caf and a number of thirdparty financing providers in the event that one or more of these thirdparty providers could no longer or choose not to provide financing to our customers could only provide financing to a reduced segment of our customers or could no longer provide financing at competitive rates of interest it could have a material impact on our business sales and results of operations additionally if we were unable to replace current thirdparty financing providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events it could also have a material impact on our business sales and results of operations 

competition   automotive retailing is a highly competitive business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers as well as millions of private individuals competitors sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices further new entrants to the market could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected vehicle sales and margins competition could be affected by the increasing use of internetbased marketing for both used vehicles and vehicle financing customers are increasingly using the internet to compare pricing for cars and related financing which could further reduce sales and adversely affect our results of operations in addition caf is subject to competition from various financial institutions 

retail prices any significant changes in retail prices for used and new vehicles could reduce sales and profits if any of our competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices for used or new vehicles we would likely reduce our prices in order to remain competitive which could result in a decrease in our sales revenue and results of operations and require a change in our operating strategies 

  

  

inventory a reduction in the availability or access to sources of inventory would adversely affect our business a failure to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or a failure to recognize those trends could negatively impact the ability to acquire inventory should we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate the excess inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs would adversely affect our results of operations 

regulatory and legislative environment we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as licensing requirements and laws regarding advertising vehicle sales financing and employment practices our facilities and business operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and health and safety the violation of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a ceaseanddesist order against business operations as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations further over the past several years private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased their scrutiny of advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced 

the us congress is considering and may adopt various forms of legislation designed to spur automobile sales through the use of purchase vouchers tax credits and mass transit reimbursements depending on the legislation that is adopted if any these incentives may only be available to consumers who purchase new vehicles or vehicles achieving high fuelefficiency standards if these incentives are limited solely to purchasers of new vehicles or if we are unable to maintain an inventory of vehicles achieving the mandated fuelefficiency standards these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business sales results of operations and financial condition 

management and workforce our success depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition when we resume store growth we will need to hire additional personnel as we open new stores the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate is highly competitive and could result in increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 

information systems our business is dependent upon the efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales inventory consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain and continually enhance or protect the integrity of these systems could disrupt our business operations impact sales and results of operations expose us to customer or thirdparty claims or result in adverse publicity 

accounting policies and matters we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain materially different amounts could be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions 

additionally the financial accounting standards board is currently considering various proposed rule changes including but not limited to changes relating to the accounting for securitization transactions and potential changes in accounting for leases the sec is currently considering adopting rules that would require us issuers to prepare their financial statements contained in sec filings in accordance with international financial reporting standards “ifrs” as issued by the international accounting standards board the implementation of these or other new accounting requirements or changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial condition 

confidential customer information   in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty service providers could be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information whether by us or by thirdparty service providers could damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our business or otherwise affect our results of operations 

  

  

litigation we are subject to various litigation matters which could adversely affect our business claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

domesticbased automotive manufacturers adverse conditions affecting one or more domesticbased automotive manufacturers could impact our profitability recently the financial condition and operating results of these manufacturers have deteriorated significantly and it is possible that one or more of these manufacturers could file for bankruptcy protection certain actions that these manufacturers may take including bankruptcy filing could adversely affect consumer demand for and values of used vehicles produced by these manufacturers which could have a material effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

weather the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes or other natural disasters could cause store closures adversely affecting consumer traffic and could adversely affect our results of operations 

seasonal fluctuations our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on annual results of operations 

geographic concentration our   performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large number of our superstores are located in the southeastern us and in the chicago los angeles and washington dcbaltimore markets our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experienced a downturn in economic conditions it could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

real estate our inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit our expansion when resumed and could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations 

other material events the occurrence of certain material events including acts of terrorism the outbreak of war or other significant national or international events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 2 properties 

 

we conduct our used vehicle operations in two basic retail formats – production and nonproduction superstores production superstores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed while nonproduction superstores do not perform vehicle reconditioning in determining whether to construct a production or a nonproduction superstore on a given site we take several factors into account including the anticipated longterm reconditioning needs and the available acreage of this and other sites in that market as a result some superstores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as nonproduction superstores until we expand our presence in that market as of february 28 2009 we operated 59 production superstores and 41 nonproduction superstores at that date we also operated one new car store which was located adjacent to our used car superstore in laurel maryland our remaining five new car franchises are operated as part of our used car superstores 

 

production superstores are generally 40000 to 60000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres but a few range from approximately 70000 to 95000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres nonproduction superstores are generally 10000 to 25000 square feet on 4 to 12 acres 

 

used car superstores as of february 28 2009 

 

 

we have financed the majority of our stores through saleleaseback transactions as of february 28 2009 we leased 59 of our 100 used car superstores we owned the remaining 41 stores currently in operation and the three superstores that have been substantially completed but which will not be opened until market conditions improve we also own our home office building in richmond virginia and land associated with planned future store openings

for the last several years we expanded our store base by approximately 15 annually in august 2008 we announced that we would temporarily slow our store growth as a result of the weak economic and sales environment in december 2008 following further deterioration in market conditions we announced a temporary suspension in store growth at that time we had four stores under construction that we had originally planned to open in fiscal 2009 including stores in potomac mills virginia augusta georgia cincinnati ohio and dayton ohio we only opened the potomac mills store in our wellestablished washington dc market the remaining three stores were substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2009 and are in markets where carmax does not already have a presence and given the resulting low consumer awareness of our business model we chose not to open these stores until market conditions improve 

 

we continue to believe that we are well positioned to succeed in the highly competitive automotive retail industry we have built a strong foundation for future growth based upon our unique knowledge of the used car market established presence in key locations and ability to execute our business plan in a market subject to continuous change we continue to refine our operating strategies and have grown to be the nation’s largest retailer of used cars

business overview 

 

general 

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we pioneered the used car superstore concept opening our first store in 1993 our strategy is to better serve the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems as of february 28 2009 we operated 100 used car superstores in 46 markets comprised of 34 midsized markets 11 large markets and 1 small market we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000 and 25 million people we also operated six new car franchises in fiscal 2009 we sold 345465 used cars representing 97 of the total 356549 vehicles we sold at retail 

 

we believe the carmax consumer offer is distinctive within the auto retailing marketplace our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other big box retailers our consumer offer is structured around our four customer benefits low nohaggle prices a broad selection high quality vehicles and a customerfriendly sales process our website carmaxcom is a valuable tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer a sophisticated search engine and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct their shopping online we generate revenues income and cash flows primarily by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing extended service plans “esps” and vehicle repair service 

 

we also generate revenues income and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards these vehicles are sold through onsite wholesale auctions wholesale auctions are generally held on a weekly or biweekly basis and as of february 28 2009 we conducted auctions at 49 used car superstores during fiscal 2009 we sold 194081 wholesale vehicles on average the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers 

 

carmax provides financing to qualified retail customers through carmax auto finance “caf” our finance operation and a number of thirdparty financing providers as of february 28 2009 these third parties included bank of america dealer financial services capital one auto finance citifinancial auto santander consumer usa wachovia dealer services and wells fargo auto we collect fixed prenegotiated fees from the majority of the thirdparty providers and we periodically test additional providers carmax has no recourse liability for the financing provided by these third parties 

 

we sell esps on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors as of february 28 2009 the used vehicle thirdparty esp providers were cna national warranty corporation and the warranty group we have no contractual liability to the customer under these thirdparty service plans extended service plan revenue represents commissions from the unrelated third parties 

 

over the long term we believe the primary driver for earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth both from new stores and from stores included in our comparable store base we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price 

 

  

  

 

we are still at a relatively early stage in the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 28 2009 we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 45 of the us population prior to august 2008 we had planned to open used car superstores at a rate of approximately 15 of our used car superstore base each year in august 2008 we announced that we would temporarily slow our store growth as a result of the weak economic and sales environment in december 2008 following further deterioration in market conditions we announced a temporary suspension in store growth we believe this suspension will reduce our capital needs and improve profitability 

 

in the near term our principal challenges are related to the recession which caused a dramatic decline in industrywide auto sales and the disruption of the assetbacked securitization market which historically has been used to provide funding for caf loan originations in fiscal 2009 we experienced a large decline in customer traffic which led to significant reductions in our sales and gross profits and caused the deleveraging of our selling general and administrative expenses a decline in investor interest in assetbacked securities caused us to slow caf’s share of originations in the second half of fiscal 2009 in an effort to slow the utilization of our warehouse facility 

 

longer term when economic conditions improve and we resume geographic growth we believe the principal challenges we face will include our ability to build our management bench strength to support the store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at reasonable costs we staff each newly opened store with an experienced management team therefore when we are expanding our store base we must recruit train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings 

 

fiscal 2009 highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

critical accounting policies 

 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

 

securitization transactions 

we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf the securitization transactions are accounted for as sales a gain recorded at the time of the securitization transaction results from recording a receivable equal to the present value of the residual cash flows we expect to receive over the life of the securitized receivables the fair value of our retained interest in securitization transactions includes the present value of the residual cash flows we expect to receive over the life of the securitized receivables reserve accounts an undivided ownership interest in certain receivables and retained subordinated bonds 

 

the present value of the residual cash flows we expect to receive over the life of the securitized receivables is determined by estimating the future cash flows using our assumptions of key factors such as finance charge income loss rates prepayment rates funding costs and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk these assumptions are derived from historical experience and projected economic trends adjustments to one or more of these assumptions could have a material impact on the fair value of the retained interest the fair value of the retained interest could also be affected by external factors such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers changes in the strength of the economy and developments in the interest rate and credit markets note 2c includes a discussion of accounting policies related to securitizations note 4 includes a discussion of securitizations and provides a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect on the retained interest if there were variations from the assumptions used note 6 includes a discussion on fair value measurements in addition see the “carmax auto finance income” section of this mda for a discussion of the effect of changes in our assumptions 

 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer we recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered net of a reserve for returns under our 5day moneyback guarantee a reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends and it could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

 

we also sell esps on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle because we are not the primary obligor under these service plans we recognize commission revenue on the esps at the time of sale net of a reserve for returns the reserve for esp cancellations is recorded based on historical experience and trends and it could be affected if future esp cancellations differ from historical averages 

 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted note 8 includes information regarding income taxes 

 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider available carrybacks future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation allowance recorded for a capital loss carryforward that may not be utilized before its expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 28 2009 will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

 

  

  

 

 

 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination 

 

defined benefit retirement plan 

the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note 9 plan assets which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments are valued using current market quotations plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions that we provide key assumptions used to measure the plan obligations include the discount rate the rate of compensation increases the future return on plan assets and the mortality rate in determining the discount rate we use the current yield on highquality fixedincome debt instruments that have maturities that approximate the expected timing of the anticipated benefit payments compensation increase assumptions for periods prior to december 31 2008 were based upon our historical experience and anticipated future board and management actions asset returns are estimated based upon the anticipated average yield on the plan assets effective december 31 2008 we froze the benefits under the plan and no additional benefits will accrue to participants after that date other than the effects of the plan freeze we do not believe that any significant changes in assumptions used to measure the plan obligations are likely to occur that would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

comparable store used unit sales growth is one of the key drivers of our profitability a store is included in comparable store retail sales in the store’s fourteenth full month of operation 

  

  

comparable store retail vehicle sales changes 

 

change in used car superstore base 

 

during fiscal 2009 we opened 11 used car superstores expanding our presence in 5 existing markets and opening stores in 5 new markets including huntsville alabama phoenix arizona 2 stores opened colorado springs colorado tulsa oklahoma and charleston south carolina 

 

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 our 14 decrease in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2009 resulted from the combination of an 8 decline in unit sales and a 6 decrease in average retail selling price the decline in unit sales reflected a 16 decrease in comparable store used units partially offset by sales from newer superstores not yet in the comparable store base the decrease in the average retail selling price was primarily caused by a significant industrywide drop in used car prices during the first three quarters of the year which reduced our inventory acquisition costs early in fiscal 2009 the steep increase in the cost of gasoline caused a temporary shift in consumer demand away from suvs and trucks toward more fuelefficient vehicles however in the latter half of fiscal 2009 the combination of the decline in gasoline prices and the lower more affordable prices for these less fuelefficient vehicles caused our sales mix to return to the prior year levels 

 

we began to see the initial effects of the slowdown in the automotive retail market in the latter part of fiscal 2008 however the weakness in the economy and the stresses on consumer spending accelerated in fiscal 2009 causing customer traffic to decline sharply starting in late may 2008 these stresses included rising unemployment rates decreases in home equity values and personal wealth and record low levels of consumer confidence for the year the decline in customer traffic was slightly greater than the decrease in comparable store unit sales despite the more difficult environment the solid execution by our store teams allowed us to modestly improve our conversion rate compared with fiscal 2008 while both caf and our thirdparty providers tightened lending criteria for some higherrisk customer segments lack of credit availability was not a major contributor to the reduction in sales our data for the year indicated that we modestly gained market share in the latemodel used vehicle market in fiscal 2009 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 the 12 increase in our used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 resulted from a corresponding increase in unit sales the unit sales growth reflected sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base and a 3 increase in comparable store used units this 3 increase in comparable store used units in fiscal 2008 reflected the challenging comparison with the 9 increase in fiscal 2007 as well as declining consumer confidence in the latter part of fiscal 2008 our average used vehicle selling price in fiscal 2008 was similar to the prior year as consumerdriven mix shifts from large and midsized suvs to smaller more fuelefficient vehicles in the latter half of the year offset normal price inflation 

 

  

  

 

in fiscal 2008 we experienced an overall increase in consumer traffic which we believe was a benefit of the strength of our consumer offer as well as a favorable response to improvements made to carmaxcom however compared with fiscal 2007 our sales conversion rate declined slightly as consumers appeared to be somewhat more hesitant in committing to bigticket purchases sales continued to be supported by the consistent availability of credit from caf and from thirdparty financing providers despite the deceleration in automotive industry sales our data indicated that we continued to gain share within our existing markets in fiscal 2008 in the latemodel used vehicle market 

 

new vehicle sales 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 new vehicle revenues declined 29 in fiscal 2009 the decline was the result of a 28 decrease in unit sales and a 1 decrease in average selling price new vehicle unit sales primarily reflected the extremely soft new car industry sales trends as well as the sale of our orlando chryslerjeepdodge franchise in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 for the fiscal year ended february 28 2009 new car manufacturers reported a 23 decline in us new car unit sales 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 the 17 decrease in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 was the result of a corresponding decrease in unit sales the decline in new vehicle unit sales reflected soft new car industry sales trends particularly for the domestic manufacturers that we represent and the sale of our orlando chryslerjeepdodge franchise 

 

wholesale vehicle sales 

our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering highquality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they could also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age mileage or condition of the vehicles wholesaled 

 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 the 21 decrease in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2009 resulted from a 13 decrease in wholesale unit sales combined with a 10 decrease in average wholesale selling price the decline in unit sales primarily reflected a decrease in our appraisal traffic and to a lesser extent a decline in our appraisal buy rate industry wholesale prices for suvs trucks and other less fuel efficient vehicles fell sharply in the first two quarters of fiscal 2009 and prices for virtually all vehicle classes declined at an unprecedented rate during the third quarter reflecting the weak demand environment we believe the significant drop in wholesale market values which resulted in corresponding decreases in our appraisal offers contributed to the reduction in our buy rate appraisal traffic was affected by the overall slowdown in customer traffic the decline in average wholesale selling price reflected the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 the 7 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 resulted from a 6 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 1 increase in average wholesale selling price our wholesale unit sales benefited from an increase in appraisal traffic driven by the combination of the expansion of our store base and our comparable store unit sales growth however our appraisal buy rate declined from the prior year level reflecting we believe an increasing hesitancy of consumers to commit to purchasing bigticket items 

 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of esps service department sales and net thirdparty finance fees the fixed fees paid by thirdparty finance providers vary by provider reflecting their differing levels of credit risk exposure providers who purchase the highest risk loans purchase these loans at a discount which is reflected as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the other thirdparty providers 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 other sales and revenues decreased 5 in fiscal 2009 esp revenues declined 5 compared with the 8 decrease in total used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2009 esp revenues benefited from a slow down in the rate of esp cancellations which we believe was the result of the decline in auto industry sales and tradeins thirdparty finance fees decreased 42 due to a combination of factors including the reduction in retail vehicle unit sales a shift in mix among providers and a change in discount arrangements with certain of the providers during fiscal 2009 collectively the thirdparty providers financed a larger percentage of our retail unit sales in the second half of fiscal 2009 as we chose to route more credit applications to these providers doing so allowed us to slow the use of capacity in our warehouse facility which is used to provide initial funding for substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf 

  

  

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007   other sales and revenues increased 11 in fiscal 2008 similar to the 12 increase in used vehicle unit sales

retail vehicle sales mix 

 

 

as of february 28 2009 we had a total of six new car franchises representing the chevrolet chrysler nissan and toyota brands during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold our orlando chryslerjeepdodge franchise 

during fiscal 2009 we expanded our carbuying center test with the openings in dallas texas and baltimore maryland we now have a total of five carbuying centers at which we conduct appraisals and purchase but do not sell vehicles we will continue to evaluate the performance of these five centers before deciding whether to open additional ones in future years these test sites are part of our longterm program to increase both appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing selfsufficiency equal to the percentage of vehicles sold at retail that were purchased directly from consumers 

gross profit 

 

  

  

gross profit per unit 

 

 

 

 

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not primarily based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce the exposure to the inherent continual depreciation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit we employ a volumebased strategy and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales trends inventory turns and gross profit achievement when customer traffic and sales are consistently strong we generally take fewer pricing markdowns which in turn benefits gross profit dollars per unit when the sales pace slows we may initially take more pricing markdowns which could pressure gross profit dollars per unit however as we are successful in reducing inventories to align them with a slower sales pace this may allow us to return to target levels of gross profit per unit over the past several years we have continued to refine our carbuying strategies which we believe has benefited used vehicle gross profit per unit 

 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 our used vehicle gross profit decreased by 642 million or 9 to 6444 million from 7086 million in fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of the 8 decline in total used unit sales despite the difficult sales environment in fiscal 2009 gross profit per unit decreased only 13 to 1865 per unit several factors adversely affected our fiscal 2009 used vehicle gross profit per unit including a reduction in the percent of vehicles purchased directly from customers and the sharp decrease in wholesale industry prices these were largely offset however by our success in managing our inventories 

 

during fiscal 2009 we experienced a decline in both appraisal traffic and buy rate which required us to source a larger percentage of our used vehicles at auction vehicles purchased at auction typically generate less gross profit per unit compared with vehicles purchased directly from consumers additionally wholesale industry prices for midsized and large suvs and trucks declined sharply in the spring and early summer of 2008 and this rapid decline in valuation resulted in margin pressure on this segment of inventory in the first half of fiscal 2009 

 

we believe that our ability to maintain a generally consistent level of gross profit per unit during fiscal 2009 despite the challenging sales environment and the unprecedented decline in wholesale market prices was due in large part to the effectiveness of our proprietary inventory management systems and processes in response to the sharp decline in traffic and sales that began in late may 2008 we rapidly reduced our used car inventories which brought them back in line with the current sales rates and minimized required pricing markdowns in the second half of the fiscal year compared with inventory levels at stores open as of february 29 2008 we had approximately 16500 fewer total used vehicle units in inventory as of february 28 2009 representing a 28 reduction due to the severe decline in customer traffic during fiscal 2009 we generally chose not to reduce our gross profit targets as we believed doing so in the current economic environment would not have spurred a sufficient increase in sales to offset the reduction in perunit profitability 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 our used vehicle gross profit increased by 674 million or 11 to 7086 million from 6412 million in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of the 12 increase in total used unit sales our used vehicle gross profit per unit declined 25 to 1878 per unit in fiscal 2008 the gross profit per unit increased modestly in the first half of the year before declining in the second half of the year as the economic environment continued to weaken in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we moderately reduced our gross profit targets at the beginning of the fourth quarter in an attempt to create additional value for customers and drive sales 

 

  

  

 

new vehicle gross profit 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008   our new vehicle gross profit decreased 64 million to 90 million in fiscal 2009 from 154 million in fiscal 2008 reflecting the 28 reduction in total new unit sales and a 180 decline in gross profit per unit these reductions resulted from the sharp decline in new car industry sales and the resulting increase in competitiveness in the new car market 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007   our new vehicle gross profit decreased 63 million to 154 million in fiscal 2008 from 217 million in fiscal 2007 reflecting the 17 drop in total new unit sales and a 175 decline in gross profit per unit the decline in overall consumer demand for new cars in fiscal 2008 pressured profits for many new car retailers including carmax 

 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit has steadily increased over the last several years reflecting the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our carbuying strategies appraisal delivery processes and instore auction processes we have made continuous improvements in these processes which we believe has allowed us to become more efficient our instore auctions have benefited from initiatives to increase our dealertocar ratio which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices in addition the frequency of our auctions which are generally held weekly or biweekly minimizes the depreciation risk on these vehicles 

 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 our wholesale vehicle gross profit decreased by 142 million or 8 to 1625 million in fiscal 2009 from 1767 million in fiscal 2008 the reduction was driven by the 13 decline in wholesale vehicle unit sales partially offset by an increase in wholesale gross profit per unit of 43 or 5 to 837 per unit in fiscal 2009 we experienced a record dealertocar ratio at our auctions for the year with the resulting price competition among bidders contributing to the strong wholesale gross profit per unit our wholesale vehicles are predominantly comprised of older higher mileage vehicles and we believe the demand for these types of vehicles remained strong from dealers who specialize in selling to creditchallenged customers 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased by 217 million or 14 to 1767 million in fiscal 2008 from 1550 million in fiscal 2007 the increase was attributable to the 6 increase in wholesale vehicle unit sales and an increase in wholesale gross profit per unit of 52 or 7 to 794 per unit in fiscal 2008 we continued to experience strong dealer attendance at our auctions throughout the year despite the challenging economic environment 

 

other gross profit 

other gross profit includes profits related to esp revenues thirdparty finance fees and service department sales we have no cost of sales related to either esp revenues or thirdparty finance fees as these represent commissions paid to us by the thirdparty providers accordingly changes in the mix of esp revenues and thirdparty finance fees relative to service department sales can affect the composition of other gross profit 

 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008   other gross profit decreased by 196 million or 11 to 1522 million in fiscal 2009 from 1718 million in fiscal 2008 this decrease primarily reflected the reductions in used and new retail unit sales and the related impact on esp revenues and thirdparty finance fees and a 10 decline in other gross profit per unit in fiscal 2009 the decline in other gross profit per unit was primarily associated with the increase in mix of other revenues represented by service department sales 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007   other gross profit increased by 186 million or 12 to 1718 million in fiscal 2008 from 1532 million in fiscal 2007 the increase was the result of the increase in used unit sales and the related affects on esp sales and thirdparty finance fees and a 6 increase in other gross profit per unit in fiscal 2008 the improvement in per unit profitability was the result of an increase in mix of other revenues represented by esp sales and thirdparty finance fees 

 

impact of inflation 

historically inflation has not been a significant contributor to results profitability is primarily affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than on average retail prices however increases in average vehicle selling prices benefit the sga ratio and caf income to the extent the average amount financed also increases 

 

 

 

  

  

 

in fiscal 2009 the weakness in the economy and the stresses on consumer spending contributed to the industrywide slowdown in the sale of new and used vehicles and to the unprecedented decline in wholesale market prices for most vehicle classes during the first three quarters of the year these lower wholesale values reduced our vehicle acquisition costs and contributed to the decline in our used and wholesale vehicle average selling price 

 

carmax auto finance income 

caf provides financing for a portion of our used and new car retail sales because the purchase of a vehicle is often reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers while financing can also be obtained from thirdparty sources we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk furthermore we believe that our processes and systems the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans both for caf and for the thirdparty financing providers generally caf has provided us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on thirdparty financing sources

caf originates auto loans to qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest the majority of caf income has typically been generated by the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and the related cost of funds substantially all of the loans originated by caf are sold in securitization transactions a gain recorded at the time of securitization results from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables historically the gain on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans originated and sold the “gain percentage” has generally been in the range of 35 to 45 however the gain percentage was substantially below the low end of this range in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 primarily as a result of the more challenging economic environment and the disruption in the global credit markets these factors caused us to increase the loss and discount rate assumptions that affect the gain recognized on the sale of loans and increased our funding costs 

 

 

  

  

 

gain loss on loans sold 

 

 

 

 

the gain on sales of loans originated and sold includes both the gain income recorded at the time of securitization and the effect of any subsequent changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs that are incurred in the same fiscal period that the loans were originated other losses or gains include the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous fiscal periods in addition other losses or gains could include the effects of new term securitizations changes in the valuation of retained subordinated bonds and the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing term securitizations as applicable 

 

our term securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in the pool of auto loan receivables falls below 10 of the original pool balance this option was exercised two times in each of fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 in each case the remaining eligible receivables were subsequently resold into the warehouse facility these transactions did not have a material effect on caf income in fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 in future periods the effects of refinancing repurchase or resale activity could be favorable or unfavorable depending on the securitization structure and the market conditions at the transaction date 

 

beginning in january 2008 we retained some or all of the subordinated bonds associated with our term securitizations these bonds were retained either because the economics of doing so were more favorable than selling them or because there was no market for the subordinated bonds at the applicable issue date the retained subordinated bonds which had total face values of 115 million and 447 million respectively at february 28 2009 and february 29 2008 are subject to marktomarket adjustments 

 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 caf income declined to 153 million in fiscal 2009 from 859 million in fiscal 2008 in both periods caf income was reduced by markettomarket writedowns and adjustments related to loans originated in previous fiscal years in fiscal 2009 these adjustments totaled 818 million or 023 per share and they included 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

in fiscal 2008 the adjustments totaled 96 million or 003 per share for adjustments related to loans originated and sold in previous fiscal years in fiscal 2009 caf’s gain on sales of loans originated and sold declined to 465 million compared with 581 million in fiscal 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of the reduction in caf loan originations which were adversely affected by the decreases in our used unit sales and average retail selling price in addition it reflected a decrease in the percentage of sales financed by caf resulting from our election to slow the use of capacity in our warehouse facility during the second half of fiscal 2009 the gain percentage was 24 in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 compared with the prior year the effects of using higher loss and discount rate assumptions and higher credit enhancement levels for fiscal 2009 originations were offset by the benefit of a significant drop in our funding cost benchmark rate 

 

the increases in servicing fee income and direct caf expenses in fiscal 2009 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year the interest income component of other caf income increased to 12 of average managed receivables in fiscal 2009 from 09 in fiscal 2008 primarily due to the increase in the discount rate assumption used to value the retained interest the use of a higher discount rate reduces the gain recognized at the time the loans are sold but increases the interest income recognized in subsequent periods additionally interest income includes the interest earned on the retained subordinated bonds prior to january 2008 we had not retained any subordinated bonds 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007   caf income declined to 859 million in fiscal 2008 from 1326 million in fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 caf income was reduced by 96 million or 003 per share and they included the effects of increasing the discount rate to 17 from 12 increasing cumulative net loss assumptions and a 27 million marktomarket writedown of subordinated bonds in fiscal 2007 caf income was increased by 130 million or 004 per share which included the effects of reducing cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold in previous fiscal years 

in fiscal 2008 caf’s gain on sales of loans originated and sold decreased to 581 million compared with 867 million in fiscal 2007 several factors contributed to this decrease in the second half of fiscal 2008 credit spreads in the assetbacked securitization market widened resulting in a substantial increase in caf’s funding costs in addition we increased the discount rate assumption used to calculate our gain on sales of loans to 17 in fiscal 2008 from 12 in fiscal 2007 and we increased our cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold during fiscal 2008 to a range of 27 to 30 which was significantly higher than the cumulative net loss assumptions used on loans originated in fiscal 2007 as a result the gain percentage declined to 24 in fiscal 2008 compared with 39 in fiscal 2007 

the increases in other caf income and total direct caf expenses in fiscal 2008 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year 

 

past due account information 

 

 

 

credit loss information 

 

 

 

  

  

 

we are at risk for the performance of the managed securitized receivables to the extent of our retained interest in the receivables if the managed receivables do not perform in accordance with the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the retained interest earnings could be affected our retained interest was 3483 million as of february 28 2009 compared with 2708 million as of february 29 2008 

 

in fiscal 2009 we experienced increases in both past due accounts as a percentage of ending managed receivables and net credit losses as a percentage of average managed receivables we believe these increases were primarily the result of the recession which has adversely affected unemployment and industry trends for losses and delinquencies 

 

we continually strive to refine caf’s origination strategy in order to optimize profitability and sales while managing risk historically we originated pools of loans targeted to have cumulative net loss rates in the range of 20 to 25 receivables originated in calendar years 2003 2004 and early 2005 experienced loss rates well below both caf’s historical averages and these targeted loss rates we believe this favorability was due in part to the customized credit scorecard we implemented in late 2002 as it became evident that the scorecard was resulting in lowerthanexpected loss rates caf gradually expanded its credit offers beginning in late 2004 as a result receivables originated in late 2005 and periods thereafter have experienced higher loss and delinquency rates compared with the receivables originated in these earlier years while the delinquency and projected loss rates on the more recent originations have trended higher than our initial expectations we believe this has been primarily a reflection of the worsening economic climate consequently we have increased our cumulative net loss assumptions on several recent securitizations and we have continued to incorporate similar economic stress into the projections for our most recent originations in addition we have tightened caf’s lending criteria for some applicants with higherrisk credit profiles 

 

the recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction historically the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42 to a high of 51 and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses primarily include rent and occupancy costs payroll expenses other than payroll related to reconditioning and vehicle repair service which is included in cost of sales fringe benefits advertising and other general expenses 

 

fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008   in fiscal 2009 sga expenses increased to 8824 million or 127 of total revenues from 8584 million or 105 of total revenues in fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2009 total sga expenses increased only 3 despite the 12 increase in our store base in response to the decline in sales we focused on reducing store and corporate overhead costs including payroll and advertising our total number of associates declined to 13035 as of the end of fiscal 2009 from a peak of approximately 16400 in may 2008 the fiscal 2009 sga expense also reflected reductions in growthrelated costs including preopening and relocation costs resulting from the suspension of store growth the increase in the sga ratio was mainly the result of the significant declines in comparable store used unit sales and average selling price 

 

the fiscal 2009 sga expenses included a number of nonrecurring items which in the aggregate increased the sga ratio by 22 basis points and reduced net earnings by 004 per share these nonrecurring items included severance costs associated with reduction in our service operations workforce in october 2008 costs for the termination of store site acquisitions resulting from our decision to temporarily suspend store growth and litigation costs partially offset by a benefit related to our decision to freeze our pension plan benefits as of december 31 2008 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007   in fiscal 2008 sga expenses increased to 8584 million or 105 of total revenues from 7762 million or 104 of total revenues in fiscal 2008 during fiscal 2008 total sga expenses increased 11 compared with the 16 increase in our store base during fiscal 2008 we increased our sga spending related to specific strategic operational and internet initiatives intended to improve customer satisfaction and increase efficiencies over the long term as a result our 3 increase in comparable store used unit sales in fiscal 2008 did not generate sufficient overhead leverage to offset the increases in spending related to our store growth plan and these initiatives 

 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 388 in fiscal 2009 387 in fiscal 2008 and 386 in fiscal 2007 

 

 

 

  

  

 

operations outlook 

 

store openings and capital expenditures 

we currently estimate gross capital expenditures will total approximately 20 million in fiscal 2010 compared with 1857 million in fiscal 2009 and 2531 million in fiscal 2008 this reduction reflects our decision to temporarily suspend store growth and the related reduction in both construction and land purchases for future store openings at the date we announced the suspension we had four stores under construction we opened the store in potomac mills virginia the stores in augusta georgia cincinnati ohio and dayton ohio were substantially completed at the end of fiscal 2009 but they will not be opened until market conditions improve until we resume store growth capital spending will be incurred primarily for maintenance capital items based on the relatively young average age of our store base maintenance capital has represented a very small portion of our total capital spending in recent years 

 

fiscal 2010 expectations 

as a result of the unprecedented declines in traffic and sales and the continuing volatility in the assetbacked securitization market we do not believe we can make a meaningful projection of fiscal 2010 sales or earnings however assuming that sales trends do not improve from fourth quarter fiscal 2009 levels and given all of the uncertainties in the economy we would anticipate a doubledigit decline in comparable store used unit sales in fiscal 2010 particularly early in the year 

 

recent credit spreads in the public assetbacked securitization market have been significantly higher than the spreads implicit in our warehouse facility as a result we estimate caf income will be reduced by incremental funding costs of between 60 million and 85 million before taxes or 017 to 024 per share upon refinancing the 122 billion that was funded in the warehouse facility at the end of fiscal 2009 the federal reserve launched the term assetbacked securities loan facility “talf” program in march 2009 and it will continue through december 2009 unless extended the talf program is intended to facilitate the issuance of assetbacked securities and to improve market conditions for these securities prior to the launch of this program there had been minimal new issuances of automotive assetbacked securities for several months in april 2009 we completed a term securitization totaling 10 billion of auto loan receivables which was eligible for investors to utilize the talf program 

 

absent further substantial deterioration in sales and earnings and given the assumptions set forth above we believe we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants in fiscal 2010

financial condition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities  we generated net cash from operating activities of 2646 million in fiscal 2009 795 million in fiscal 2008 and 1368 million in fiscal 2007 cash generated by operating activities was 1851 million higher in fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily reflecting the significant decrease in inventory in fiscal 2009 partially offset by the decline in net earnings despite increasing our store base by 12 we reduced inventories 28 or 2726 million in fiscal 2009 compared with an increase in inventory of 1397 million in fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2009 we dramatically reduced our used vehicle inventory levels to bring them in line with the lower sales rate in fiscal 2008 the inventory increase reflected the combination of additional inventories needed to support the expansion of our store base and the expansion of an “inventory up” test in select stores to determine whether a modest expansion of onsite vehicle inventory generally in the range of 50 to 100 cars per store would have a favorable effect on sales our retained interest in securitized receivables increased 775 million in fiscal 2009 compared with a 685 million increase in fiscal 2008 the fiscal 2009 growth reflected increases in the required excess receivables and the amount of retained subordinated bonds we hold partially offset by a decrease in interestonly strip receivables 

 

cash generated by operating activities was 573 million lower in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 the decrease resulted from a higher level of working capital investment in fiscal 2008 combined with the 166 million decrease in net earnings our retained interest in securitized receivables increased 685 million in fiscal 2008 compared with a 440 million increase 

 

  

  

 

in fiscal 2007 the fiscal 2008 increase reflected our decision to retain 447 million face value of subordinated bonds in the january 2008 term securitization and the growth in the total managed receivables inventories increased 17 or 1397 million in fiscal 2008 which was greater than our 10 increase in vehicle revenues the growth in inventories resulted from the increase in our store base and from the “inventory up” test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 this test was being conducted in approximately 30 of our stores 

 

the aggregate principal amount of outstanding auto loan receivables funded through securitizations which are discussed in notes 3 and 4 totaled 383 billion as of february 28 2009 376 billion as of february 29 2008 and 324 billion as of february 28 2007 during fiscal 2009 we completed two term securitizations of auto loan receivables including 750 million in may 2008 and 525 million in july 2008 we retained a total of 703 million face value of subordinated bonds in these two securitizations during fiscal 2008 we completed three term securitizations funding a total of 178 billion of auto loan receivables in the term securitization in january 2008 we retained 447 million face value of subordinated bonds 

 

as of february 28 2009 the warehouse facility limit was 14 billion at that date 122 billion of auto loan receivables were funded in the warehouse facility and unused warehouse capacity totaled 185 million as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 the warehouse facility limit had been temporarily increased to 13 billion from 10 billion during fiscal 2009 we increased the facility limit to 14 billion the warehouse facility has an annual term and it expires in july 2009 we intend to enter into new or renew or expand existing funding arrangements to meet caf’s future funding needs however based on conditions in the credit markets the cost and credit enhancements for these arrangements could be materially higher than historical levels and the timing and capacity of these transactions could be dictated by market availability rather than our requirements note 4 includes additional discussion of the warehouse facility 

 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 1553 million in fiscal 2009 2570 million in fiscal 2008 and 1872 million in fiscal 2007 capital expenditures were 1857 million in fiscal 2009 2531 million in fiscal 2008 and 1918 million in fiscal 2007 in addition to store construction costs capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 included the cost of land acquired for future year store openings the decline in capital spending in fiscal 2009 reflected our decision in december 2008 to temporarily suspend store growth 

 

historically capital expenditures have been funded with internally generated funds longterm debt and saleleaseback transactions net proceeds from the sales of assets totaled 343 million in fiscal 2009 11 million in fiscal 2008 and 46 million in fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2009 we completed saleleaseback transactions for our two used car superstores in austin texas valued at 313 million 

 

as of february 28 2009 we owned our home office in richmond virginia 41 used car superstores currently in operation and the three superstores that have been substantially completed but which will not be opened until market conditions improve in addition five superstores were accounted for as capital leases 

 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled 184 million in fiscal 2009 1710 million in fiscal 2008 and 481 million in fiscal 2007 during the second half of fiscal 2009 due to the unprecedented conditions in the credit markets we believed that it was prudent to maintain a higherthannormal cash balance as of february 28 2009 we had cash and cash equivalents of 1406 million compared with 130 million as of february 29 2008 and 195 million as of february 28 2007 despite the increase in cash and the decline in earnings in fiscal 2009 total debt increased by only 78 million to 3370 million as of february 28 2009 primarily due to our significant reductions in inventory in fiscal 2008 we increased total debt by 1489 million primarily to fund increased inventory and capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 we used cash generated from operations to reduce total debt by 95 million 

 

during fiscal 2009 we increased the aggregate borrowing limit under our revolving credit facility by 200 million to a total of 700 million the credit facility expires in december 2011 and is secured by our vehicle inventory borrowings under this credit facility are limited to 80 of qualifying inventory and they are available for working capital and general corporate purposes as of february 28 2009 3085 million was outstanding under the credit facility and 2277 million of the remaining balance was available to us the outstanding balance under the facility included 09 million classified as shortterm debt 1576 million classified as current portion of longterm debt and 1500 million classified as longterm debt we classified 1576 million of the outstanding balance as of february 29 2008 as current portion of longterm debt based on our expectation that this balance will not remain outstanding for more than one year 

 

  

  

 

cash received on equity issuances which primarily related to employee stock option exercises was 102 million in fiscal 2009 147 million in fiscal 2008 and 354 million in fiscal 2007 the fiscal 2007 receipts included exercises by the former chief executive officer in connection with his retirement and other exercises prompted by the significant increase in our stock price during that fiscal year 

 

we expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements saleleaseback transactions and borrowings under existing or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future 

 

fair value measurements on march 1 2008 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas 157” sfas 157 defines fair value and is applied in any situation where an asset or liability is measured at fair value under existing us generally accepted accounting principles in accordance with sfas 157 we reported money market securities retained interest in securitized receivables and financial derivatives at fair value as these financial assets were already reported at fair value the implementation of sfas 157 did not have a material impact on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition see note 6 for more information on the adoption and application of this standard 

 

the retained interest in securitized receivables was valued at 3483 million as of february 28 2009 and 2708 million as of february 29 2008 included in the retained interest were interestonly strip receivables various reserve accounts and required excess receivables totaling 2609 million and 2277 million respectively as of these dates in addition the retained interest included retained subordinated bonds with a total fair value of 874 million as of february 28 2009 and 431 million as of february 29 2008 

 

as described in note 4 we use discounted cash flow models to measure the fair value of the retained interest excluding the retained subordinated bonds in addition to funding costs and prepayment rates the estimates of future cash flows are based on certain key assumptions such as finance charge income loss rates and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk both of which are significant unobservable inputs changes in these inputs could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

in measuring the fair value of the retained subordinated bonds we use a widely accepted thirdparty bond pricing model our key assumption is determined based on current market spread quotes from thirdparty investment banks and is currently a significant unobservable input changes in this input could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

 

during fiscal 2009 changes were made to certain key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the retained interest see the carmax auto finance income section of mda for a discussion of the effects of these changes 

 

as the key assumptions used in measuring the fair value of the retained interest including the retained subordinated bonds are significant unobservable inputs the retained interest is classified as a level 3 asset in accordance with the sfas 157 hierarchy as of february 28 2009 the retained interest represented 690 of the total assets measured at fair value as disclosed in note 6

offbalance sheet arrangements 

caf provides financing for a portion of our used and new car retail sales we use a revolving securitization program “warehouse facility” to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf until they can be funded through a term securitization or alternative funding arrangement we sell the auto loan receivables to a wholly owned bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that transfers an undivided interest in the receivables to entities formed by thirdparty investors 

 

historically we have used term securitizations to refinance the receivables previously securitized through the warehouse facility the purpose of term securitizations is to provide permanent funding for these receivables in these transactions a pool of auto loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose securitization trust 

 

additional information regarding the nature business purposes and importance of our offbalance sheet arrangement to our liquidity and capital resources can be found in the carmax auto finance income financial condition and market risk sections of mda as well as in notes 3 and 4 

 

 

 

  

  

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

auto loan receivables 

as of february 28 2009 and february 29 2008 all loans in our portfolio of auto loan receivables were fixedrate installment loans financing for these auto loan receivables was achieved through asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and floatingrate securities we manage the interest rate exposure relating to floatingrate securitizations through the use of interest rate swaps disruptions in the credit markets could impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies receivables held for investment or sale are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with financial derivatives are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments notes 5 and 6 provide additional information on financial derivatives 

 

composition of auto loan receivables 

 

 

 

 

 

interest rate exposure 

 

we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt substantially all of our debt is floatingrate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2009 net earnings per share by 001

we were the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality used vehicles at competitively low “nohaggle” prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility the carmax consumer offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers and it is structured around four customer benefits low nohaggle prices a broad selection high quality vehicles and a customerfriendly sales process our strategy is to better serve the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems 

 

 

 

 

we purchase recondition and sell used vehicles all of the used vehicles we retail are thoroughly reconditioned to meet high mechanical electrical safety and cosmetic standards and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale approximately 85 of the used vehicles we retail are 1 to 6 years old with fewer than 60000 miles we also offer a selection of used vehicles at each superstore that are more than 6 years old or have more than 60000 miles if they meet similar quality standards 

 

we also sell new vehicles at five locations under franchise agreements with four new car manufacturers chrysler general motors nissan and toyota in fiscal 2008 new vehicles comprised 4 of our total retail vehicle unit sales as planned new car sales have become an increasingly smaller part of our business mix over the past several years as we have divested 15 new car franchises while we focused on growing our used car business 

 

we provide customers with a full range of related products and services including the financing of vehicle purchases through carmax auto finance “caf” our own finance operation and thirdparty financing providers the sale of extended service plans and accessories the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers and vehicle repair service 

 

the carmax consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options terms and associated prices of each component the customer can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer our nohaggle pricing and our commission structure which is generally based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard allow sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

 

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make an offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us we acquire the majority of our retail used vehicle inventory through this unique instore appraisal process we also acquire a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory through wholesale auctions and to a lesser extent directly from other sources including wholesalers dealers and fleet owners vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through onsite wholesale auctions 

 

our inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process using the information provided by this system and applying sophisticated statistical modeling techniques we are able to optimize our inventory mix anticipate future inventory needs at each store evaluate sales consultant and buyer performance and refine our vehicle pricing strategy because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and pricing system more than 99 of the entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

 

industry and competition with calendar year 2007 sales of approximately 340 billion used vehicles comprise nearly half of the us auto retail market the largest retail segment of the economy in calendar 2007 there were an estimated 414 million used vehicles sold in the us compared with approximately 162 million new vehicles latemodel vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old our primary focus are estimated at approximately 275 billion in annual sales and 19 million units per year 

 

the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive and includes approximately 21500 franchised new car dealers and 43000 independent used car dealers as well as millions of private individuals our primary competitors are the franchised new car dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles independent used car dealers predominantly sell older higher mileage cars than we do competition has been affected by the increasing use of internetbased marketing for both used vehicles and vehicle financing in both the used and new vehicle markets we seek to distinguish ourselves from traditional dealerships through our consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies 

 

we believe that our principal competitive factors in used vehicle retailing are our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience our competitively low prices our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available both on site and via our website carmaxcom the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems and the locations of our retail stores upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfers are free within a market longer distance transfers include a charge to cover transportation costs in fiscal 2008 more than 20 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request our certified quality inspection assures that every vehicle we offer for sale meets stringent mechanical electrical and safety standards we back every vehicle with a 5day moneyback 

 

 

guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty other competitive factors include our ability to offer or arrange customer financing with competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of the extended service plans we offer we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas and that we enjoy advantages over competitors that employ traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques 

 

our sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid a commission based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the gross margin on the vehicle being sold the sales consultant normally receives no commission on the finance process this ensures that the sales consultant’s primary objective is helping customers find the right vehicles for their needs at prices they can afford in contrast sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships typically receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates and for steering customers toward vehicles with higher gross margins 

 

in the new vehicle market we compete with other franchised dealers historically the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional automotive selling methods we believe our customerfriendly lowpressure sales methods are points of competitive differentiation 

 

marketing and advertising our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle we use market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor our marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area our marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts carmaxcom the internet and newspaper advertising television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer newspaper advertisements promote our broad selection of vehicles and price competitiveness targeting consumers with immediate purchase intentions broadcast internet and newspaper advertisements are designed to drive customers to our stores and to carmaxcom 

 

we have changed our marketing programs in response to the rapidly changing media landscape we have customized our marketing program based on awareness levels in each market in many markets we have expanded the use of internetbased advertising while curtailing the use of newspaper advertising we are building awareness and driving traffic to our stores and carmaxcom by listing every retail vehicle on both autotradercom and carscom through their syndicated networks autotradercom and carscom vehicle listings appear on sites that we believe are visited by a majority of buyers of latemodel used vehicles who use the internet in their shopping process our advertising on the internet also includes banner and keyword advertisements on search engines such as google and yahoo 

 

our website carmaxcom is a marketing tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online the website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on the more than 25000 cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated daily carmaxcom includes detailed information such as vehicle photos prices features specifications and store locations as well as advanced featurebased search capabilities and sorting and comparison tools that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and an option to estimate tradein values via a link to kelley blue book customers can contact sales consultants online via carmaxcom by telephone or by fax customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home including applying for financing and need to visit the store only to sign the paperwork and pay for and pick up their vehicle our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2008 more than 60 of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had visited our website first 

 

suppliers for used vehicles we acquire used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our instore appraisal process and through other sources including local and regional auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies in calendar 2007 approximately 21 million used vehicles were remarketed in the us of which nearly 10 million were sold at wholesale auction 

 

the majority of our used vehicle inventory is acquired directly from consumers through our appraisal process the most popular makes and models are more readily available directly from consumers than from other sources this buying strategy also helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the tastes of each market in fiscal 2007 we began testing a standalone carbuying center in atlanta georgia our goal for the carbuying center was to increase appraisal traffic and generate incremental vehicle purchases from 

 

 

individual consumers we expanded this test in fiscal 2008 opening two additional carbuying centers in raleigh north carolina and tampa florida and we plan to open two more centers during fiscal 2009 

 

we have replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which a carmaxtrained buyer appraises a customer’s vehicle and provides the owner with a written guaranteed offer that is good for seven days   an appraisal is available to every customer free of charge whether or not the customer purchases a vehicle from us based on their age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this instore appraisal process meet our high quality retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through onsite wholesale auctions 

 

the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers who handle both onsite appraisals and offsite auction purchases our buyers evaluate all used vehicles on the basis of their estimated wholesale market value as well as estimated reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases transportation costs our buyers in collaboration with our home office staff utilize the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system to decide which inventory to purchase at offsite auctions our inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross profit per unit 

 

based on consumer acceptance of the instore appraisal process our experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current needs and to support planned expansion 

 

suppliers for new vehicles our new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales service and dealer agreements among other things these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies a manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances including a change in ownership without prior manufacturer approval failure to maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings or a material breach of other provisions of the agreement in addition to selling new vehicles using our low nohaggle price strategy the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow us to perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 

 

seasonality our business is seasonal most of our superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically lowest in the fall quarter which coincides with the new vehicle modelyearchangeover period in the fall the new model year introductions and discounts on model year closeouts generally can cause rapid depreciation in used car pricing particularly for latemodel used cars customer traffic also tends to slow in the fall as the weather changes and as customers shift their spending priorities toward holidayrelated expenditures seasonal patterns for car buying and selling may vary in different parts of the country and as we expand geographically these differences could have an effect on the overall seasonal pattern of our results 

 

products and services 

merchandising we offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices our used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as chrysler ford general motors honda hyundai mazda mitsubishi nissan subaru toyota and volkswagen and luxury brands such as acura bmw infiniti lexus and mercedes our primary focus is vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old have fewer than 60000 miles and generally range in price from 11000 to 30000 for the more costconscious consumer we also offer used cars that are more than 6 years old or have 60000 miles or more and that generally range in price from 7500 to 21000 

 

we have implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which we set nohaggle prices on both our used and new vehicles we believe that our pricing is competitive with the bestnegotiated prices in the market prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom autotradercom and carscom and where applicable in our newspaper advertising we extend our nohaggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction including vehicle appraisal offers financing rates accessories extended service plan pricing and vehicle documentation fees 

 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process this process includes a comprehensive certified quality inspection of the engine and all major systems including cooling fuel drivetrain transmission electronics suspension brakes steering air conditioning and other equipment as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle based on this quality inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our high quality standards our service technicians complete vehicle inspections   we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services we engage third parties specializing in those services over the past several years we have performed an increasing percentage of reconditioning services inhouse and based on the cost savings realized we expect this trend to continue nonproduction formerly referred to as satellite superstores depend upon nearby production formerly referred to as mega and standard superstores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead 

 

all carmax used car superstores provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by our extended service plans we also provide factoryauthorized service at all new car franchises we have developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that our retail repair service is conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as our other operations 

 

we believe that the efficiency of our reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by our modern facilities a technician mentoring process and our information systems the mentoring process and our compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of technicians identify opportunities for cost reduction and achieve highquality repairs our information systems provide the ability to track repair history and enable trend analysis which serves as guidance for our continuous improvement efforts 

 

wholesale auctions vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions as of february 29 2008 wholesale auctions were conducted at 49 of our 89 superstores auctions are generally held at production superstores on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned which depends on the number of stores and the market awareness of the company and our instore appraisal offer in that market the typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers to participate in a carmax auction dealers must register with our centralized auction support group at which time we determine the purchase limit available to each dealer we make conditional announcements on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions the average auction sales rate was 97 in fiscal 2008 dealers pay a fee to the company based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase 

 

customer credit   we offer customers a wide range of financing alternatives which we believe enhances the carmax consumer offer before the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed more than 40 of our retail vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2008 customer credit applications are initially reviewed by caf and may also be reviewed by a thirdparty provider customers who are not approved by either caf or the initial thirdparty provider are evaluated by other lenders having a wide array of financing sources not only expands the choices for our customers but also increases discrete approvals to this end we have tested and will continue to test other thirdparty lenders 

customers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through our proprietary information system a majority of applicants receive a response within five minutes the vehicle financings are retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles financed for the majority of loans arranged by the thirdparty providers we are paid a fee per vehicle financed we have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty providers customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their loans within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges 

 

extended service plans at the time of the sale we offer the customer an extended service plan we sell these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors under the thirdparty service plan programs we have no contractual liability to the customer the extended service plans have terms of coverage from 12 to 72 months depending on the vehicle mileage make and age we offer extended service plans at low fixed prices which are based primarily on the repair record of the vehicle make and model and the length of coverage selected all extended service plans that we sell other than manufacturers’ warranties have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements under which we receive a commission from the administrator at the time the extended service plan is sold in fiscal 2008 more than 

 

 

half of the customers purchasing a used vehicle from carmax also purchased an extended service plan 

 

our extended service plan customers have access to vehicle repair service at each carmax store and to the thirdparty administrators’ nationwide network of approximately 14000 independent service providers we believe that the quality of the services provided by this network as well as the broad scope of our extended service plans helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

 

systems 

our stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions using instore information kiosks customers can search each store’s vehicle inventory and print a detailed listing for any vehicle which includes the vehicle’s features and specifications and a map showing its specific location on the display lot our inventory management system tracks every vehicle through its life from purchase through reconditioning and testdrives to ultimate sale bar codes are placed on each vehicle and on each parking space on the display lot and all vehicle bar codes are scanned daily as a loss prevention measure testdrive information is captured on every vehicle using radio frequency identification devices linking the specific vehicle and the sales consultant we also capture data on vehicles we wholesale which helps us track market pricing an online finance application process and computerassisted document preparation ensure rapid completion of the sales transaction behind the scenes our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about every aspect of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity in addition our store system provides a direct link to our proprietary credit processing information system to facilitate the credit review and approval process 

 

our inventory management and pricing system allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each superstore this system also generates recommended retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on complex algorithms that take into account factors including sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which minimizes the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit 

 

in addition to inventory management our electronic repair order system “ero” is used by the service department to sequence reconditioning procedures ero provides information that helps increase quality and reduce costs which further enhances our customer service and profitability 

 

through our centralized systems we are able to immediately integrate new stores into our store network allowing the new stores to rapidly achieve operating efficiency we continue to enhance and refine our information systems which we believe to be a core competitive advantage the design of our information systems incorporates offsite backups redundant processing and other measures to reduce the risk of significant data loss in the event of an emergency or disaster 

 

associates 

on february 29 2008 we had a total of 15637 associates including 11780 hourly and salaried associates and 3857 sales associates who worked on a commission basis sales consultants include both fulltime and parttime employees we employ additional associates during peak selling seasons as of february 29 2008 our location general managers averaged more than eight years of carmax experience in addition to prior retail management experience we open new stores with experienced management teams drawn from existing stores

training to further support our emphasis on attracting developing and retaining qualified associates we have made a commitment to providing exceptional training programs on average each store associate completed at least 15 online or classroom courses totaling more than 75 hours of training per associate in fiscal 2008 store associates receive structured selfpaced training that introduces them to company policies and their specific job responsibilities through kmx university – our proprietary intranetbased testing and tracking 

 

 

system kmx university is comprised of customized applications hosted within a learning management system that allow us to author deliver and track training events and to measure associate competency before and after training in fiscal 2008 more than one million hours of training were delivered through kmx university most new store associates are also assigned mentors who provide onthejob guidance and support 

 

we also provide comprehensive facilitatorled classroom training courses to sales consultants buyers automotive technicians and managers all sales consultants receive extensive customer service training both initially and on an ongoing basis buyersintraining undergo a 6 to 18month apprenticeship under the supervision of experienced buyers and they generally will assist with the appraisal of more than 1000 cars before making their first independent purchase we utilize a mix of internal and external technical training programs in an effort to provide a stable future supply of qualified technicians reconditioning and mechanical technicians attend inhouse and vendorsponsored training programs designed to develop their skills in performing repairs on the diverse makes and models of vehicles we sell technicians at our new car franchises also attend manufacturersponsored training programs to stay abreast of current diagnostic repair and maintenance techniques for those manufacturers’ vehicles additionally our management training program includes rotations through each functional area

 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to various risks including the risks described below our business results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known or that we currently deem immaterial 

economic conditions   in the normal course of business we are subject to changes in general or regional us economic conditions including but not limited to consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates interest rates gasoline prices inflation personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general any significant changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer demand andor increase costs 

capital changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the availability and cost of longterm financing to support our geographic expansion and the availability and cost of financing auto loan receivables could adversely affect growth and operating strategies further our current credit facility and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants andor performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants andor performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we use and have historically relied upon a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf initially we sell these receivables into our warehouse facility we periodically refinance the receivables through public securitizations if there were a change in the condition of the assetbacked market we could incur higher costs to access funds in this market or we could be required to seek alternative means to finance our loan originations in the event that this market ceased to exist and there were no immediate alternative funding sources available we might be forced to curtail our lending practices for some period of time the impact of reducing or curtailing caf’s loan originations could have a material adverse impact on our business sales and results of operations 

competition   automotive retailing is a highly competitive business our competition includes publicly and privately owned new and used car dealers as well as millions of private individuals competitors could sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices further new entrants to the market could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected vehicle sales and margins competition could be affected by the increasing use of internetbased marketing for both used vehicles and vehicle financing customers are increasingly using the internet to compare pricing for cars and related financing which could further reduce sales and adversely affect our results of operations in addition caf is subject to competition from various financial institutions 

retail prices any significant changes in retail prices for used and new vehicles could reduce sales and profits if any of our competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices for used or new vehicles we would likely reduce our prices in order to remain competitive which could result in a decrease in our sales revenue and results of operations and require a change in our operating strategies 

inventory a reduction in the availability or access to sources of inventory would adversely affect our business a failure to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with broader market tradein offer trends or a failure to recognize those trends could negatively impact the ability to acquire inventory should we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate the excess inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs would adversely affect our results of operations 

regulatory environment we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as licensing requirements and laws regarding advertising vehicle sales financing and employment practices our facilities and business operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety the violation of these laws or regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a cease and desist order against business operations as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs to comply with these laws and regulations further over the past several years private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased their scrutiny of advertising sales financing and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced 

management and workforce our success depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition we will need to hire additional personnel as we open new stores the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate is highly competitive and could result in increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 

information systems our business is dependent upon the efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales inventory consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain and continually enhance or protect the integrity of these systems could disrupt our business operations impact sales and results of operations expose us to customer or thirdparty claims or result in adverse publicity 

accounting policies and matters we have identified several accounting policies as being “critical” to the fair presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our business and require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain materially different amounts could be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions the implementation of new accounting requirements or changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could adversely affect our reported results of operations or financial condition potential changes currently under consideration by the financial accounting standards board include but are not limited to proposed rule changes relating to the accounting for securitization transactions and potential changes in accounting for leases and pension expense 

confidential customer information   in the normal course of business we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of thirdparty service providers could be vulnerable to security breaches acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming or human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information whether by us or by thirdparty service providers could damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability disrupt our business or otherwise harm our results of operations 

litigation we are subject to various litigation matters which if the outcomes in any significant matters are adverse could adversely affect our business claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct business 

real estate the inability to acquire or lease suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit the expansion of our store base and could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations 

weather the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes or other natural disasters could cause store closures adversely affecting consumer traffic and could adversely affect our results of operations 

seasonal fluctuations our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters these conditions could have a disproportionately large adverse effect on annual results of operations 

geographic concentration our   performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large number of our superstores are located in the southeastern us and in the chicago los angeles and washington dcbaltimore markets our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experienced a downturn in economic conditions it could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

other material events the occurrence of certain material events including natural disasters acts of terrorism the outbreak of war or other significant national or international events could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 2 properties 

 

we conduct our used vehicle operations in two basic retail formats – production and nonproduction superstores production superstores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed while nonproduction superstores do not perform vehicle reconditioning production superstores are generally 40000 to 60000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres but a few formerly referred to as mega superstores range from approximately 70000 to 95000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres nonproduction superstores are generally 10000 to 20000 square feet on 4 to 10 acres 

 

stores as of february 29 2008 

 

 

 

 

we have financed the majority of our stores through saleleaseback transactions as of february 29 2008 we leased 60 of our 92 retail stores and owned the remaining 32 stores we also own our home office building in richmond virginia and land associated with planned future store openings 

 

expansion 

we believe that we are well positioned to succeed in the highly competitive automotive retail industry we have built a strong foundation for future growth based upon our unique knowledge of the used car market established presence in key locations and ability to execute our business plan in a market subject to continuous change we continue to refine our operating strategies and have grown to be the nation’s largest retailer of used cars 

 

 

specifically we have enhanced our ability to identify profitable markets and determine the appropriate store formats to fit those markets 

 

we plan to open superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15 of our used car superstore base in fiscal 2009 we plan to open approximately 14 superstores including 7 production superstores and 7 nonproduction superstores expanding our store base by 16 our fiscal 2009 expansion plans are largely focused on opening production superstores in new midsized markets and nonproduction superstores in existing markets we generally define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations of between 600000 and 25 million people historically midsized markets have been the easiest to enter from a real estate and an advertisingawareness building perspective and they are where we have generally experienced the fastest rampup in store sales and profitability we also have resumed store growth in new large markets

 it em 3 legal proceedings 

 

on june 12 2007 ms regina hankins filed a putative class action lawsuit against carmax inc in baltimore county circuit court maryland we operate five stores in the state of maryland the plaintiff alleges that since may 25 2004 carmax has not properly disclosed its vehicles’ prior rental history if any the plaintiff seeks compensatory damages punitive damages injunctive relief and the recovery of attorneys’ fees at this time we continue to evaluate the allegations and our defenses we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in this matter 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business based upon our evaluation of information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect either individually or in the aggregate on our financial condition or results of operations

business overview 

 

general 

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we pioneered the used car superstore concept opening our first store in 1993 our strategy is to better serve the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems as of february 29 2008 we operated 89 used car superstores in 41 markets comprised of 30 midsized markets 10 large markets and 1 small market we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000 and 25 million people we also operated six new car franchises all of which were integrated or colocated with our used car superstores in fiscal 2008 we sold 377244 used cars representing 96 of the total 392729 vehicles we sold at retail 

 

we believe the carmax consumer offer is distinctive within the automobile retailing marketplace our offer provides customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for other items at other big box retailers our consumer offer is structured around our four customer benefits low nohaggle prices a broad selection high quality vehicles and a customerfriendly sales process our website carmaxcom is a valuable tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer a sophisticated search engine and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct their shopping online we generate revenues income and cash flows primarily by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing extended service plans “esps” and vehicle repair service a majority of the used vehicles we sell at retail are purchased directly from consumers 

 

we also generate revenues income and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards these vehicles are sold through onsite wholesale auctions wholesale auctions are held on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis and as of february 29 2008 we conducted auctions at 49 used car superstores during fiscal 2008 we sold 222406 wholesale vehicles on average the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers 

 

carmax provides financing to qualified customers through carmax auto finance “caf” our finance operation and a number of other thirdparty financing providers we collect fixed prenegotiated fees from the majority of the thirdparty providers and we periodically test additional providers carmax has no recourse liability for the financing provided by these third parties 

 

we sell esps on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors we have no contractual liability to the customer under these thirdparty service plans extended service plan revenue represents commissions from the unrelated third parties 

 

we are still at a relatively early stage in the national rollout of our retail concept and as of february 29 2008 we had used car superstores located in markets that comprised approximately 43 of the us population we currently plan to open used car superstores at a rate of approximately 15 of our used car superstore base each year over the long term we expect comparable store used unit sales increases to average in the range of 4 to 8 reflecting the multiyear ramp in sales at newly opened stores as they mature continued market share gains at stores that have reached basic maturity sales levels and underlying industry sales growth we estimate that our stores generally reach basic maturity sales levels in their fifth year of operation 

 

 

while total gross profit per unit has gradually increased over the last several years we believe the primary driver for future earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from both new stores and from stores included in our comparable store base we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not based on the vehicle’s selling price 

 

the principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to build our management bench strength to support the store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at reasonable costs we staff each newly opened store with an experienced management team we must therefore continually recruit train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings if at any time we believed that the rate of store growth was causing our performance to falter we would consider slowing the growth rate 

 

fiscal 2008 highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

 

 

securitization transactions 

we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf the securitization transactions are accounted for as sales a gain recorded at the time of the securitization transaction results from recording a receivable equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables the fair value of our retained interest in securitization transactions includes the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables cash reserve accounts an undivided ownership interest in certain receivables and retained subordinated bonds 

 

the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables is determined by estimating the future cash flows using management’s assumptions of key factors such as finance charge and fee income cost of funds loss rates prepayment rates and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk these assumptions are derived from historical experience and projected economic trends adjustments to one or more of these assumptions may have a material impact on the fair value of the retained interest the fair value of the retained interest may also be affected by external factors such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers changes in the economy and developments in the interest rate and credit markets note 2c includes a discussion of accounting policies related to securitizations note 4 includes a discussion of securitizations and provides a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect on the retained interest if there were variations from the assumptions used in addition see the “carmax auto finance income” section of this mda for a discussion of the effect of changes in our assumptions 

 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer we recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered net of a reserve for returns under our 5day moneyback guarantee a reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends and it could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

 

we also sell esps on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle because these third parties are the primary obligors under these programs we recognize commission revenue on the esps at the time of the sale net of a reserve for returns the reserve for esp returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends and it could be affected if future esp returns differ from historical averages 

 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted note 7 includes information regarding income taxes 

 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income except for a valuation allowance recorded for a capital loss carryforward that may not be utilized before its expiration we believe that our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 29 2008 will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination 

 

 

 

 

defined benefit retirement plan 

the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note 8 plan assets which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments are valued using current market quotations plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions that we provide key assumptions used to measure the plan obligations include the discount rate the estimated rate of salary increases the estimated future return on plan assets and the mortality rate in determining the discount rate we use the current yield on highquality fixedincome investments that have maturities corresponding to the timing of the benefit payments salary increase assumptions are based upon our historical experience and anticipated future board and management actions asset returns are estimated based upon the anticipated average yield on the plan assets we do not believe that any significant changes in assumptions used to measure the plan obligations are likely to occur that would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

 

results of operations 

 

net sales and operating revenues 

 

retail vehicle sales changes 

 

comparable store used unit sales growth is one of the key drivers of our profitability a store is included in comparable store retail sales in the store’s fourteenth full month of operation 

comparable store retail vehicle sales changes 

 

change in used car superstore base 

 

during fiscal 2008 we opened 12 used car superstores expanding our presence in 5 existing large and midsized markets and opening stores in 5 new markets including tucson arizona milwaukee wisconsin san diego california omaha nebraska and jackson mississippi 

 

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 the 12 increase in our used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 resulted from a corresponding increase in unit sales the unit sales growth reflected sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base and a 3 increase in comparable store used units this lowerthannormal level of comparable store used unit growth reflected the combination of the nearterm decline in consumer confidence and a slowing sales pace for the automotive retail industry as well as the challenging comparison with our 9 increase during fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 we experienced an overall increase in consumer traffic which we believe benefited from the strength of our consumer offer as well as the favorable response to the improvements made to carmaxcom however compared with fiscal 2007 our sales conversion rate declined slightly as consumers appeared to be somewhat more hesitant in committing to bigticket purchases our average used vehicle selling price in fiscal 2008 was similar to the prior year reflecting consumerdriven mix shifts from large and midsized suvs to smaller more fuelefficient vehicles 

 

sales were supported by the continued consistent availability of credit from caf and from thirdparty financing providers despite the deceleration in automotive industry sales our data indicated that we continued to gain share within our existing markets in the latemodel used vehicle market 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 the 23 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 resulted from a 16 increase in unit sales and a 6 increase in average selling price the unit sales growth reflected a 9 increase in comparable store used units together with sales from newer superstores not yet included in the comparable store base our comparable store used unit sales growth benefited from strong store and internet traffic and continued strong execution by our store teams the increase in the average retail selling price was primarily the result of a shift in vehicle mix as we experienced a resurgence in the sales of suvs and trucks which we believe had been adversely affected in the prior year by consumer reaction to higher gasoline prices the increase in average retail selling price also reflected growth in the percentage of luxury vehicles in our sales mix 

 

sales financed by the thirdparty subprime financing provider declined to less than 1 of our used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2007 from approximately 3 in fiscal 2006 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 this provider implemented program changes in certain states narrowing the selection of vehicles it would finance and making this business less economically attractive to us we chose to curtail our business with this provider in these states to preserve margins and profits this decline in subprimefinanced sales in fiscal 2007 was substantially offset however by incremental sales financed by additional providers added to the group of thirdparty lenders in the second half of fiscal 2006 

 

new vehicle sales 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 the 17 decrease in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 was the result of a corresponding decrease in unit sales the decline in new vehicle unit sales reflected soft new car industry sales trends particularly for the domestic manufacturers that we represent and the sale of our orlando chryslerjeepdodge franchise in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 

 

 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 the 11 decrease in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 was substantially the result of decreases in unit sales and in part reflected our strategic decision in fiscal 2007 to increase targeted gross profit dollars per unit on new vehicles we had anticipated that this decision would result in some reduction in new vehicle unit sales the decline in new vehicle unit sales also reflected the effects of reduced industry new car sales for several of the brands we represent including chevrolet chrysler and nissan 

 

wholesale vehicle sales 

our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering highquality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold through onsite wholesale auctions 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 the 7 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2008 resulted from a 6 increase in wholesale unit sales combined with a 1 increase in average wholesale selling price compared with the prior year while appraisal traffic increased we experienced a decline in our buy rate our wholesale auction prices usually reflect the trends in the general wholesale market for the types of vehicles we sell although they may also be affected by changes in vehicle mix or the average age miles or condition of the vehicles wholesaled 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 the 18 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 resulted from a 16 increase in wholesale unit sales and a 1 increase in average wholesale selling price our wholesale unit sales benefited from a substantial increase in appraisal traffic primarily spurred by our strong comparable store unit sales growth and the expansion of our store base in the first half of fiscal 2007 our average wholesale selling price climbed 6 reflecting we believe the residual effects of industry shortages of older highermileage vehicles experienced following hurricanes katrina rita and wilma in the fall of 2005 in the second half of fiscal 2007 our average wholesale selling price was 4 below the prior year level reflecting the challenging comparison with the previous year 

 

other sales and revenues 

other sales and revenues include commissions on the sale of esps service department sales and thirdparty finance fees the fixed fees paid by thirdparty financing providers vary by provider reflecting their differing levels of credit risk exposure we record the discount at which the subprime provider purchases loans as an offset to finance fee revenues received from the other providers 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 other sales and revenues increased 11 in fiscal 2008 similar to the 12 increase in used vehicle unit sales 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   other sales and revenues increased 10 in fiscal 2007 the increase was primarily the result of increased sales of esps and an increase in thirdparty finance fees the increase in esp sales was consistent with our increase in used vehicle unit sales the thirdparty finance fees increased nearly 50 in fiscal 2007 benefiting from the decline in sales financed by the subprime provider service department sales declined modestly in fiscal 2007 as the reconditioning activities required to support our strong comparable store used vehicle sales growth limited the service capacity available for customer pay work

retail vehicle sales mix 

 

 

retail stores 

 

 

as of february 29 2008 we had a total of six new car franchises representing the chevrolet chrysler nissan and toyota brands two franchises are integrated within used car superstores and the remaining four franchises are operated from three facilities that are colocated with select used car superstores during the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we sold our orlando chryslerjeepdodge franchise 

during fiscal 2008 we expanded our carbuying center test with the opening of buying centers in raleigh north carolina and tampa florida expanding the test we began in atlanta georgia in fiscal 2007 at these three locations we conduct appraisals and purchase but do not sell vehicles these test centers are part of our longterm plan to increase both appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing selfsufficiency 

gross profit 

 

 

 

 

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a dollar range of gross profit per used unit sold the gross profit dollar target for an individual vehicle is based on a variety of factors including its anticipated probability of sale and its mileage relative to its age however it is not based on the vehicle’s selling price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce the exposure to the inherent continual depreciation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage gross profit dollars per unit we employ a volumebased strategy and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales growth inventory turns and gross profit achievement when customer traffic and sales are consistently strong we generally take fewer pricing markdowns which in turn benefits gross profit dollars per unit conversely when the sales pace slows we generally take more pricing 

 

 

markdowns which may pressure gross profit dollars per unit over the past several years we have continued to refine our carbuying strategies which we believe has benefited used vehicle gross profit per unit 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 our used vehicle gross profit declined 25 per unit in fiscal 2008 the gross profit per unit increased modestly in the first half of the year before declining in the second half of the year as the economic environment continued to weaken in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we moderately reduced our margin targets at the beginning of the fourth quarter in order to create additional value for customers and drive sales this was consistent with our longterm strategy to deliver a superior customer experience and grow market share 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 our used vehicle gross profit increased 95 per unit in fiscal 2007 this increase reflected the benefit of our strong consistent sales performance throughout the year we believe several external factors contributed to a greater degree of sales volatility in the prior year including significant changes in gasoline prices new vehicle incentives and interest rates we did not experience similar variability in these external factors in fiscal 2007 and therefore benefited from a more stable business environment in addition our used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2006 was adversely affected by slowing demand for suvs and trucks that have lower gas mileage which resulted in higher pricing markdowns for these vehicles 

 

new vehicle gross profit 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007   our new vehicle gross profit decreased 175 per unit in fiscal 2008 the decline in overall consumer demand for new cars in fiscal 2008 pressured profits for many new car retailers including carmax 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   our new vehicle gross profit increased 235 per unit in fiscal 2007 the increase primarily reflected our strategic decision to increase targeted new vehicle gross profit dollars per unit in fiscal 2007 while this decision contributed to a reduction in new vehicle unit sales it resulted in an increase in the total gross profit contribution from new vehicles 

 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

our wholesale vehicle profitability has steadily increased over the last several years reflecting the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our carbuying strategies appraisal delivery processes and instore auction processes we have made continuous improvements in these processes which we believe has allowed us to become more efficient our instore auctions have benefited from initiatives to increase average dealer attendance which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 52 per unit in fiscal 2008 we continued to experience strong dealer attendance at our auctions throughout the year despite the challenging economic environment 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 42 per unit in fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of ongoing initiatives to improve our carbuying and auction processes 

 

other gross profit 

we have no cost of sales related to either extended service plan revenues or thirdparty finance fees as these represent commissions paid to us by the thirdparty providers accordingly changes in the mix of extended service plan revenues and thirdparty finance fees relative to service department sales can affect other gross profit 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007   other gross profit increased 6 per unit in fiscal 2008 the improvement was the result of the growth in esp sales and thirdparty finance fees partially offset by a small reduction in service department margins 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   other gross profit increased 40 per unit in fiscal 2007 the improvement was the result of the growth in esp sales and thirdparty finance fees and an increase in service department margins our service department reported higher profits in fiscal 2007 as our strong comparable store used unit sales growth increased our ability to leverage total service and reconditioning overhead expenses 

 

impact of inflation 

inflation has not been a significant contributor to results profitability is affected by our ability to achieve targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than on average retail prices however increases in average vehicle selling prices will benefit the sga ratio and caf income to the extent the average amount financed also increases 

 

carmax auto finance income 

caf provides financing for our used and new car sales because the purchase of a vehicle is traditionally reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers while financing can also be obtained from thirdparty sources we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk furthermore we believe that our processes and systems the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure high quality auto loans both for caf and for the thirdparty financing providers caf provides us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on thirdparty financing sources 

 

components of caf income 

 

percent columns indicate 

 

 

 

caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs or income we present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefit or costs that could be attributed to caf examples of indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources administrative services marketing information systems accounting legal treasury and executive payroll 

caf originates auto loans to qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest the majority of caf income is generated by the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and the related cost of funds substantially all of the loans originated by caf are sold in securitization transactions a gain recorded at the time of securitization results from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables in a normalized environment we expect the gain on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans originated and sold the “gain percentage” to be in the range of 35 to 45 

 

 

 

gain income and loans sold 

 

 

 

 

the gain on sales of loans originated and sold includes both the gain income recorded at the time of securitization and the effect of any subsequent changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs that are incurred in the same fiscal year that the loans were originated other losses or gains include the effects of changes in valuation assumptions or funding costs related to loans originated and sold during previous fiscal years in addition other losses or gains could include the effects of new public securitizations changes in the valuation of retained subordinated bonds and the resale of receivables in existing public securitizations as applicable in the 20081 public securitization we held 447 million of subordinated bonds because the economics of doing so were more favorable than selling them in the public market 

 

our public securitizations typically contain an option to repurchase the securitized receivables when the outstanding balance in the pool of auto loan receivables falls below 10 of the original pool balance this option was exercised two times in each of fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 in each case the remaining eligible receivables were subsequently resold into the warehouse facility these transactions did not have a material effect on caf income in fiscal 2008 2007 or 2006 

 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007   caf income declined 35 to 859 million in fiscal 2008 reflecting the disruption in the global credit markets and worsening economic conditions the gain on sales of loans originated and sold decreased 33 to 581 million in fiscal 2008 in the second half of the fiscal year credit spreads in the assetbacked securities market widened resulting in a substantial increase in caf’s funding costs in addition we increased the discount rate assumption used to calculate our gain on sales of loans to 17 from 12 and we increased our cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold during fiscal 2008 to a range of 27 to 30 which was significantly higher than the cumulative net loss assumptions used on loans originated in fiscal 2007 as a result the gain percentage declined to 24 in fiscal 2008 compared with 39 in fiscal 2007 

we recognized other losses of 96 million or 003 per share in fiscal 2008 which included the effects of the increase in the discount rate and cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold in previous years other losses also included a 27 million reduction in the carrying value of the retained subordinated bonds in fiscal 2007 we recognized other gains of 130 million or 004 per share which included the effects of reducing cumulative net loss assumptions on loans originated and sold in previous years 

the increases in other caf income and other direct caf expenses in fiscal 2008 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   caf income rose 27 to 1326 million in fiscal 2007 caf income benefited from the growth in retail vehicle unit sales increases in the gain percentage average amount financed and total managed receivables the gain percentage increased to 39 in fiscal 2007 from 35 in fiscal 2006 reflecting changes in the 

 

 

interest rate environment in fiscal 2006 our funding costs were rising faster than rates charged to consumers resulting in a lower gain percentage in fiscal 2007 the relative stability in our funding cost allowed us to achieve a higher gain percentage 

 

we recognized other gains of 130 million or 004 per share in fiscal 2007 compared with 152 million or 004 per share in fiscal 2006 in both years the majority of the other gains resulted from reductions in our cumulative net loss assumptions related to receivables originated in prior fiscal years 

 

the increases in other caf income and other direct caf expenses in fiscal 2007 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year 

 

past due account information 

 

 

credit loss information 

 

 

we are at risk for the performance of the managed securitized receivables to the extent of our retained interest in the receivables if the managed receivables do not perform in accordance with the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the retained interest earnings could be affected 

 

in fiscal 2008 we experienced increases in both past due accounts as a percentage of total managed receivables and net credit losses as a percentage of average managed receivables compared with the previous fiscal year we believe these increases were the result of a combination of factors including the prior expansion of our credit offers and the less favorable general economic and industry trends for losses and delinquencies 

 

we continually strive to refine caf’s origination strategy in order to optimize profitability and sales while controlling risk in general we originate pools of loans targeted to have cumulative net loss rates in the range of 20 to 25 receivables originated in calendar years 2003 2004 and early 2005 have experienced loss rates well below both caf’s historical averages and these targeted loss rates we believe this favorability was due in part to the credit scorecard we implemented in late 2002 as it became evident that the scorecard was resulting in lowerthanexpected loss rates caf gradually expanded its credit offers beginning in late 2004 as a result receivables originated in late 2005 and in 2006 and 2007 have been experiencing higher loss and delinquency rates compared with the receivables originated in these earlier years while the delinquency and projected loss rates on the more recent originations were higher than our initial expectations we believe this was primarily related to the worsening economic climate consequently we increased our cumulative net loss assumptions on the 2007 and 2008 public securitizations and we incorporated similar economic stress into the projections for our most recent originations 

 

the recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction historically the annual recovery rate has ranged from a low of 42 to a high of 51 and it is primarily affected by changes in the wholesale market pricing environment 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007   the sga ratio increased to 105 from 104 in fiscal 2007 during fiscal 2008 we increased our sga spending related to specific strategic operational and internet initiatives intended to improve customer satisfaction and increase efficiencies over the long term as a result our 3 increase in comparable store used unit sales in fiscal 2008 did not generate sufficient overhead leverage to offset the increases in spending related to our ongoing growth plan and these initiatives 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   the sga ratio declined to 104 from 108 in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2007 we benefited from the leverage of fixed expenses generated by our strong comparable store sales growth the improvement in the fiscal 2007 sga ratio was partially offset by an increase in sharebased compensation costs due to the accelerated vesting of stock options upon the retirement of our former chief executive officer and by the recognition of an impairment loss totaling 49 million or 001 per share the impairment loss related to the write down of intangible assets associated with one of our new car franchises which was subsequently sold 

 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 387 in fiscal 2008 386 in fiscal 2007 and 383 in fiscal 2006 

 

operations outlook 

 

store openings and capital expenditures 

during the fiscal year ending february 28 2009 we plan to expand our used car superstore base by approximately 16 opening an estimated 14 used car superstores including 7 production and 7 nonproduction stores 

 

fiscal 2009 planned superstore openings 

 

 

 

we expect to enter eight new markets and expand our presence in five existing markets in fiscal 2009 we currently expect to open approximately nine superstores in the first half of fiscal 2009 and five superstores in the second half of the fiscal year however normal construction permitting or other scheduling delays could shift opening dates of any stores into a later period 

 

in fiscal 2009 we also plan to open a central reconditioning facility in the washington dc  baltimore market where we currently have six superstores we have experienced strong sales growth in this market and this facility will support additional expected market share gains in addition we are converting our nonproduction store in ontario california to a production store with the addition of reconditioning facilities which will support our continued growth in the los angeles market 

 

 

in fiscal 2009 we also plan to expand our carbuying center test with the opening of our fourth and fifth centers in dallas texas opened april 2008 and in baltimore maryland we will continue to evaluate the performance of these five centers before deciding whether to open additional centers in future years 

 

we currently estimate gross capital expenditures will total approximately 350 million in fiscal 2009 planned expenditures primarily relate to new store construction and land purchases associated with future year store openings as well as the reconditioning capacity expansions compared with the 253 million spent in fiscal 2008 the fiscal 2009 capital spending estimate reflects an increase in land purchases to support future year store openings and the increase in the number of stores planned to be opened

fiscal 2009 sales we currently anticipate the change in comparable store used unit sales in the range of 2 to 5 in fiscal 2009 the wide range reflects an expectation of continued softness in the economy and volatility in the market for latemodel used cars we expect total revenues to increase between 7 and 14 reflecting our planned new store openings the comparable store sales performance and anticipated declines in both used vehicle average selling prices and new car revenues 

 

we are not anticipating any material change in credit availability for our customers in fiscal 2009 despite the fact that americredit corp is no longer one of our thirdparty financing providers effective april 1 2008 we anticipate the majority of loans previously financed by americredit will be financed by other thirdparty providers 

 

fiscal 2009 earnings per share we currently expect fiscal 2009 earnings per share in the range of 078 to 094 the width of this range reflects the uncertainty of current market conditions especially in the credit markets we expect to maintain our used and wholesale gross profit dollars per unit at levels similar to those in fiscal 2008 

 

we currently believe the caf gain percentage on loans originated and sold in fiscal 2009 could be well below the normalized range of 35 to 45 reflecting the continued use of a 17 discount rate in calculating the gain on loans sold and our expectations that funding costs and cumulative net loss rates will remain at higherthannormal levels due to the stresses of the current economy 

 

we are anticipating that the disruption in the credit markets will continue to adversely affect caf income throughout fiscal 2009 relative to historical norms in addition based on the funding cost spreads achieved in recent comparable public securitizations we estimate that caf will have to absorb approximately 14 million of incremental funding costs upon the refinancing of the 855 million that was outstanding in the warehouse facility to the end of fiscal 2008 

 

our fiscal 2009 earnings estimates also reflect an expected increase in our sga ratio the combination of the anticipated comparable store sales performance and the decline in used vehicle average selling prices together with continued investments supporting our growth plan will likely cause the sga ratio to increase in fiscal 2009 

 

we expect average outstanding debt will rise in fiscal 2009 which will increase our interest expense the higher debt levels primarily relate to planned capital spending as well as the prospect of continuing to retain some subordinated bonds in connection with future caf securitizations

financial condition 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities  we generated net cash from operating activities of 795 million in fiscal 2008 1368 million in fiscal 2007 and 1175 million in fiscal 2006 cash generated by operating activities was 573 million lower in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 the decrease resulted from a higher level of working capital investment in fiscal 2008 combined with the 166 million decrease in net earnings our retained interest in securitized receivables increased by 685 million in fiscal 2008 reflecting our decision to retain the 447 million 

 

 

face value of caf subordinated bonds in the 20081 public securitization and the growth in the total managed receivables inventories increased by 17 or 1397 million in fiscal 2008 which was higher than our 10 increase in vehicle revenues the growth in inventories resulted from the increase in our store base and from a test underway in fiscal 2008 to determine whether increasing onsite vehicle inventory by approximately 50 to 100 cars per store would favorably affect sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 this test was being conducted in approximately 30 of our stores we plan to continue this test in fiscal 2009 

 

cash generated from operating activities was 193 million higher in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 the 644 million increase in net earnings in fiscal 2007 was more than offset by the increased growth in inventories inventories increased 1664 million in fiscal 2007 compared with a 931 million increase in fiscal 2006 the fiscal 2007 inventory increase related to store openings during fiscal 2007 and shortly after the end of the fiscal year as well as to added vehicle inventory required to support our strong increase in fourth quarter comparable store used unit sales 

 

the aggregate principal amount of outstanding auto loan receivables funded through securitizations which are discussed in notes 3 and 4 totaled 376 billion as of february 29 2008 324 billion as of february 28 2007 and 271 billion as of february 28 2006 during fiscal 2008 we completed three public securitizations of auto loan receivables funding a total of 178 billion of auto loan receivables in the 20081 public securitization we held 447 million face value of subordinated bonds 

 

as of february 29 2008 the warehouse facility limit was 13 billion and unused warehouse capacity totaled 4455 million the warehouse facility limit was 825 million at the beginning of fiscal 2008 and it was increased to 10 billion at its annual renewal in july 2007 in response to the growth in our business in december 2007 we arranged a temporary 300 million increase in the warehouse facility capacity to 13 billion through april 2008 in order to provide additional funding flexibility the warehouse facility matures in july 2008 and we anticipate that we will be able to renew expand or enter into new securitizations or other funding arrangements to meet caf’s future funding needs note 4 includes additional discussion of the warehouse facility 

 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 2570 million in fiscal 2008 1872 million in fiscal 2007 and 1161 million in fiscal 2006 capital expenditures were 2531 million in fiscal 2008 1918 million in fiscal 2007 and 1944 million in fiscal 2006 in addition to store construction costs capital expenditures for all three years included the cost of land acquired for future year store openings in fiscal 2006 capital expenditures also included costs associated with our new home office which was completed in october 2005 

 

historically capital expenditures have been funded with internally generated funds short and longterm debt and saleleaseback transactions net proceeds from the sales of assets totaled 11 million in fiscal 2008 46 million in fiscal 2007 and 783 million in fiscal 2006 the majority of the sale proceeds in fiscal 2006 related to saleleaseback transactions in fiscal 2006 we entered into saleleaseback transactions involving five superstores valued at 727 million these transactions were structured with initial lease terms of either 15 or 20 years with four fiveyear renewal options as of february 29 2008 we owned 32 superstores currently in operation as well as our home office in richmond virginia in addition five superstores were accounted for as capital leases 

 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was 1710 million in fiscal 2008 481 million in fiscal 2007 and 32 million in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2008 we increased total debt by 1489 million primarily to fund increased inventory and capital expenditures we used cash generated from operations to reduce total debt by 95 million in fiscal 2007 and 68 million in fiscal 2006 

 

we have a 500 million revolving credit facility which is available until december 2011 borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and are secured by our vehicle inventory which was 9758 million at the end of fiscal 2008 as of february 29 2008 3002 million was outstanding under the credit facility with the remainder fully available to us the outstanding balance included 210 million classified as shortterm debt 792 million classified as current portion of longterm debt and 2000 million classified as longterm debt we classified 792 million of the outstanding balance as of february 29 2008 as current portion of longterm debt based on our expectation that this balance will not remain outstanding for more than one year 

 

cash received on equity issuances which primarily related to employee stock option exercises was 147 million in fiscal 2008 354 million in fiscal 2007 and 60 million in fiscal 2006 the increase in fiscal 2007 reflected exercises by the former chief executive officer in connection with his retirement and other exercises prompted by the significant increase 

 

 

in our stock price during that fiscal year 

 

we expect that cash generated by operations and proceeds from securitization transactions or other funding arrangements saleleaseback transactions and borrowings under existing or expanded credit facilities will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future 

 

contractual obligations 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

caf provides financing for our used and new car sales we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the auto loan receivables originated by caf we sell the auto loan receivables to a wholly owned bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that transfers an undivided interest in the receivables to a group of thirdparty investors this program is referred to as the warehouse facility 

 

we periodically use public securitizations to refinance the receivables previously securitized through the warehouse facility in a public securitization a pool of auto loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose securitization trust 

 

additional information regarding the nature business purposes and importance of our offbalance sheet arrangement to our liquidity and capital resources can be found in the carmax auto finance income financial condition and market risk sections of this mda as well as in notes 3 and 4 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

auto loan receivables 

as of february 29 2008 and february 28 2007 all loans in our portfolio of auto loan receivables were fixedrate installment loans financing for these auto loan receivables was achieved through asset securitization programs that in turn issued both fixed and floatingrate securities we manage the interest rate exposure relating to floatingrate securitizations through the use of interest rate swaps disruptions in the credit markets may impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies receivables held for investment or sale are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however they could have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

 

 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with financial derivatives are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments note 5 provides additional information on financial derivatives 

 

composition of auto loan receivables 

 

 

 

 

interest rate exposure 

 

we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt substantially all of our debt is floatingrate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2008 net earnings per share by less than 001

 item 1 business 

 

business overview 

carmax background carmax inc was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 carmax inc is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries our home office is located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond va 

 

under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first carmax superstore in richmond va in 1997 circuit city completed the initial public offering of a tracking stock circuit city stores inccarmax group common stock which was intended to track separately the performance of the carmax operations on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction becoming an independent separately traded public company 

 

carmax business we are the nation’s largest retailer of used cars based on the 337021 used vehicles we retailed during the fiscal year ended february 28 2007 as of the end of fiscal 2007 we operated 77 used car superstores in 36 metropolitan markets in addition we sold 208959 wholesale vehicles in fiscal 2007 through our onsite auctions 

 

we were the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality used vehicles at competitively low fixed prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility the carmax consumer offer provides our customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers and it is structured around four core equities low nohaggle prices a broad selection high quality and customerfriendly service our strategy is to better serve the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of customer dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies through the use of standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems 

 

 

we purchase recondition and sell used vehicles all of the used vehicles we retail are thoroughly reconditioned to meet high mechanical electrical safety and cosmetic standards and each vehicle must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale approximately 85 of the used vehicles we retail are one to six years old with fewer than 60000 miles we also offer a selection of used vehicles at each superstore that are more than six years old or have more than 60000 miles but which meet similar quality standards 

 

we also sell new vehicles at seven locations under franchise agreements with four new car manufacturers in fiscal 2007 new vehicles comprised 5 of our total retail vehicle unit sales as planned new car sales have become a smaller part of our business mix over the past several fiscal years as we have divested 14 new car franchises while aggressively growing our used car business we may divest additional new car franchises in the future 

 

we provide our customers with a full range of related products and services including the financing of vehicle purchases through carmax auto finance “caf” our own finance operation and thirdparty lenders the sale of extended service plans and accessories the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers and vehicle repair service 

 

the carmax consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options terms and associated prices of each component the customer can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer  our “nohaggle” pricing and our commission structure which is based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard allow our sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

 

we have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions we will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make an offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us we acquire the majority of our retail used vehicle inventory through this unique instore appraisal process we also acquire a significant portion of our used vehicle inventory through wholesale auctions and to a lesser extent directly from other sources including wholesalers dealers and fleet owners those vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold at onsite wholesale auctions 

 

our inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process using the information provided by this system and applying sophisticated statistical modeling techniques we are able to optimize our inventory mix anticipate future inventory needs at each store evaluate sales consultant and buyer performance and refine our vehicle pricing strategy because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and pricing system more than 99 of the entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

 

industry and competition with calendar year 2006 sales of approximately 340 billion used vehicles comprise nearly half of the us auto retail market the largest retail segment of the economy in calendar 2006 there were an estimated 426 million used vehicles sold in the us compared with approximately 166 million new vehicles our primary focus latemodel vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old are estimated at approximately 290 billion in annual sales and 20 million units per year 

 

the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive and includes approximately 21800 franchised new car dealers and 44000 independent dealers as well as millions of private individuals our primary competitors are the franchised new car dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles independent dealers predominantly sell older higher mileage cars than we do in both the used and new vehicle markets we seek to distinguish ourselves from traditional dealerships through our consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies 

 

we believe that our principal competitive factors in used vehicle retailing are our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience our competitively low prices our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available both on site and via our website carmaxcom the quality of our vehicles our proprietary information systems and the location of our retail stores upon request by a customer we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfers are free within a market longer distance transfers include a charge to cover transportation costs in fiscal 2007 more than 20 of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request our certified quality inspection assures that every vehicle we offer for sale meets stringent mechanical electrical and safety standards we back every vehicle with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty other competitive factors include our ability to offer 

 

 

 

or arrange customer financing on competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of the extended service plans we offer we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas and that we enjoy advantages over competitors that employ traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques 

 

our sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid a commission based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the price or gross margin on the vehicle being sold the sales consultant receives no commission on the finance process this en sures that the sales consultant’s primary objective is helping customers find the right vehicles for their needs at prices they can afford in contrast sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships often receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and for steering customers toward vehicles with higher gross margins 

 

in the new vehicle market we compete with other franchised dealers offering vehicles produced by the same or other manufacturers historically the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional automotive selling methods we believe our customerfriendly lowpressure sales methods are points of competitive differentiation 

 

marketing and advertising our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle we use market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor our marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area our marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts carmaxcom the internet and newspaper advertising television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer newspaper advertisements promote our broad selection of vehicles and price competitiveness targeting consumers with immediate purchase intentions broadcast internet and newspaper advertisements are designed to drive customers to our stores and to carmaxcom 

 

the media landscape is changing rapidly and we are changing our marketing programs in response we are customizing our marketing program based on awareness levels in each market in selected markets we have expanded our use of internetbased advertising while curtailing our use of newspaper advertising we are building awareness and driving traffic to our stores and carmaxcom by listing every retail vehicle on both autotradercom and carscom through their syndicated networks autotradercom and carscom vehicle listings appear on sites that we believe are visited by a majority of late model used vehicle buyers who use the internet in their shopping process our advertising on the internet also includes banner and keyword advertisements on search engines such as google and yahoo 

 

our website carmaxcom is a marketing tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online the website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on the more than 25000 cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated daily carmaxcom includes detailed information such as vehicle photos prices features specifications and store locations as well as sorting and comparison features that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and an option to estimate tradein values via a link with kelley blue book customers can contact sales consultants online via carmaxcom by telephone or by fax customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home including applying for financing and need to visit the store only to sign the paperwork and pick up their vehicle 

 

suppliers for used vehicles we acquire our used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our unique instore appraisal process and through other sources including local and regional auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies in calendar 2006 approximately 22 million used vehicles were remarketed in the us of which nearly 10 million were sold at wholesale auction 

 

the majority of our used vehicle inventory is acquired directly from consumers through our appraisal process the most popular makes and models are more readily available directly from consumers than from other sources this buying strategy also helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the tastes of each market in may 2006 we began testing a standalone car buying center in the atlanta market our goal for the car buying center is 

 

 

 

to increase appraisal traffic and generate incremental vehicle purchases from individual consumers we plan to expand this test by opening three additional car buying centers in fiscal 2008 

 

we have replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which a carmaxtrained buyer appraises the vehicle and provides the vehicle’s owner with a written guaranteed offer that is good for 7 days   an appraisal is available to every customer free of charge whether or not the individual purchases a vehicle from us based on their age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this instore appraisal process meet our high quality retail standards those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold at our onsite wholesale auctions 

 

the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers who handle both onsite appraisals and offsite auction purchases our buyers evaluate all used vehicles on the basis of their estimated wholesale value and reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases cost of delivery to the store where they will be reconditioned to decide which inventory to purchase at offsite auctions our buyers in collaboration with our home office staff rely on the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system our inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross margin dollars per unit 

 

based on consumer acceptance of the instore appraisal process at existing carmax stores our experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to our needs we believe that our sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet current needs and to support planned expansion 

 

suppliers for new vehicles our new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales service and dealer agreements with daimlerchrysler general motors nissan and toyota among other things these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies a manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances including a change in ownership without prior manufacturer approval failure to maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings or a material breach of other provisions of the agreement in addition to selling new vehicles using our low nohaggle price strategy the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow us to perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 

 

seasonality our business is seasonal most of our superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer quarters sales are typically lowest in the fall quarter which coincides with the new vehicle modelyearchangeover period in the fall the new model year introductions and discounts on model year closeouts generally can cause rapid depreciation in used car pricing particularly for latemodel used cars customer traffic also tends to slow in the fall as the weather gets colder and as customers shift their spending priorities toward holidayrelated expenditures seasonal patterns for car buying and selling may vary in different parts of the country and as we expand geographically these differences could have an effect on the overall seasonal pattern of our results 

 

products and services 

merchandising we offer our customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices our used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler ford general motors honda hyundai mazda mitsubishi nissan subaru toyota and volkswagen and luxury brands such as acura bmw infiniti lexus and mercedes our primary focus is vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old have fewer than 60000 miles and generally range in price from 11500 to 30000 for the more costconscious consumer we also offer used cars that are more than 6 years old or have 60000 miles or more and that generally range in price from 8000 to 22000   

 

we have implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which we set nohaggle prices on both our used and new vehicles we believe that our pricing is competitive with the bestnegotiated prices in the market prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom autotradercom and carscom and where applicable in our newspaper advertising we extend our nohaggle philosophy to every component of 

 

 

 

the vehicle transaction including vehicle appraisal offers  financing rates accessories extended service plan pricing and vehicle documentation fees 

 

reconditioning and service an integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process this process includes a comprehensive certified quality inspection of the engine and all major systems including cooling fuel drivetrain transmission electronics suspension brakes steering air conditioning and other equipment as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle based on this quality inspection we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our high quality standards our service technicians complete vehicle inspections   we perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services we engage third parties specializing in those services over the past several years we have performed an increasing percentage of reconditioning services inhouse and based on the cost savings realized we expect this trend to continue satellite superstores depend upon nearby mega or standard superstores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead 

 

all carmax used car locations provide vehicle repair service including repairs of vehicles covered by our extended service plans we also provide factoryauthorized service at all new car franchises we have developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that our retail repair service is conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as our other operations 

 

we believe that the efficiency of our reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by our modern facilities a technician mentoring process and our information systems the mentoring process and compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of technicians identify opportunities for cost reduction and achieve highquality repairs our information systems provide the ability to track repair history and enable trend analysis which serves as guidance for our continuous improvement efforts 

 

wholesale auctions vehicles purchased through our instore appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards are sold at onsite wholesale auctions at february 28 2007 wholesale auctions were conducted at 46 of our 77 superstores auctions are generally not held at satellite superstores auctions are held on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned which depends on the number of stores and the market awareness of the company and our instore appraisal offer in that market the typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers to participate in a carmax auction dealers must register with our centralized auction support group at which time we determine the purchase limit available to each dealer we make conditional announcements on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles salvage history and unknown true mileage professional licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions these policies result in an auction sales rate that is generally between 95 and 100 dealers pay a fee to the company based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase 

 

customer credit we offer our customers a wide range of financing alternatives which we believe enhances the carmax consumer offer before the effect of 3day payoffs and vehicle returns caf financed more than 40 of our used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2007 customer credit applications are initially reviewed by caf and may also be reviewed by bank of america customers who are not approved by either caf or bank of america are evaluated by our core secondtier finance partners including americredit financial services capital one auto finance citifinancial auto and wells fargo auto finance customers who are not approved by any of these finance partners are evaluated by our thirdtier lenders which include triad financial and drive financial services drive having a wide array of lenders not only expands the choices for our customers but also increases discrete approvals to this end we have tested and will continue to test other thirdparty finance companies 

customers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through   our proprietary information system   responses from caf and bank of america are generally received in less than five minutes the vehicle financings or loans are retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles financed we have no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty finance companies customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their loans within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges our arrangements with our primary and secondtier thirdparty finance companies generally provide for payment of a fee to carmax at the time of financing provided the loan is not paid in full within 90 days drive purchases customer loans at a discount 

 

 

 

extended service plan sales at the time of the sale we offer the customer an extended service plan we sell these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors under the thirdparty service plan programs we have no contractual liability to the customer the extended service plans have terms of coverage from 12 to 72 months depending on the vehicle age and make we offer these extended service plans at low fixed prices which are based primarily on the repair record of the vehicle and the length of coverage selected all extended service plans that we sell other than manufacturers’ warranties have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements under which we receive a commission from the administrator at the time the extended service plan is sold in fiscal 2007 more than half of the customers purchasing a used vehicle from carmax also purchased an extended service plan 

 

our extended service plan customers have access to our vehicle repair service at each carmax store and to the thirdparty administrators’ nationwide network of approximately 14000 independent service providers we believe that the quality of the services provided by this network as well as the broad scope of our extended service plans helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

 

systems 

our stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions using instore information kiosks customers can search each store’s vehicle inventory and print a detailed listing for any vehicle which includes the vehicle’s features and specifications and a map showing its specific location on the display lot our inventory management system tracks every vehicle through its life from purchase through reconditioning and testdrives to ultimate sale bar codes are placed on each vehicle and on each parking space on the display lot and all vehicle bar codes are scanned daily as a loss prevention measure test drive information is captured on every vehicle using radio frequency identification devices linking the specific vehicle and the sales consultant we also capture data on vehicles we wholesale which helps us track market pricing an online finance application process and computerassisted document preparation ensure rapid completion of the sales transaction behind the scenes our proprietary store technology provides our management with realtime information about every aspect of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity 

 

our inventory management and pricing system allows us to buy the mix of makes models age mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each superstore this system also generates recommended retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on complex algorithms that take into account factors including sales history consumer interest and seasonal patterns we believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns which minimizes the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit 

 

in addition to inventory management our electronic repair order system “ero” is used by the service department to sequence reconditioning procedures ero provides information that helps increase quality and reduce costs which further enhances our customer service and profitability 

 

through our centralized systems we are able to immediately integrate new stores into our store network allowing the new stores to rapidly achieve operating efficiency we continue to enhance and refine our information systems which we believe to be a core competitive advantage the design of our information systems incorporates offsite backups redundant processing and other measures to reduce the risk of significant data loss in the event of an emergency or disaster 

 

associates 

on february 28 2007 we had a total of 13736 employees including 10394 hourly and salaried associates and 3342 sales associates who worked on a commission basis sales associates include both fulltime and parttime employees we employ additional associates during peak selling seasons at february 28 2007 our location general managers averaged more than 8 years of carmax experience in addition to prior retail management experience management believes that the company maintains good employee relations no carmax associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement

 item 1a risk factors 

 

we are subject to various risks including the risks described below our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks additional risks not presently known or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair the business and our operations 

economic conditions   in the normal course of business we are subject to changes in general or regional us economic conditions including but not limited to consumer credit availability consumer credit delinquency and loss rates interest rates gasoline prices inflation personal discretionary spending levels and consumer sentiment about the economy in general any significant changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer demand andor increase costs resulting in lower profitability for the company 

competition   automotive retailing is a highly competitive business our competition includes publicly and privately owned franchised new car dealers and independent dealers as well as millions of private individuals our competitors may sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that we offer in the same or similar markets at competitive prices further new entrants to the market could result in increased acquisition costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected vehicle sales and margins caf is subject to competition from various financial institutions additionally competition on vehicle sales and related financing is increasing as these products are now being marketed and sold over the internet customers are increasingly using the internet to compare pricing for cars and related financing which may further reduce our profitability 

retail prices any significant changes in retail prices for used and new vehicles could reduce our sales and margins if any of our competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices for used or new vehicles we would likely reduce our prices in order to remain competitive which could result in a decrease in our sales and profitability and require a change in our operating strategies 

inventory a reduction in the availability or access to sources of inventory would adversely affect our business a failure to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with the broader market tradein offer trends or a failure to recognize those trends could negatively impact our ability to acquire inventory should we develop excess inventory the inability to liquidate the excess inventory at prices that allow us to meet margin targets or to recover our costs would adversely affect our profitability 

real estate the inability to acquire suitable real estate at favorable terms could limit the expansion of our store base and could have a material adverse affect on our future operating results 

management and workforce   our success depends upon the continued contributions of our store region and corporate management teams consequently the loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in addition we will need to hire additional personnel as we open new stores the market for qualified employees in the industry and in the regions in which we operate is highly competitive and may result in increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment 

information systems our business is dependent upon the efficient operation of our information systems in particular we rely on our information systems to effectively manage sales inventory consumer financing and customer information the failure of these systems to perform as designed or the failure to maintain and continually enhance or protect the integrity of these systems could disrupt our business impact sales and profitability or expose us to customer or thirdparty claims 

capital changes in the availability or cost of capital and working capital financing including the availability of longterm financing to support our geographic expansion and the availability of securitization financing could adversely affect growth and operating strategies further our current credit facility and certain securitization and saleleaseback agreements contain covenants andor performance triggers any failure to comply with these covenants andor performance triggers could have a material adverse effect on our business 

weather the occurrence of severe weather events such as rain snow wind storms hurricanes or other natural disasters adversely affecting consumer traffic at our superstores could negatively impact our operating results 

 

seasonal fluctuations   our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations we generally realize a higher proportion of revenue and operating profit during the first and second fiscal quarters if conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first or second fiscal quarters the adverse effect on our revenues and operating profit for the year could be disproportionately large 

geographic concentration our   performance is subject to local economic competitive and other conditions prevailing in geographic areas where we operate since a large number of our superstores are located in the southeastern us and in the chicago los angeles houston dallas and washington dcbaltimore markets our results of operations depend substantially on general economic conditions and consumer spending habits in these markets in the event that any of these geographic areas experience a downturn in economic conditions it could adversely affect our business 

regulatory environment   we are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements and laws regarding advertising vehicle sales financing and employment practices  our facilities and operations are also subject to federal state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety the violation of these laws and regulations could result in administrative civil or criminal penalties or in a cease and desist order against operations as a result we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with these laws and regulations further over the past several years private plaintiffs and federal state and local regulatory and law enforcement authorities have increased their scrutiny of advertising sales and finance and insurance activities in the sale and leasing of motor vehicles if as a result other automotive retailers adopt more transparent consumeroriented business practices our differentiation versus those retailers could be reduced 

litigation we are subject to various litigation matters which if the outcomes in any significant matters are adverse could negatively affect our business claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us by individuals either individually or through class actions or by governmental entities in civil or criminal investigations and proceedings these actions could expose us to adverse publicity and to substantial monetary damages and legal defense costs injunctive relief and criminal and civil fines and penalties including suspension or revocation of licenses to conduct operations 

accounting matters the implementation of new accounting requirements or changes to us generally accepted accounting principles could adversely affect our reported financial position or results of operations potential changes currently under consideration by the financial accounting standards board include but are not limited to proposed rule changes relating to the accounting for securitization transactions and potential changes in accounting for leases and pension expense 

other material events the occurrence of certain material events including natural disasters acts of terrorism the outbreak of war or other significant national or international events could adversely affect our results

we conduct our used vehicle operations in three basic retail formats  mega standard and satellite superstores our current growth plan primarily includes the construction of standard superstores and satellite superstores standard superstores are generally 40000 to 60000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres satellite superstores are generally 10000 to 20000 square feet on 4 to 10 acres mega superstores are approximately 70000 to 95000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres 

 

stores as of february 28 2007   

 

 

 

 

we have financed the majority of our stores through saleleaseback transactions as of february 28 2007 we leased 61 of our 81 retail stores and owned the remaining 20 stores we also own our home office building in richmond va and land associated with planned future store openings 

 

expansion 

we believe that we are well positioned to succeed in the highly competitive automotive retail industry we have built a strong foundation for future growth based upon our unique knowledge of the used car market established presence in key locations and ability to execute our business plan in a market subject to continuous change we continue to refine our operating strategies and have grown to be the nation’s largest retailer of used cars specifically we have enhanced our ability to identify profitable markets and determine the appropriate store formats to fit those markets 

 

we plan to open superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15 to 20 of our used car superstore base in fiscal 2008 we plan to open approximately 13 superstores including 5 standardsized superstores and 8 satellite superstores expanding our store base by 17 our fiscal 2008 expansion plans are largely focused on opening standard superstores in new midsized markets and satellite superstores in existing markets we generally define 

 

 

 

midsized markets as those with television viewing populations of between 600000 and 25 million people historically midsized markets have been the easiest to enter from a real estate and an advertisingawareness building perspective and they are where we have generally experienced the fastest rampup in store sales and profitability we are also beginning to resume store growth in new large markets 

 

for additional details on fiscal 2008 planned store openings please see “operations outlook” included in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

 




 it em 3 legal proceedings 

 

on august 29 2006 heather herron et al filed a putative class action lawsuit against numerous south carolina automobile dealers including carmax auto superstores inc in the court of common pleas in aiken county south carolina subject to final judicial approval we have settled this lawsuit and we believe the settlement will not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 

 

we are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business based upon our evaluation of information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect either individually or in the aggregate on our financial position liquidity or results of operations

business overview 

 

general 

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used vehicles we pioneered the used car superstore concept opening our first store in 1993 at february 28 2007 we operated 77 used car superstores in 36 markets including 26 midsized markets 9 large markets and 1 small market we define midsized markets as those with television viewing populations generally between 600000 and 25 million people we also operated seven new car franchises all of which are integrated or colocated with our used car superstores in fiscal 2007 we sold 337021 used cars representing 95 of the total 355584 vehicles we sold at retail 

 

we believe the carmax consumer offer is unique in the automobile retailing marketplace our offer gives consumers a way to shop for cars in the same manner that they shop for items at other “big box” retailers our consumer offer is structured around our four core equities low nohaggle prices a broad selection high quality and customerfriendly service our website carmaxcom is a valuable tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer a sophisticated search engine and an efficient channel for customers who prefer to conduct their shopping online we generate revenues income and cash flows primarily by retailing used vehicles and associated items including vehicle financing extended service plans “esp” and retail service a majority of the used vehicles we sell at retail are purchased directly from consumers 

 

we also generate revenues income and cash flows from the sale of vehicles purchased through our appraisal process that do not meet our retail standards these vehicles are sold at our onsite wholesale auctions wholesale auctions are conducted at the majority of our superstores and are held on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis in fiscal 2007 we sold 208959 vehicles at our wholesale auctions on average the vehicles we wholesale are approximately 10 years old and have more than 100000 miles participation in our wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers and licensed wholesalers 

 

carmax provides financing to qualified customers through carmax auto finance “caf” the company’s finance operation and bank of america and through several other thirdparty lenders we collect fixed prenegotiated fees from the majority of our thirdparty lenders and we periodically test additional lenders carmax has no recourse liability for the loans provided by thirdparty lenders 

 

we sell esps on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors we have no contractual liability to the customer under these thirdparty service plans extended service plan revenue represents commissions from the unrelated third parties 

 

we are still at a relatively early stage in the national rollout of our retail concept we believe the primary driver for future earnings growth will be vehicle unit sales growth from comparable stores and from geographic expansion 

 

 

 

we target a similar dollar amount of gross profit per used unit regardless of retail price used unit sales growth is our primary focus we plan to open used car superstores at a rate of approximately 15 to 20 of our used car superstore base each year in fiscal 2008 we plan to open 13 superstores expanding our store base by approximately 17 over the long term we expect comparable store used unit sales increases to average in the range of 4 to 8 reflecting the multiyear ramp in sales at newly opened stores as they mature continued market share gains at stores that have reached basic maturity sales levels which we estimate occurs in a store’s fifth year of operation and underlying industry sales growth 

 

the principal challenges we face in expanding our store base include our ability to build our management bench strength to support the store growth and our ability to procure suitable real estate at reasonable costs we staff each newly opened store with an experienced management team we must therefore continually recruit train and develop managers and associates to fill the pipeline necessary to support future store openings if at any time we believed that the rate of store growth was causing our performance to falter we would consider slowing the growth rate 

 

fiscal 2007 highlights 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions note 2 includes a discussion of significant accounting policies the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment our financial results might have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 

 

securitization transactions 

we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the automobile loan receivables originated by caf the securitization transactions are accounted for as sales a gain recorded at the time of the securitization transaction 

 

 

 

results from recording a receivable equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables the fair value of our retained interest in securitization transactions includes the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables cash reserve accounts and an undivided ownership interest in the receivables 

 

the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables is determined by estimating the future cash flows using management’s assumptions of key factors such as finance charge income loss rates prepayment rates and discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk these assumptions are derived from historical experience and projected economic trends adjustments to one or more of these assumptions may have a material impact on the fair value of the retained interest the fair value of the retained interest may also be affected by external factors such as changes in the behavior patterns of customers changes in the economy and developments in the interest rate markets note 2c includes a discussion of accounting policies related to securitizations note 4 includes a discussion of securitizations and provides a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect on the retained interest if there were variations from the assumptions used in addition see the “carmax auto finance income” section of this mda for a discussion of the effect of changes in our assumptions 

 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete generally either at the time of sale to a customer or upon delivery to a customer we recognize used vehicle revenue when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered net of a reserve for returns under our 5day moneyback guarantee a reserve for vehicle returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends and it could be affected if future vehicle returns differ from historical averages 

 

we also sell esps on behalf of unrelated third parties to customers who purchase a vehicle because these third parties are the primary obligors under these programs we recognize commission revenue on the esps at the time of the sale net of a reserve for returns the reserve for esp returns is recorded based on historical experience and trends and it could be affected if future returns differ from historical averages 

 

income taxes 

estimates and judgments are used in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets in the ordinary course of business transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain at the time of the transactions we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that it is probable that our actual results will differ from our estimates tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 

 

we evaluate the need to record valuation allowances that would reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future reversals of existing temporary differences and future taxable income we believe that all of our recorded deferred tax assets as of february 28 2007 will more likely than not be realized however if a change in circumstances results in a change in our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period when the change in circumstances occurs 

 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due if payments of these amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment a further charge to expense would result in the period of determination 

 

information regarding income taxes is presented in note 7 

 

defined benefit retirement plan 

the plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note 8 plan assets which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments are valued using current market quotations plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries using a number of assumptions provided by the company key assumptions used to measure the plan obligations include the discount rate the 

 

 

 

estimated rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets in determining the discount rate we use the current yield on highquality fixedincome investments that have maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments salary increase assumptions are based upon our historical experience and anticipated future board and management actions asset returns are estimated based upon the anticipated average yield on the plan assets we do not believe that any significant changes in assumptions used to measure the plan obligations are likely to occur that would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

 

results of operations 

 

net sales and operating revenues 

 

retail vehicle sales changes 

 

comparable store used unit sales growth is one of the key drivers of our profitability a store is included in comparable store retail sales in the store’s fourteenth full month of operation 

comparable store retail vehicle sales changes 

 

 

change in used car superstore base 

 

 

used vehicle sales 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 the 23 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 reflected a 16 increase in unit sales and a 6 increase in average retail selling price the unit sales growth reflected a 9 increase in comparable store used units together with sales from newer superstores not yet in the comparable store base our comparable store used unit sales growth benefited from strong store and internet traffic and continued strong execution by our store teams the increase in the average retail selling price was primarily the result of a shift in vehicle mix as we experienced a resurgence in the sales of suvs and trucks which we believe had been adversely affected in the prior year by consumer reaction to higher gasoline prices the increase in average retail selling price also reflected growth in the percentage of luxury vehicles in our sales mix 

 

sales financed by drive financial services declined to less than 1 of our used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2007 from approximately 3 in fiscal 2006 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 this lender implemented program changes in certain states narrowing the selection of vehicles it would finance and making this business less economically attractive to us we chose to curtail our business with drive in these states to preserve margins and profits the decline in drivefinanced sales in fiscal 2007 was substantially offset however by incremental sales financed by additional lenders added to our thirdparty lender group in the second half of fiscal 2006 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 the 19 increase in used vehicle revenues in fiscal 2006 reflected a 15 increase in unit sales and a 4 increase in average retail selling price the unit sales growth reflected sales from newer superstores not yet in the comparable store base together with a 4 increase in comparable store used units the comparable store used unit sales growth was driven by an increase in store traffic combined with continued strong execution by our store teams store traffic and comparable store sales increases were particularly strong during the period from june through september 2005 which coincided with the domestic new car manufacturers’ employee pricing incentive programs under these programs the manufacturers established specific “employee” prices available to all consumers for each make and model these programs created greater clarity on new car pricing and increased traffic in the marketplace both of which we believe benefited carmax our nohaggle consumer offer makes price comparing easy and we believe it gives us a unique advantage as consumers crossshop 

 

sales financed by drive which was added to our thirdparty lender group in midfiscal 2005 remained approximately 3 of total used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 the fullyear benefit of adding this lender was offset by the program curtailments made in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 

 

new vehicle sales 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 the 11 decline in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 was substantially the result of a decline in unit sales and in part reflects our strategic decision in fiscal 2007 to increase targeted gross profit dollars per unit on new vehicles we had anticipated that this decision would result in some reduction in new vehicle unit sales the decline in new vehicle unit sales also reflects the effects of reduced industry new car sales for several of the brands we represent including chevrolet daimlerchrysler and nissan 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 the 2 increase in new vehicle revenues in fiscal 2006 was due to a 1 increase in unit sales and a 1 increase in average retail selling price new vehicle unit sales were strong during the domestic new car manufacturers’ employee pricing programs in june through september 2005 however these increases were substantially offset by the effects of softer industry new car sales in the months following the end of these programs new vehicle sales were generally in line with industry performance for the core brands we 

 

 

 

represent—chevrolet daimlerchrysler nissan and toyota our disposition of five new car franchises in the second half of fiscal 2005 also affected the change in our new car unit sales 

 

wholesale vehicle sales 

our operating strategy is to build customer satisfaction by offering highquality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired from consumers through the appraisal purchase process meet our standards for reconditioning and subsequent retail sale those vehicles that do not meet our standards are sold at our onsite wholesale auctions 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 the 18 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2007 resulted from a 16 increase in wholesale unit sales and a 1 increase in average wholesale selling price our wholesale unit sales benefited from a substantial increase in appraisal traffic primarily spurred by our strong comparable store unit sales growth and the expansion of our store base in the first half of fiscal 2007 our average wholesale selling price climbed 6 reflecting we believe the residual effects of industry shortages of older highermileage vehicles experienced following hurricanes katrina rita and wilma in the fall of 2005 in the second half of fiscal 2007 our average wholesale selling price was 4 below the prior year level reflecting the challenging comparison with the previous year 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 the 32 increase in wholesale vehicle revenues in fiscal 2006 reflected a 16 increase in wholesale unit sales and a 14 increase in average wholesale selling price our wholesale unit sales growth benefited from a strong increase in appraisal traffic combined with the expansion of our store base appraisal traffic was higher throughout fiscal 2006 but it was particularly strong in the second quarter we believe this increase was due in part to the domestic new car manufacturers’ employee pricing programs in these programs franchised dealers lost some ability to negotiate on tradeins due to their inability to negotiate on the published employee discount price on new cars in addition the employee pricing programs coincided with a period of rapid decline in wholesale values for suvs and large trucks as the result of a spike in gasoline prices making some dealers reluctant to accept these vehicles in trade these factors created an influx of appraisal traffic at carmax as we continued to make appraisal purchase offers on all vehicles presented for appraisal appraisal traffic also benefited from our focused “we buy cars” advertising during fiscal 2006 

 

our onsite wholesale auctions exhibited unusual aggregate price strength in fiscal 2006 reflecting trends in the general wholesale market we believe some of the factors that may have contributed to the unusually strong wholesale market pricing environment during various portions of the year included reduced supplies of offlease and offrental cars the strong demand for smaller fuelefficient cars in the face of rising gasoline prices and hurricanes katrina rita and wilma which destroyed an estimated 400000 to 600000 vehicles and created a shortterm supplydemand imbalance wholesale industry price increases were especially strong in older higher mileage cars that make up the majority of the vehicles we sell at wholesale our wholesale prices also benefited from a record level of dealer attendance at our auctions and a record dealertocar ratio in fiscal 2006 we believe the high dealer attendance at our auctions reflected the industry shortage of older vehicles as well as our continuing efforts to attract dealers to our auctions 

 

other sales and revenues 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   other sales and revenues increased 10 in fiscal 2007 the increase was primarily the result of increased sales of esps and an increase in thirdparty finance fees the increase in esp sales was consistent with our increase in used vehicle unit sales the thirdparty finance fees benefited from the decline in drivefinanced sales we record the discount at which this lender purchases loans as an offset to the thirdparty finance fee revenues service department sales declined modestly in fiscal 2007 as the reconditioning activities required to support our strong comparable store used vehicle sales growth limited the service capacity available for customer pay work 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 other sales and revenues increased 14 in fiscal 2006 as all components benefited from the increase in retail vehicle sales and the expansion of our superstore base

gross profit 

 

 

 

 

used vehicle gross profit 

we target a similar dollar amount of gross profit per used unit regardless of retail price our ability to quickly adjust appraisal offers to be consistent with the broader market tradein trends and our rapid inventory turns reduce our exposure to the inherent continual depreciation in used vehicle values and contribute to our ability to manage our gross profit dollars per unit in addition over the past few years we have continued to refine our carbuying strategies which we believe has benefited our used vehicle gross profit per unit 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 our used vehicle gross profit increased 95 per unit in fiscal 2007 this increase reflected the benefit of our strong consistent sales performance throughout the year we believe several external factors contributed to a greater degree of sales volatility in the prior year including significant changes in gasoline prices new vehicle incentives and interest rates we did not experience similar variability in these external factors in fiscal 2007 and therefore benefited from a more stable business environment we employ a volumebased strategy and we systematically mark down individual vehicle prices based on our proprietary pricing algorithms in order to appropriately balance sales growth inventory turns and gross profit achievement when customer traffic and our sales are consistently strong we generally take fewer pricing markdowns which in turn maximizes our gross profit dollars per unit in addition our used vehicle gross profit in fiscal 2006 was adversely affected by slowing demand for suvs and trucks that have lower gas mileage which resulted in higher pricing markdowns for these vehicles 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 while our used vehicle gross profit dollars per unit in fiscal 2006 was similar to that achieved in fiscal 2005 our used vehicle gross profits remained under some pressure throughout fiscal 2006 the profit pressure was primarily the result of the combination of the strong wholesale industry pricing and our desire to price our retail cars at competitive levels for consumers comparing options in the new and used car markets a strong wholesale industry pricing environment increases our cost of acquiring vehicles both in our instore purchases and at auction we were able to offset some of the resulting profit pressure through successful refinements in our instore appraisal strategy during portions of fiscal 2006 we did not increase our appraisal offers at the same rate as the steep increase in the major public wholesale auction market prices as we did not believe the price trends at the major public wholesale auctions were reflective of the broader market tradein offer trends this belief was reinforced by the fact that we continued to experience strong increases in appraisal traffic while maintaining our ratio of appraisal buys to appraisal offers this strategy allowed us to keep our retail prices more in line with underlying retail demand while maintaining gross profit dollars per unit 

 

new vehicle gross profit 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   our new vehicle gross profit increased 235 per unit in fiscal 2007 the increase primarily reflected our strategic decision to increase targeted new vehicle gross profit dollars per unit while this decision contributed to a reduction in new vehicle unit sales it resulted in an increase in the total gross profit contribution from new vehicles 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 our new vehicle gross profit increased 74 per unit in fiscal 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to the higher profits realized during the domestic new car manufacturers’ employee pricing programs we were able to modestly increase our new car prices during these programs as our pricing had generally been below the manufacturers’ specified employee discount prices 

 

 

 

wholesale vehicle gross profit 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   in spite of the challenging comparison with the prior year our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 42 per unit in fiscal 2007 our wholesale vehicle profitability has steadily increased over the last several years reflecting the benefits realized from improvements and refinements in our carbuying strategies our appraisal delivery processes and our instore auction processes we have made continuous improvements in these processes which we believe has allowed us to become more efficient our instore auctions have benefited from our initiatives to increase average dealer attendance which we believe has allowed us to achieve higher prices 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 our wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 236 per unit in fiscal 2006 we believe a portion of this increase resulted from the unusually strong wholesale pricing environment in fiscal 2006 in addition the refinements in our instore appraisal strategy benefited our wholesale operations while allowing us to maintain used vehicle gross profit dollars per unit levels in the face of rising vehicle acquisition costs while we did not increase our appraisal offers at the same rate as the steep increase in the major public wholesale auction market prices our own wholesale auctions generally reflected the pricing trends of the public wholesale auctions 

 

our wholesale gross profit was particularly strong in the second half of fiscal 2006 as the result of a combination of factors the supplydemand imbalance for older higher mileage cars created by hurricanes katrina rita and wilma resulted in unusually strong demand and price realizations for our wholesale vehicles in addition as we normally do in the third quarter we adjusted our appraisal offers to incorporate the anticipated seasonal drop in wholesale pricing wholesale industry pricing typically declines during the fall due to pressure from model year closeout sales and from reduced demand at auction as dealers pare back inventories heading into the slowervolume winter months we were particularly aggressive in our appraisals of suvs where wholesale prices had fallen dramatically through the summer following sharp increases in the cost of gasoline pricing in the overall wholesale marketplace did not decline as much as anticipated however giving us unusually high third quarter wholesale gross profits 

 

other gross profit 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   other gross profit increased 40 per unit in fiscal 2007 the improvement was the result of the growth in esp sales and thirdparty finance fees both of which have no associated cost of sales and an increase in service department margins our service department reported higher profits reflecting the greater overhead expense absorption provided by the significant increase in used vehicles sales and the associated reconditioning volumes 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 other gross profit per unit increased 25 per unit in fiscal 2006 the improvement was primarily the result of improved penetration in sales of esps and the growth in service profits the service department which is the only category within other sales and revenues that has an associated cost of sales reported higher profits reflecting the greater overhead expense absorption provided by the higher vehicle sales and reconditioning volumes 

 

impact of inflation 

inflation has not been a significant contributor to results profitability is based on achieving targeted unit sales and gross profit dollars per vehicle rather than on average retail prices however caf income will benefit from an increase in the average amount financed 

 

carmax auto finance income 

caf provides automobile financing for our used and new car sales because the purchase of an automobile is traditionally reliant on the consumer’s ability to obtain onthespot financing it is important to our business that financing be available to creditworthy customers while financing can also be obtained from thirdparty sources we believe that total reliance on third parties can create unacceptable volatility and business risk furthermore we believe that our processes and systems the transparency of our pricing and our vehicle quality provide a unique and ideal environment in which to procure highquality auto finance receivables both for caf and for our thirdparty lenders caf provides us the opportunity to capture additional profits and cash flows from auto loan receivables while managing our reliance on thirdparty finance sources 

 

 

components of caf income 

 

percent columns indicate 

 

 

 

caf income does not include any allocation of indirect costs or income we present this information on a direct basis to avoid making arbitrary decisions regarding the indirect benefit or costs that could be attributed to this operation examples of indirect costs not included are retail store expenses and corporate expenses such as human resources administrative services marketing information systems accounting legal treasury and executive payroll 

caf originates automobile loans to qualified customers at competitive market rates of interest the majority of the profit contribution from caf is generated by the spread between the interest rates charged to customers and our cost of funds substantially all of the loans originated by caf are sold in securitization transactions a gain recorded at the time of securitization results from recording a receivable approximately equal to the present value of the expected residual cash flows generated by the securitized receivables in a normalized environment we expect the gains on loans originated and sold as a percent of loans originated and sold the “gain percentage” to be in the range of 35 to 45 

 

total gain income in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 included the effects of retained interest valuation adjustments new public securitizations and the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing public securitizations the following table provides information on the aggregate effect of these items on gain income loans sold and the gain percentage 

 

 

 

gain income and loans sold 

 

 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   caf income rose 27 to 1326 million in fiscal 2007 caf income benefited from the growth in retail vehicle unit sales and increases in the gain percentage average amount financed and total managed receivables the gain percentage increased to 39 in fiscal 2007 from 35 in fiscal 2006 reflecting changes in the interest rate environment in fiscal 2006 our funding costs were rising faster than rates charged to consumers resulting in a lower gain percentage in fiscal 2007 the relative stability in our funding cost allowed us to achieve a higher gain percentage the increases in other caf income and direct caf expenses in fiscal 2007 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year 

 

we recognized other gain income of 130 million or 004 per share in fiscal 2007 compared with 152 million or 004 per share in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2007 substantially all of the other gain income resulted from favorable valuation adjustments in fiscal 2006 other gain income included 003 per share of favorable valuation adjustments 001 per share of favorable effects from new public securitizations and a favorable effect of less than 001 per share from the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing public securitizations these items are discussed below 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in future years the effect of refinancing repurchase and resale activity could be favorable or unfavorable depending on the securitization structure and market conditions at the transaction date 

 

 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005   caf income rose 26 to 1043 million in fiscal 2006 the fiscal 2006 total gain income benefited from the growth in retail vehicle sales and a substantial increase in other gain income partially offset by a modest decline in the gain percentage to 35 from 37 in fiscal 2005 the increases in other caf income and direct caf expenses in fiscal 2006 were proportionate to the growth in managed receivables during the year 

 

other gain income was 152 million in fiscal 2006 compared with 33 million in fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2005 approximately half of the other gain income related to favorable valuation adjustments and the remainder primarily resulted from the repurchase and resale of receivables in existing public securitizations 

 

past due account information 

 

 

credit loss information 

 

 

we are at risk for the performance of the managed securitized receivables to the extent of our retained interest in the receivables if the managed receivables do not perform in accordance with the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the retained interest earnings could be impacted past due accounts as a percentage of total managed receivables increased moderately in fiscal 2007 while credit losses as a percentage of averaged managed receivables decreased slightly in fiscal 2007 the decrease was attributable to favorability in the first half of the year offset by higher losses in the second half of the year we believe the increase in losses during the second half of the year was the result of a combination of factors including a gradual shift in credit mix of the portfolio as well as less favorable general economic and industry trends receivables originated in calendar years 2003 2004 and early 2005 have experienced loss rates well below both caf’s historical averages and our targeted loss rates we believe this favorability was due in part to the credit scorecard we implemented in late 2002 as it became evident that the scorecard was resulting in lowerthanexpected loss rates caf gradually expanded its credit offers beginning in late 2004 as a result receivables originated in late 2005 and 2006 have been experiencing higher loss and delinquency rates than receivables originated in those prior years the changes in loss and delinquency rates were largely anticipated and were incorporated in our initial loss assumptions for these pools 

 

the recovery rate represents the average percentage of the outstanding principal balance we receive when a vehicle is repossessed and liquidated at wholesale auction we believe the improvement in the recovery rate in fiscal 2006 reflected the stronger wholesale market pricing environment 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006   the sga ratio declined to 104 from 108 in fiscal 2006 we benefited from the leverage of fixed expenses generated by our strong comparable store sales growth the improvement in the fiscal 2007 sga ratio was partially offset by an increase in sharebased compensation costs and by the recognition of an impairment loss totaling 49 million or 001 per share the impairment loss related to the write down of intangible assets associated with one of our new car franchises 

 

 

 

we recognized 327 million or 009 per share of sharebased compensation costs in fiscal 2007 304 million of which was included in sga compared with 224 million or 007 per share in fiscal 2006 all of which was included in sga the increase in sharebased compensation cost was driven in large part by the accelerated vesting of stock options upon the retirement of our former chief executive officer in august 2006 

 

fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005   the sga ratio increased slightly to 108 from 107 in fiscal 2005 the moderate rate of increase in comparable store used unit sales in fiscal 2006 was not sufficient to provide sga leverage the increase in the percentage of our store base that is comprised of newer stores not yet at basic maturity which generally occurs in the fifth year of operation also was a contributing factor newer stores typically experience higher sga ratios during their first four years of operation on average 45 of our stores were less than four years old in fiscal 2006 compared with 37 in fiscal 2005 costs associated with the launch of marketwide television advertising in los angeles in fiscal 2006 and the lowerthannormal corporate bonus expense in fiscal 2005 also precluded sga leverage 

 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 386 in fiscal 2007 383 in fiscal 2006 and 389 in fiscal 2005 the fiscal 2006 decrease resulted primarily from a legal entity reorganization in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we created a centralized corporate management entity in an effort to obtain operational legal and other benefits that also resulted in state tax efficiencies 

 

operations outlook 

 

store openings and capital expenditures 

during the fiscal year ending february 29 2008 we plan to expand our used car superstore base by approximately 17 opening an estimated 13 used car superstores 

 

fiscal 2008 planned superstore openings 

 

 

we expect to enter five new markets and expand our presence in six existing markets in fiscal 2008 we currently expect to open approximately four superstores in the first half of fiscal 2008 and nine superstores in the second half of the year however normal construction permitting or other scheduling delays could shift opening dates of stores into the following fiscal year 

 

in fiscal 2008 we also plan to open three additional car buying centers with one each in the raleigh dallas and tampa markets these sites will expand a test begun in fiscal 2007 when we opened our first car buying center in the atlanta market we only conduct appraisals and purchase cars at these sites and do not sell cars these test stores are part of our longterm program to increase both appraisal traffic and retail vehicle sourcing selfsufficiency 

 

we currently estimate gross capital expenditures will total approximately 300 million in fiscal 2008 planned expenditures primarily relate to new store construction and land purchases associated with future year store openings compared with the approximately 192 million spent in fiscal 2007 the fiscal 2008 capital spending 

 

 

 

estimate reflects more real estate purchases for future development in larger multistore markets in addition the fiscal 2007 capital spending amount was lower than originally projected due in part to the acquisition of some store sites pursuant to ground leases 

 

fiscal 2008 expectations 

the fiscal 2008 expectations discussed below are based on historical and current trends in our business and should be read in conjunction with “risk factors” in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

 

fiscal 2008 sales we currently anticipate comparable store used unit growth for fiscal 2008 in the range of 3 to 9 we also expect wholesale unit sales growth to be consistent with our total used unit sales increase total revenues are expected to climb by between 14 and 20 reflecting our expectations for comparable store used unit growth new store openings a modest increase in used vehicle average selling price and a continued decline in our new vehicle sales 

 

fiscal 2008 earnings per share we currently anticipate fiscal 2008 earnings per share in the range of 103 to 114 representing eps growth in the range of 12 to 24 we expect modest improvement in both used vehicle and wholesale gross profits per unit in fiscal 2008 as we continue to refine and improve our carbuying processes 

 

we expect caf income to increase modestly but at a pace slower than anticipated sales growth primarily reflecting the challenging comparison created by the 130 million of favorable caf items reported in fiscal 2007 the caf gain percentage is anticipated to be slightly above the midpoint of our normalized 35 to 45 range in fiscal 2008 assuming no significant change in the interest rate environment 

 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be similar to the fiscal 2007 rate however our diluted share count is expected to increase by approximately 3 reflecting the effects of the recent increase in our stock price and option exercises on the weighted average share calculation the diluted share count for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 was 14 higher than the average for the full year accounting for approximately onehalf of the anticipated 3 increase

financial condition 

 

operating activities 

we generated net cash from operating activities of 1368 million in fiscal 2007 1175 million in fiscal 2006 and 418 million in fiscal 2005 cash generated from operating activities was 193 million higher in fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 the 644 million increase in net earnings in fiscal 2007 was more than offset by the increased growth in inventories inventories increased by 1664 million in fiscal 2007 compared with a 931 million increase in fiscal 2006 the fiscal 2007 inventory increase related to store openings during fiscal 2007 and shortly after the end of the fiscal year as well as to added vehicle inventory required to support our strong increase in fourth quarter comparable store used unit sales 

 

cash generated from operating activities was 757 million higher in fiscal 2006 compared with fiscal 2005 the increase reflected the 329 million increase in net earnings in fiscal 2006 and a 446 million reduction in the yearoveryear growth in working capital 

 

the aggregate principal amount of automobile loan receivables funded through securitizations which are discussed in notes 3 and 4 totaled 324 billion at february 28 2007 271 billion at february 28 2006 and 243 billion at february 28 2005 during fiscal 2007 we completed three public automobile securitizations totaling 187 billion at february 28 2007 the warehouse facility limit was 8250 million and unused warehouse capacity totaled 2270 million the warehouse facility matures in july 2007 note 4 includes a discussion of the warehouse facility we anticipate that we will be able to renew expand or enter into new securitization arrangements to meet caf’s future needs 

 

 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities was 1872 million in fiscal 2007 1161 million in fiscal 2006 and 1411 million in fiscal 2005 capital expenditures were 1918 million in fiscal 2007 1944 million in fiscal 2006 and 2301 million in fiscal 2005 in addition to store construction costs capital expenditures for all three years included the cost of land acquired for future year store openings in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 capital expenditures also included costs associated with our new home office which was completed in october 2005 

 

historically capital expenditures have been funded with internally generated funds short and longterm debt and saleleaseback transactions net proceeds from the sales of assets totaled 46 million in fiscal 2007 783 million in fiscal 2006 and 890 million in fiscal 2005 the majority of the sale proceeds in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 related to saleleaseback transactions in fiscal 2006 we entered into saleleaseback transactions involving five superstores valued at 727 million in fiscal 2005 we entered into saleleaseback transactions involving seven superstores valued at approximately 840 million these transactions were structured with initial lease terms of either 15 or 20 years with four fiveyear renewal options at february 28 2007 we owned 20 superstores currently in operation as well as the company’s home office in richmond virginia in addition six store facilities were accounted for as capital leases 

 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 481 million in fiscal 2007 32 million in fiscal 2006 and 677 million in fiscal 2005 we used cash generated from operations to reduce total debt by 95 million in fiscal 2007 and 68 million in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2005 we increased total debt by 602 million primarily to fund increased inventory 

 

in december 2006 we amended our revolving credit facility the term of the agreement was extended from august 2009 to december 2011 and the aggregate borrowings available under the agreement were increased from 450 million to 500 million borrowings under this credit facility are available for working capital and general corporate purposes and are secured by our vehicle inventory 

 

as of february 28 2007 1507 million was outstanding under the credit facility with the remainder fully available to us the outstanding balance included 33 million classified as shortterm debt and 1474 million classified as current portion of longterm debt we classified the outstanding balance at february 28 2007 as current portion of longterm debt based on our expectation that this balance will not remain outstanding for more than one year 

 

cash received on equity issuances which primarily related to employee stock option exercises increased to 354 million in fiscal 2007 compared with 60 million in fiscal 2006 and 43 million in fiscal 2005 the increase reflected exercises by the former chief executive officer in connection with his retirement and other exercises prompted by the significant increase in our stock price in fiscal 2007 

 

we expect that cash generated by operations proceeds from securitization transactions and if needed additional debt and saleleaseback transactions will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and working capital for the foreseeable future

offbalance sheet arrangements 

caf provides financing for our used and new car sales we use a securitization program to fund substantially all of the automobile loan receivables originated by caf we sell the automobile loan receivables to a wholly owned bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that transfers an undivided interest in the receivables to a group of thirdparty investors this program is referred to as the warehouse facility 

 

we periodically use public securitizations to refinance the receivables previously securitized through the warehouse facility in a public securitization a pool of automobile loan receivables is sold to a bankruptcyremote special purpose entity that in turn transfers the receivables to a special purpose securitization trust 

 

additional information regarding the nature business purposes and importance of our offbalance sheet arrangement to our liquidity and capital resources can be found in the carmax auto finance income financial condition and market risk sections of this mda as well as in notes 3 and 4 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

automobile installment loan receivables 

at february 28 2007 and february 28 2006 all loans in our portfolio of automobile loan receivables were fixedrate installment loans financing for these automobile loan receivables is achieved through asset securitization programs that in turn issue both fixed and floatingrate securities we manage the interest rate exposure relating to floatingrate securitizations through the use of interest rate swaps receivables held for investment or sale are financed with working capital generally changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps will not have a material impact on earnings however changes in interest rates associated with underlying swaps may have a material impact on cash and cash flows 

 

credit risk is the exposure to nonperformance of another party to an agreement we mitigate credit risk by dealing with highly rated bank counterparties the market and credit risks associated with financial derivatives are similar to those relating to other types of financial instruments refer to note 5 for a description of these items 

 

composition of automobile loan receivables 

 

 

 

 

interest rate exposure 

we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt substantially all of our debt is floatingrate debt based on libor a 100basis point increase in market interest rates would have decreased our fiscal 2007 net earnings per share by less than 001

business overview 

carmax inc was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 its corporate offices are located at 12800 tuckahoe creek parkway richmond va carmax inc is a holding company and its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries 

under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” carmax began operations in 1993 when it opened its first superstore in richmond va in fiscal 1997 circuit city created two common stock series circuit city stores inc–circuit city group common stock and circuit city stores inc–carmax group “carmax group” common stock on february 7 1997 circuit city completed an initial public offering of carmax group common stock which was intended to track separately the performance of the carmax operations on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction in which each share of carmax group common stock was exchanged for one share of carmax inc common stock in addition each holder of circuit city group common stock received a distribution of a 0313879 share of carmax inc common stock for each circuit city group share owned as a result of the separation all of the businesses assets and liabilities of the former carmax group are held in carmax inc an independent separately traded public company 

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used cars carmax was the first used vehicle retailer to offer a large selection of high quality used vehicles at competitively low fixed prices using a customerfriendly sales process in an attractive modern sales facility the carmax consumer offer provides consumers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers carmax has designed a strategy to better serve the auto retailing market by addressing the major sources of dissatisfaction with traditional auto retailers and to maximize operating efficiencies with standardized operating procedures and store formats enhanced by sophisticated proprietary management information systems 

the company purchases reconditions and sells used vehicles in general the used vehicles retailed by carmax are one to six years old with fewer than 60000 miles all used vehicles are thoroughly reconditioned to meet high mechanical electrical safety and cosmetic standards and must pass a comprehensive inspection before being offered for sale each superstore also offers a selection of used vehicles that are more than six years old or have more than 60000 miles but which meet similar quality standards 

  

the company also sells new vehicles under franchise agreements with four new car manufacturers in fiscal 2006 new vehicles comprised 7 of the company’s total retail vehicle unit sales as planned carmax’s new car sales have become a smaller part of its business mix over the past five fiscal years as it has divested 14 new car franchises while aggressively growing its used car business carmax expects to maintain longterm relationships with the automotive manufacturers that it currently represents 

carmax provides its customers with a full range of related products and services including the financing of vehicle purchases through carmax auto finance “caf” the company’s own finance operation and thirdparty lenders the sale of extended service plans and accessories the appraisal and purchase of vehicles directly from consumers and vehicle repair service 

the carmax consumer offer enables customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions based on comprehensive information about the options terms and associated prices of each component the customer can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer carmax’s “nohaggle” pricing and its commission structure which is based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard allow its sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

the company has separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions carmax will appraise a consumer’s vehicle and make a cash offer to purchase that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from carmax carmax acquires the majority of its retail used vehicle inventory through this unique instore appraisal process the company also acquires a significant portion of its used vehicles through wholesale auctions and to a lesser extent directly from other sources including wholesalers dealers and fleet owners vehicles purchased through the company’s instore appraisal process that do not meet carmax’s retail standards are sold at onsite wholesale auctions 

carmax’s inventory management and control system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process using the information provided by this system and applying sophisticated statistical modeling techniques enable carmax to optimize its inventory mix and display by store anticipate future inventory needs at each store evaluate sales consultant performance and refine its vehicle pricing strategy because of the pricing discipline afforded by the inventory management and pricing system more than 99 of the entire inventory offered at retail is sold at retail 

since opening its first superstore in 1993 carmax has expanded its store base to 67 superstores in 31 us markets as of the end of fiscal 2006 the company opened a total of 33 used car superstores through fiscal 2000 before suspending new store development to focus on improving sales and profits carmax resumed opening new stores at the end of fiscal 2002 and is currently opening used car superstores at an annual rate of approximately 15 to 20 of the company’s superstore base 

industry and competition with calendar year 2005 sales of approximately 370 billion used vehicles comprise nearly half of the us auto retail market the largest retail segment of the economy in calendar 2005 there were an estimated 44 million used vehicles sold in the us compared with approximately 17 million new vehicles carmax’s primary focus latemodel vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old is estimated at approximately 280 billion in annual sales and 21 million units per year 

the us used car marketplace is highly fragmented and competitive and includes approximately 21600 franchised new car dealers and 44700 independent dealers as well as millions of private individuals the company’s primary competitors are the franchised new car dealers who sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles independent dealers predominantly sell older higher mileage cars than does carmax in both the used and new vehicle markets carmax seeks to distinguish itself from traditional dealerships through its consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies 

the company believes that its principal competitive factors in used vehicle retailing are its ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience competitively low prices breadth of selection of most popular makes and models available on site at each carmax superstore and on its website carmaxcom quality of vehicles proprietary information systems and location of retail sites upon request by the customer carmax will transfer virtually any used vehicle in the company’s nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfers are free within a market longer distance transfers include a charge to cover transportation costs carmax’s certified quality inspection assures that every vehicle offered for sale at carmax meets stringent mechanical electrical and safety standards carmax backs every vehicle with a 5day moneyback guarantee and at least a 30day limited warranty other competitive factors include the ability to offer or arrange customer financing on competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of extended service plans carmax believes that it is competitive in all of these areas and that it enjoys advantages over competitors that employ traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques 

  

carmax’s sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid a commission based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard thereby earning the same dollar sales commission regardless of the price or gross margin on the vehicle being sold this ensures that the sales consultant’s primary objective is helping customers find the right cars for their needs at prices they can afford in contrast sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships often receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and for steering customers toward vehicles with higher gross margins 

in the new vehicle market carmax competes with other franchised dealers offering vehicles produced by the same or other manufacturers historically the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional automotive selling methods the company believes its customerfriendly lowpressure sales methods are points of competitive differentiation 

marketing and advertising carmax’s marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at its stores and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle the company uses market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor its marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area carmax’s marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts carmaxcom the internet and newspaper advertising television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer newspaper advertisements promote carmax’s broad selection of vehicles and price competitiveness targeting consumers with immediate purchase intentions broadcast internet and newspaper advertisements are designed to drive customers to carmax stores and to carmaxcom 

the media landscape is changing rapidly and carmax is changing its marketing programs in response the company is customizing its marketing program based on awareness levels in each market in selected markets carmax is expanding its use of internetbased advertising while deemphasizing its use of newspaper advertising the company is building awareness and driving traffic to its stores and carmaxcom by listing every retail vehicle on both autotradercom and carscom through their syndication networks autotradercom and carscom vehicle listings appear on sites that are visited by more than 80 of all latemodel used vehicle buyers who use the internet in their shopping process the company’s advertising on the internet also includes banner and keyword advertisements on search engines such as google and yahoo 

the company’s website carmaxcom is a marketing tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online the carmax website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on the more than 22000 cars available in the company’s nationwide inventory is updated daily carmaxcom includes detailed information such as vehicle photos prices features specifications and store locations as well as sorting and comparison features that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and an option to estimate tradein values via a link with kelley blue book customers can contact sales consultants online via carmaxcom by telephone or by fax customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home including applying for financing and need to visit the store only to sign the paperwork and pick up their vehicle 

suppliers for used vehicles carmax acquires its used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through its unique instore appraisal process and through other sources including local and regional auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies in calendar 2005 more than 23 million used vehicles were remarketed in the us of which approximately 96 million were sold at wholesale auction 

the carmax instore appraisal offer process gives the company access to individual consumers as its largest source for used vehicle inventory the most popular makes and models are more readily available directly from consumers than from other sources in stores open for more than a year carmax acquires the majority of its used vehicle inventory directly from consumers this buying strategy also helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the tastes of each market in may 2006 carmax began testing a standalone carbuying center in the atlanta market in a major automotive retail center not currently served by carmax staffed by carmax buyers this store is intended to increase appraisal traffic and the number of vehicles sourced from individual consumers the company does not sell cars at this store 

carmax has replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which a carmaxtrained buyer appraises the vehicle and provides the vehicle’s owner with a written guaranteed cash offer that is good for 7 days or 300 miles whichever comes first an appraisal is available to every customer free of charge whether or not the individual purchases a vehicle from carmax based on their age mileage or condition fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through this instore appraisal process meet the company’s high quality retail standards those vehicles that do not meet carmax’s retail standards are sold at the company’s onsite wholesale auctions 

  

the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers who handle both onsite appraisals and offsite auction purchases carmax buyers evaluate all used vehicles on the basis of their estimated wholesale value and reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases cost of delivery to the store where they will be reconditioned to decide which inventory to purchase at offsite auctions carmax’s buyers in collaboration with its home office staff rely on the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system the company’s inventory and pricing models help the buyers tailor inventories to the buying preferences at each superstore recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turnover to help maintain gross margin dollars per unit 

based on consumer acceptance of the instore appraisal process at existing carmax stores the company’s experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources and the large size of the us auction market relative to the company’s needs carmax believes that its sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet current needs and to support planned expansion 

suppliers for new vehicles carmax operates seven new car franchises under separate agreements with manufacturers new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales and service agreements with daimlerchrysler general motors nissan and toyota these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies a manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances including a change in ownership without prior manufacturer approval failure to maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings or a material breach of other provisions of the agreement carmax also has entered into framework agreements with several of the manufacturers noted above these agreements generally contain provisions relating to the acquisition ownership structure advertising and management of a dealership franchised by those manufacturers 

seasonality carmax’s business is seasonal most carmax superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer fiscal quarters sales and gross margins are typically lowest in the fall quarter which coincides with the new vehicle modelyearchangeover period in the fall quarter the new model year introductions and discounts on model year closeouts generally can cause rapid depreciation in used car pricing particularly for latemodel used cars seasonal patterns for car buying and selling may vary in different parts of the country and as carmax expands geographically these differences could have an effect on the overall seasonal pattern of the company’s results 

products and services 

merchandising carmax offers its customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices carmax’s used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler ford general motors honda mitsubishi nissan and toyota and luxury brands such as acura bmw infiniti lexus and mercedes the company’s primary focus is vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old have fewer than 60000 miles and generally range in price from 11000 to 31000 each vehicle must pass a comprehensive quality inspection that covers all major and minor mechanical systems and all safety functions as well as cosmetic criteria for the more costconscious consumer the company also offers used cars that are more than 6 years old or have 60000 miles or more and that generally range in price from 8000 to 21000 these older vehicles must pass a quality inspection covering the major mechanical systems and all safety functions 

carmax has implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which it sets nohaggle prices on both its used and new vehicles the company believes that its pricing is competitive with the best negotiated prices in the market prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom autotradercom and carscom and in carmax’s newspaper advertising carmax extends its nohaggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction including vehicle appraisal offers financing rates accessories extended service plan pricing and vehicle documentation fees in addition to selling new vehicles using the low nohaggle price strategy the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow carmax to perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 

reconditioning and service an integral part of carmax’s used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process this process includes a comprehensive certified quality inspection of the engine and all major systems including cooling fuel drivetrain transmission electronics suspension brakes steering air conditioning and other equipment as well as the interior and exterior of the vehicle based on this quality inspection carmax determines the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to carmax’s high quality standards vehicle inspections are completed by carmax’s service technicians carmax performs most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services carmax engages third parties specializing in those services over the past several years carmax has performed an increasing percentage of reconditioning services inhouse and based on the cost savings realized this trend is expected to continue satellite superstores depend upon nearby mega or standard superstores for reconditioning which increases efficiency and reduces overhead 

  

all carmax used car locations provide vehicle repair service including used car extended service plan repairs factoryauthorized service is also provided at all new car franchises carmax has developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that its retail repair service is conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as its other operations 

carmax believes that the efficiency of its reconditioning and service operations is enhanced by its modern facilities a technician mentoring process and its compensation programs the mentoring process and compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of service technicians and result in reduced costs and higherquality repairs carmax is able to track the productivity of each technician through the company’s information system the experienced technicians in each store perform the more complicated repairs with assistance from apprentices who also perform less complex functions on their own at the majority of the company’s stores compensation is based on an industry “flat rate” system in which the individual technician’s hourly pay rate is applied to a standard defined time unit for each repair or service performed 

wholesale auctions vehicles purchased through carmax’s instore appraisal process that do not meet the company’s retail standards are sold at onsite wholesale auctions at february 28 2006 wholesale auctions were conducted at 42 of the company’s 67 superstores auctions are generally not held at satellite superstores auctions are held on a weekly biweekly or monthly basis auction frequency at a given superstore is determined by the number of vehicles to be auctioned which depends on the number of carmax stores and the market awareness of the company and its instore appraisal offer in that market the typical wholesale vehicle is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100000 miles participation in the company’s wholesale auctions is restricted to licensed automobile dealers the majority of whom are independent dealers to participate in a carmax auction dealers must register with the company’s centralized auction support group at which time the company determines the purchase limit available to each dealer carmax makes conditional announcements on each vehicle including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues possible frame or flood damage branded titles and salvage history and unknown true mileage the auctions are conducted by professional licensed auctioneers these policies result in an auction sales rate that is generally between 95 and 100 dealers pay a fee to the company based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase 

customer credit carmax provides primerated financing to qualified customers through caf and bank of america offering customers a thirdparty alternative for prime financing enhances the carmax consumer offer and helps ensure that caf remains competitive in addition daimlerchrysler services general motors acceptance nissan motors acceptance and toyota financial services offer prime financing to qualified customers purchasing new vehicles at applicable carmax locations nonprime financing is offered by americredit financial services capital one auto finance citifinancial auto triad financial and wells fargo auto finance in selected states subprime financing is offered by drive financial services “drive” carmax has tested and will continue to test other thirdparty finance companies in order to expand the choices for its customers and increase discrete approvals 

customers applying for financing provide credit information that is electronically submitted by sales consultants through carmax’s proprietary information system first to caf and bank of america and then as necessary to its nonprime and subprime lenders responses from the lenders are received quickly generally in less than five minutes from prime lenders the vehicle financings or loans are retail installment contracts secured by the vehicles financed carmax has no recourse liability on retail installment contracts arranged with thirdparty finance companies customers are permitted to refinance or pay off their loans within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges carmax’s arrangements with its thirdparty finance companies excluding drive provide for payment of a fee to carmax at the time of financing provided the loan is not paid in full within 90 days as is customary in the subprime finance industry drive purchases the loans at a discount 

extended service plan sales at the time carmax sells a vehicle it offers the customer an extended service plan currently in all the states in which carmax operates it sells these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors under these thirdparty service plan programs carmax has no contractual liability to the customer the extended service plans have terms of coverage from 12 to 72 months depending on the vehicle age and make carmax offers these extended service plans at low fixed prices which are based primarily on the repair record of the vehicle and the length of coverage selected all extended service plans sold by carmax other than manufacturers’ warranties have been designed to carmax specifications and are administered by the third parties through privatelabel arrangements under which carmax receives a commission from the administrator at the time the extended service plan is sold 

carmax’s extended service plan customers have access to the company’s vehicle repair service at each store and to the thirdparty administrators’ nationwide network of approximately 14000 independent service providers carmax believes that the quality of the services provided by this provider network as well as the broad scope of its extended service plans helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business

competition automotive retailing is a highly competitive business carmax’s competition includes publicly and privately owned franchised new car dealers and independent dealers as well as millions of private individuals the company’s competitors may sell the same or similar makes of vehicles that carmax offers in the same or similar markets at competitive prices further new entrants to the market could result in increased wholesale costs for used vehicles and lowerthanexpected vehicle sales and margins caf is subject to competition from various financial institutions additionally competition on vehicle sales and related financing is increasing as these products are now being marketed and sold over the internet customers are using the internet to compare pricing for cars and related financing which may further reduce the company’s profitability 

retail prices any significant changes in retail prices for used and new vehicles could result in lower sales and margins for the company if any of carmax’s competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices for used or new vehicles the company would likely reduce its prices in order to remain competitive which may result in a decrease in its sales and profitability and require a change in its operating strategies 

inventory a reduction in the availability or access to sources of inventory would adversely affect the company’s business a failure to adjust appraisal offers to stay in line with the broader market tradein offer trends or a failure to recognize those trends could negatively impact carmax’s ability to acquire inventory should excess inventory develop the inability to liquidate excess inventory at prices that allow the company to meet its margin targets or to recover its costs would adversely affect the company’s profitability

business overview 

  

carmax inc was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 its corporate offices are located at 4900 cox road glen allen va carmax inc is a holding company and its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries 

  

under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” carmax began operations in 1993 when it opened its first superstore in richmond va in fiscal 1997 circuit city created two common stock series circuit city stores inc–circuit city group common stock and circuit city stores inc–carmax group “carmax group” common stock on february 7 1997 circuit city completed an initial public offering of carmax group common stock which was intended to track separately the performance of the carmax operations on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction in which each share of carmax group common stock was exchanged for one share of carmax inc common stock in addition each holder of circuit city group common stock received a distribution of a 0313879 share of carmax inc common stock for each circuit city group share owned as a result of the separation all of the businesses assets and liabilities of the former carmax group are held in carmax inc an independent separately traded public company 

  

carmax is the nation’s largest retailer of used cars the company purchases reconditions and sells used vehicles carmax opened a total of 33 used car superstores through fiscal 2000 before slowing its geographic growth to focus on improving sales and profits carmax resumed geographic growth at the end of fiscal 2002 and through the end of fiscal 2005 opened an additional 25 used car superstores the company also sells new vehicles under various franchise agreements as planned carmax’s new car sales have become a smaller part of its business mix as it has divested 14 new car franchises over the past four fiscal years while aggressively growing its used car business carmax intends to operate the seven new car franchises it currently owns for the foreseeable future in fiscal 2005 used vehicles represented 92 of the total retail vehicle units sold by carmax 

  

carmax provides its customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers by offering a broad selection of high quality vehicles at low nohaggle prices in a customerfriendly atmosphere the company has separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions carmax provides an appraisal that allows current vehicle owners to sell their cars to carmax regardless of their intent to purchase a vehicle from the company carmax also provides its customers with a full range of related services including the financing of vehicle purchases through carmax auto finance “caf” and thirdparty lenders the sale of extended service plans and accessories and vehicle repair service caf the company’s own finance operation provides primerated financing to qualified customers for used and new car sales 

  

the carmax process is designed to enable customers to evaluate separately each component of the sales process and to make informed decisions on each component based on comprehensive information about their options and the associated prices the customer can take or leave any aspect of the offer without affecting the offer on the other steps in the sales process carmax’s nohaggle pricing and its commission structure which is based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard allow its sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

  

industry and competition with calendar year 2004 sales of approximately 367 billion used vehicles make up nearly half of the us auto retail market the largest retail segment of the economy in calendar 2004 there were an estimated 425 million used vehicles sold compared with 169 million new vehicles carmax’s primary focus latemodel vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old is estimated at approximately 265 billion in annual sales and 20 million units per year 

  

automotive retailing is highly competitive consumers typically have many choices when deciding where to purchase a used or new vehicle in both the used and new vehicle markets carmax seeks to distinguish itself from traditional dealerships through its consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies the company’s primary competitors are the nation’s approximately 21650 franchised new car dealers which sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles carmax also competes with independent dealers and private individuals 

  

the company believes that its principal competitive factors in used vehicle retailing are price breadth of selection including the more popular makes and models quality of vehicles location of retail sites and degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience customer satisfaction is driven by carmax’s customerfriendly sales process the quality of the used cars sold and the services the company provides carmax’s certified quality inspection assures that every vehicle offered for sale at carmax meets stringent mechanical electrical and safety standards upon request by the customer carmax will transfer virtually any used vehicle in the company’s nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfers are free within a market long distance transfers include a charge to cover transportation costs carmax backs every vehicle with a 5day or 250mile moneyback guarantee and a 30day limited warranty other competitive factors include the ability to offer or arrange customer financing on competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of extended service plans carmax believes that it is competitive in all of these areas and that it enjoys advantages over competitors that employ traditional automotive selling methods 

  

carmax’s sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid a commission based on a fixed dollarsperunit standard this ensures that the sales consultant’s primary objective is helping customers find the right cars for their needs at prices they can afford in contrast sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships often receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and for steering customers toward vehicles with higher gross margins 

  

in the new vehicle market carmax competes with other franchised dealers offering vehicles produced by the same or other manufacturers historically the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques the company believes its customerfriendly lowpressure sales methods are points of competitive differentiation 

  

marketing and advertising carmax’s marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at its stores and on attracting customers who are already in the market to buy or sell a vehicle the company uses market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor its marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area carmax’s marketing strategies are implemented primarily through television and radio broadcasts newspaper advertising and wwwcarmaxcom television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to build consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer newspaper advertisements promote carmax’s broad selection of vehicles and price competitiveness targeting consumers with immediate purchase intentions both broadcast and newspaper advertisements are designed to drive customers to its stores and to the carmax website 

  

the company’s website carmaxcom is a marketing tool for communicating the carmax consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online the carmax website offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on the more than 20000 cars available in the carmax nationwide inventory is updated daily carmaxcom includes detailed information such as pictures of each vehicle prices features specifications and store locations as well as sorting and comparison features that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and an option to estimate tradein values via a link with kelley blue book carmax believes these features make it easier for consumers to meet all of their auto research needs on carmaxcom customers can contact sales consultants online via carmaxcom by telephone or by fax customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home including applying for financing and need to visit the store only to sign the paperwork and pick up their vehicle 

  

suppliers for used vehicles carmax acquires its used vehicle inventory directly from customers through its unique appraisal process and through other sources including local and regional auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies the carmax appraisal offer process enables the company to access the private market as its largest source for used vehicle inventory many vehicles purchased directly from consumers are among the highest quality used vehicles available in the market because they have been well maintained by their owners in stores open for more than one year carmax generally acquires a larger portion of its used vehicle inventory directly from customers than from any other source this buying strategy also helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the tastes of the market 

  

carmax has replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which carmaxtrained buyers appraise most vehicles and provide the vehicle’s owner with a written guaranteed cash offer that is good for 7 days or 300 miles whichever is first an appraisal is available to every customer free of charge whether or not the individual purchases a vehicle from carmax because carmax’s operating strategy is to build customer confidence and satisfaction by offering only high quality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through the appraisal process meet the company’s retail standards those vehicles that do not meet the retail standards are sold at the company’s instore auctions 

  

carmax buyers evaluate all used vehicles on the basis of their estimated wholesale value and reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases cost of delivery to the store where they will be reconditioned the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers to decide which inventory to purchase at offsite auctions carmax’s buyers in collaboration with its headquarters staff rely on the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system the company’s inventory and pricing models help the buyers to tailor to the buying preferences at each superstore recommend pricing adjustments and optimize inventory turns to help maintain gross margin dollars per unit 

  

based on consumer acceptance of the appraisal process at existing carmax stores and carmax’s experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources carmax believes that its sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet current needs and to support planned expansion 

  

suppliers for new vehicles carmax operates seven new car franchises under separate agreements with manufacturers new car operations are governed by the terms of the sales and service agreements with daimlerchrysler general motors nissan and toyota these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies a manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances including a change in ownership without prior manufacturer approval failure to maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings or a material breach of other provisions of the agreement carmax also has entered into framework agreements with several major vehicle manufacturers these agreements generally contain provisions relating to the acquisition ownership structure advertising and management of a dealership franchised by those manufacturers 

  

seasonality carmax’s business is seasonal most carmax superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer fiscal quarters sales and gross margins are typically lowest in the fall quarter which coincides with the new vehicle modelyearchangeover period in the fall quarter the new model year introductions and discounting on model year closeouts can cause rapid depreciation in used car pricing particularly for latemodel used cars seasonal patterns for car buying and selling may vary in different parts of the country and as carmax expands geographically these differences could have an effect on the overall seasonal pattern of the company’s results in addition the growth in sales to subprime customers whose buying activity tends to peak early in the tax refund season could modestly affect the seasonality 

  

products and services 

  

merchandising carmax offers its customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported vehicles at competitive prices carmax’s used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler ford general motors honda mitsubishi nissan and toyota and luxury brands such as bmw and lexus the company’s primary focus is vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old have fewer than 60000 miles and generally range in price from 10000 to 31000 each vehicle must pass a comprehensive quality inspection that covers all major and minor mechanical systems and all safety functions as well as cosmetic criteria for the more costconscious consumer the company also offers used cars branded “valumax” that are more than 6 years old or have 60000 miles or more and that generally range in price from 7000 to 21000 these older vehicles must pass a quality inspection covering the major mechanical systems and all safety functions 

  

carmax has implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which it sets “nohaggle” prices on both its used and new vehicles the company believes that its pricing is competitive with the best negotiated prices in the market prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom and in carmax’s newspaper advertising carmax extends its nohaggle philosophy to every component of the vehicle transaction including tradeins financing rates accessories extended service plan pricing and vehicle documentation fees in addition to selling new vehicles using the low “nohaggle” price strategy the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow carmax to sell manufacturers’ brands perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 

  

an integral part of carmax’s used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process this process includes a comprehensive certified quality inspection of the engine cooling and fuel systems drive axle transmission electronic systems suspension brake system steering air conditioning interior and optional equipment based on this quality inspection carmax determines the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to carmax’s high quality standards vehicle inspections are completed by carmax’s mechanics carmax performs most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services carmax engages third parties specializing in those services over the past several years carmax has performed an increasing percentage of reconditioning services inhouse and based on the cost savings realized that trend is expected to continue 

  

service all carmax used car locations provide vehicle repair service including used car extended service plan repairs factoryauthorized service is also provided at all new car franchises carmax has developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that its retail repair service operations are conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as its other operations 

  

carmax believes that the efficiency of its service and reconditioning operations is enhanced by its modern facilities a technician mentoring process and its compensation programs the mentoring process and compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of service technicians and result in reduced costs and higherquality repairs the experienced technicians in each store perform the more complicated repairs with assistance from apprentices who also perform less complex functions on their own each technician receives a flat rate for each repair or service performed carmax is able to track the productivity of each technician through the company’s information system 

  

customer credit carmax provides primerated financing to qualified customers through the company’s own finance operation carmax auto finance and through bank of america offering customers a thirdparty alternative for prime loans enhances the carmax consumer offer and helps to ensure that caf remains competitive in addition daimlerchrysler services general motors acceptance nissan motors acceptance and toyota financial services offer prime financing to qualified customers purchasing new vehicles at applicable carmax locations nonprime financing is offered by transsouth financial wells fargo financial acceptance and americredit financial services subprime financing is offered by drive financial services carmax has tested and will continue to test other thirdparty finance companies in order to expand the choices for its customers and increase discrete approvals

extended service plan sales at the time carmax sells a vehicle it offers the customer an extended service plan currently in all the states in which carmax operates it sells these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties that are the primary obligors under these thirdparty service plan programs carmax has no contractual liability to the customer the extended service plans have terms of coverage from 12 to 72 months carmax offers these extended service plans at low fixed prices all extended service plans sold by carmax other than manufacturers’ warranties have been designed to carmax specifications and are administered by third parties through privatelabel arrangements under which carmax receives a commission from the administrator at the time the extended service plan is sold 

  

all carmax locations provide vehicle repair service including extended service plan repairs carmax’s extended service plan customers also have access to the thirdparty administrators’ nationwide network of approximately 14000 independent service providers carmax believes that the quality of the services provided by this provider network as well as the broad scope of its extended service plans helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

  

systems 

  

carmax’s stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions customers can select a range of vehicles using information kiosks that display their choices and provide a map showing customers where their selections are located on the display lot carmax’s inventory management system tracks every retail vehicle through its carmax life from purchase through reconditioning and test drives to ultimate sale bar codes are placed on each vehicle and on each onsite parking place daily scanning of bar codes tracks the movement of vehicles on the lot an electronic gate on the lot and a radio frequency transmitter on each vehicle helps track vehicle testdrives and sales consultants online financing and computerassisted document preparation ensures rapid completion of the sales transaction behind the scenes carmax’s proprietary store technology provides its management with realtime information about every aspect of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity

overview of business 

  

carmax inc was incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia in 1996 its corporate offices are located at 4900 cox road glen allen va carmax inc is a holding company and its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries 

  

carmax began operations in 1993 under the ownership of circuit city stores inc “circuit city” when it opened its first location in richmond va in fiscal 1997 circuit city created two common stock series circuit city stores inc–circuit city group common stock and circuit city stores inc–carmax group “carmax group” common stock on february 7 1997 circuit city completed an initial public offering of carmax group common stock which was intended to track separately the performance of the carmax operations on october 1 2002 the carmax business was separated from circuit city through a taxfree transaction in which each share of carmax group common stock was exchanged for one share of carmax inc common stock in addition each holder of circuit city group common stock received a distribution of a 0313879 share of carmax inc common stock for each circuit city group share as a result of the separation all of the businesses assets and liabilities of the carmax group are held in carmax inc an independent separately traded public company 

  

carmax is the nation’s largest specialty retailer of used cars and light trucks the company purchases reconditions and sells used vehicles carmax opened a total of 33 used car superstores through fiscal 2000 before slowing its geographic growth to concentrate on improving operations and profitability geographic growth was resumed at the end of fiscal 2002 and through the end of fiscal 2004 an additional 16 used car superstores were opened the company also sells new vehicles under various franchise agreements as planned carmax’s new car sales have become a smaller part of its business mix as it has divested nine new car franchises over the past three fiscal years while aggressively growing its used car business in fiscal 2004 used vehicles represented 91 of the total vehicle units sold by carmax 

  

carmax provides its customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers by offering a broad selection of great quality vehicles at low nohaggle prices in a customerfriendly atmosphere the company has separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions carmax provides an appraisal that allows current vehicle owners to sell their cars to carmax regardless of their intent to purchase a vehicle from the company carmax also provides its customers with a full range of related services including the financing of vehicle purchases through carmax auto finance “caf” and thirdparty lenders the sale of extended warranties accessories and vehicle repair service caf is the company’s own finance operation that offers financing to primerated customers 

  

the carmax process is designed to enable customers to evaluate separately each step of the sales process a la carte and to make informed decisions at each step based on comprehensive information about their options and the associated prices the customer can take or leave any aspect of the offer without affecting the offer on the other steps in the sales process carmax’s nohaggle pricing and its fixeddollarperunit commission structure allows its sales consultants to focus solely on meeting customer needs 

  

industry and competition with calendar year 2003 sales of approximately 366 billion used vehicles make up nearly half of the us auto retail market the largest retail segment of the economy in calendar 2003 there were an estimated 436 million used vehicles sold compared with 167 million new vehicles carmax’s primary market latemodel vehicles that are 1 to 6 years old is estimated at approximately 265 billion in annual sales and 20 million units per year 

  

automotive retailing is highly competitive consumers typically have many choices when deciding where to purchase a used or new vehicle in both the used and new vehicle markets carmax seeks to distinguish itself from traditional dealerships through its consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies the company’s primary competitors are the nation’s approximately 21700 franchised new car dealers which sell the majority of latemodel used vehicles carmax also competes with independent dealers rental companies and private parties 

  

the company believes that its principal competitive factors in used vehicle retailing are price breadth of selection including the more popular makes and models quality of the vehicles location of retail sites and degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience customer satisfaction is driven by carmax’s customerfriendly sales process the quality of the used cars sold and the services the company provides carmax’s certified quality inspection assures that every vehicle offered for sale at carmax meets rigorous mechanical electrical and safety standards upon request by the customer carmax will transfer any used vehicle in the company’s nationwide inventory to a local superstore transfers are free within a market long distance transfers include a charge to cover transportation costs carmax backs every vehicle with a 5day 250mile noquestionsasked moneyback guarantee and a 30day comprehensive warranty other competitive factors include the ability to offer or arrange customer financing on competitive terms and the comprehensiveness and cost of extended warranties carmax believes that it is competitive in all of these areas and that it enjoys advantages over competitors that employ traditional selling methods 

  

carmax’s sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process a sales consultant is paid the same fixeddollarperunit commission on any vehicle sold so the sales consultant’s only objective is helping customers find the right car for their needs at a price they can afford in contrast sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships often receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and for steering customers toward vehicles with higher gross margins 

  

in the new vehicle market carmax competes with other franchised dealers offering vehicles produced by the same or other manufacturers and with auto brokers and leasing companies historically the new vehicle market has been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques the company believes its customerfriendly lowpressure sales methods are points of competitive differentiation 

  

marketing and advertising carmax’s marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at its stores attracting customers who are already in the market to buy or sell a vehicle and targeting specific segments of the market through special promotions the company uses market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor its marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area carmax’s marketing strategies are implemented primarily through newspaper television and radio advertising and its web site wwwcarmaxcom television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to enhance consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer newspaper advertisements promote carmax’s broad selection of vehicles and price leadership targeting consumers with immediate purchase intentions both broadcast and newspaper advertisements are designed to drive customers to its stores and to the carmax web site 

  

the third major marketing tool for carmax is its web site carmaxcom which is a marketing tool for communicating its consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online the carmax web site offers complete inventory and pricing search capabilities information on the more than 20000 cars available in the carmax nationwide inventory is updated daily carmaxcom includes detailed information such as pictures of each vehicle prices features specifications and store locations as well as sorting and comparison features that allow consumers to easily compare vehicles the site also includes features such as detailed vehicle reviews payment calculators and an option to estimate tradein values via a link with kelley blue book carmax believes these features make it easier for consumers to meet all of their auto research needs on carmaxcom both used car and new car customers can contact sales consultants online via carmaxcom by telephone or by fax customers can work with these sales consultants from the comfort of home including applying for financing and only need to visit the store to sign the paperwork and pick up their vehicle 

  

carmax also targets specific segments of the used vehicle market through special promotions such promotions may focus on a particular type of vehicle eg “minivan month” or a particular price point eg 9999 or less for a large number of vehicles carmax’s marketing staff closely coordinates with the purchasing departments at the locations conducting the promotions to ensure that appropriate quantities of targeted inventory are purchased and displayed thus maximizing the benefits of the promotion 

  

suppliers for used vehicles carmax acquires its used vehicle inventory directly from customers through its unique appraisal process and through other sources including local and regional auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies carmax believes that the appraisal offer process enables it to access the private market as a significant additional source for used vehicle inventory many vehicles purchased directly from consumers are among the highest quality used vehicles available in the market because they have been well maintained by their owners in stores open for more than 1 year carmax generally acquires a larger portion of its used vehicle inventory from customers than from any other source this buying strategy helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects the tastes of the market 

  

carmax has replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which carmaxtrained buyers appraise any vehicle and provide the vehicle’s owner with a written guaranteed cash offer that is good for 7 days or 300 miles whichever is first an appraisal is available to everyone free of charge whether or not the individual purchases a vehicle from carmax the carmax sales process is different from that of traditional dealers who usually combine the vehicle purchase and tradein transactions as well as the financing the sale of extended warranties and other addons the carmax sales process allows the customer to separately evaluate and make an informed decision on each individual component of the sales transaction because carmax’s operating strategy is to build customer confidence and satisfaction by offering only high quality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through the appraisal process meet the company’s retail standards those vehicles that do not meet the retail standards are sold at the company’s onsite wholesale auctions 

  

the carmax buyers evaluate all used vehicles on the basis of their wholesale value and reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases cost of delivery to the store where they will be reconditioned the inventory purchasing function is primarily performed at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers to decide which inventory to purchase carmax’s buyers in collaboration with its headquarters staff rely on the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system 

  

based on consumer acceptance of the appraisal process at existing carmax stores and carmax’s experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources carmax believes that its sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet current needs and to support planned expansion 

  

suppliers for new vehicles carmax operates new car dealerships under separate franchise or dealer agreements with manufacturers new car operations for the franchise locations is governed by the terms of the sales and service agreements with daimlerchrysler ford general motors mitsubishi nissan and toyota these agreements generally impose operating requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies a manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances including a change in ownership without prior manufacturer approval failure to maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings or a material breach of other provisions of the agreement carmax also has entered into framework agreements with several major vehicle manufacturers these agreements generally contain provisions relating to the acquisition ownership structure advertising and management of a dealership franchised by those manufacturers 

  

seasonality carmax’s business is seasonal most carmax superstores experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer fiscal quarters sales and gross margins are typically lowest in the fall quarter which is the new vehicle modelyearchangeover period in the fall quarter the new model year introductions and discounting on model year closeouts can cause rapid depreciation in used car pricing particularly for latemodel used cars seasonal patterns for car buying and selling may vary in different parts of the country and as carmax expands geographically these differences could have an effect on the overall seasonal pattern of the company’s results 

  

products and services 

  

merchandising carmax offers its customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported cars and light trucks at competitive prices carmax’s used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler ford general motors honda mitsubishi nissan and toyota and luxury brands such as bmw and lexus the company’s primary focus is vehicles that are generally less than six years old have fewer than 60000 miles and generally range in price from 9500 to 29000 each vehicle must pass a comprehensive quality inspection that covers all major and minor mechanical systems and all safety functions as well as cosmetic criteria for the more cost conscious consumer the company also offers used cars branded “valumax” that are more than six years old or have 60000 miles or more and that 

  

generally range in price from 6500 to 19000 these older vehicles must pass a quality inspection covering the major mechanical systems and all safety functions and concentration is placed on providing good basic mechanically sound transportation in some instances cosmetic corrections may not be made to these older “valumax” cars 

  

carmax has implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which it sets “nohaggle” prices on its used and new vehicles the company believes that its pricing is competitive with the best negotiated prices in the market prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom and in carmax’s newspaper advertising carmax extends its nohaggle philosophy to every stage of the vehicle transaction including tradeins financing rates accessories extended warranty pricing and vehicle documentation fees in addition to selling new vehicles using the “nohaggle” low price strategy the franchise and dealer agreements generally allow carmax to sell manufacturers’ brands perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory 

  

an integral part of carmax’s used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process this process includes a comprehensive certified quality inspection of the engine cooling and fuel systems drive axle transmission electronic systems suspension brake system steering air conditioning interior and optional equipment based on this quality inspection carmax determines the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to carmax’s high quality standards vehicle inspections are completed by carmax’s mechanics carmax performs most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services carmax engages third parties specializing in those services over the past several years carmax has performed an increasing percentage of reconditioning services inhouse and based on the cost savings realized that trend is expected to continue 

  

service all carmax used car locations provide vehicle repair service including used car extended warranty service factoryauthorized service is also provided at all new car franchises carmax has developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that its retail repair service operations are conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as its other operations 

  

carmax believes that the efficiency of its service and reconditioning operations are enhanced by its modern facilities a technician mentoring process and its compensation programs the mentoring process and compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of service technicians and result in reduced costs and higherquality repairs and reconditioning the experienced technicians in each store perform the more complicated repairs with assistance from apprentices who also perform simpler functions on their own each technician receives a flat rate for each repair or service performed carmax is able to track the productivity of each technician through the company’s information system 

  

customer credit carmax offers financing for primerated customers through its own finance operation carmax auto finance and through bank of america in some cases where the used vehicle is a certified used vehicle the manufacturer may also provide primerated customers an offer offering customers a thirdparty alternative for prime loans enhances the carmax consumer offer and helps to ensure that caf remains competitive caf also reduces the sales risk associated with changes in thirdparty credit availability in addition chrysler financial ford motor credit general motors acceptance mitsubishi motors credit nissan motors acceptance and toyota financial services offer prime financing to customers purchasing new vehicles at applicable carmax locations financing for nonprime rated customers is offered by transsouth financial wells fargo financial acceptance and americredit financial services with no financial recourse to carmax in addition carmax has tested and will continue to test other thirdparty lenders in order to expand the choices for its customers and increase discrete approvals sales consultants use carmax’s proprietary information system to electronically submit financing applications and receive responses often from multiple lenders generally in less than five minutes from prime lenders financings are installment sale contracts secured by the vehicles financed customers are permitted to refinance their loans within three business days of a purchase without incurring any finance or related charges generally carmax’s arrangements with its thirdparty lenders provide for payment of a fee to carmax at the time of financing provided the loan is not refinanced within 90 days carmax has no recourse liability on used car loans arranged with thirdparty lenders 

  

extended warranty sales at the time carmax sells a vehicle it offers the customer an extended warranty currently in all the states in which carmax operates it sells warranties on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors under these thirdparty warranty programs carmax has no contractual liability contracts usually have terms of coverage between 12 and 72 months carmax offers these extended warranties at low fixed prices all extended warranties sold by carmax other than manufacturers’ warranties have been designed to carmax specifications and are administered by a third party through a privatelabel arrangement under which carmax receives a fee from the administrator at the time the extended warranty is sold 

  

all carmax locations provide vehicle repair service including extended warranty service carmax’s extended warranty customers also have access to the thirdparty administrator’s nationwide network of approximately 14000 independent service providers carmax believes that the quality of the services provided by this provider network as well as the broad scope of its extended warranties helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

  

systems 

  

carmax’s stores are supported by an advanced information system that improves the customer experience while providing tightly integrated automation of all operating functions customers can select a range of vehicles using information kiosks that display their choices and provide a map showing customers where their selections are parked on the display lot carmax’s inventory management system includes bar codes on each vehicle and each onsite parking place daily scanning of bar codes tracks the movement of vehicles on the lot an electronic gate on the lot and a radio frequency transmitter on each vehicle helps track testdrives for vehicles and sales consultants online financing and computerassisted document preparation ensures rapid completion of the sales transaction behind the scenes carmax’s proprietary store technology provides its management with realtime information about every aspect of store operations such as inventory management pricing vehicle transfers wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity

general  carmax is the nation’s largest specialty retailer of used cars and light trucks in 1993 carmax pioneered the used car superstore concept when it opened its first location in richmond virginia carmax purchases reconditions and sells used vehicles in addition carmax sells new vehicles under franchise agreements with daimlerchrysler mitsubishi nissan toyota ford and general motors carmax provides its customers the opportunity to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for items at other “bigbox” retailers by offering a broad selection of great quality vehicles at low nohaggle prices in a customerfriendly atmosphere carmax has separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions carmax provides an appraisal that allows current vehicle owners to sell their cars to carmax regardless of their intent to purchase a vehicle from the company carmax also provides its customers with a full range of related services including the financing of vehicle purchases through its own finance operation and thirdparty lenders the sale of extended warranties and vehicle repair service 

  

store formats  carmax conducts its operations in three basic retail formats currently our growth plan calls for the construction of standard superstores and satellite superstores existing standard superstores are approximately 40000 to 60000 square feet on 10 to 25 acres with approximately 20 to 35 service bays existing satellite superstores are approximately 10000 to 20000 square feet on 4 to 7 acres with approximately 3 to 9 service bays existing mega superstores are approximately 70000 to 95000 square feet on 20 to 35 acres with approximately 35 to 45 service bays 

  

expansion  carmax has established a strong foundation for future growth based upon its unique knowledge of the used car market its established presence in key locations and its ability to execute its business plan in a market subject to continuous change over the last five years carmax has refined its operating strategies and has emerged as the nation’s leading specialty retailer of used cars and light trucks in the united states carmax believes that it is wellpositioned to succeed in the highly competitive automotive retail industry specifically carmax has enhanced its ability to identify profitable markets determine the appropriate store formats to fit those markets and effectively manage pricing and inventory mix 

  

since 1997 carmax has modified and reestablished its newstore growth model to move away from largeformat mega superstores despite the success of its initial mega superstores in norcross ga and laurel md in its subsequent stores in the los angeles miami tampa houston dallas and chicago markets this format proved less effective from a profitability perspective carmax found that customers in these metropolitan markets were not as willing to travel great distances to its mega superstores resulting in stores that were too large and that underserved the trade area consequently carmax is expanding its number of stores by adding standard superstores in new midsized markets that can be served effectively with one carmax 

  

  

superstore together with satellite superstores in existing multistore markets in addition based upon the initial success of our test of adding a satellite store in a fully developed midsized market in charlotte nc carmax intends to expand testing whether increased penetration may be achieved by adding a satellite superstore in additional midsize markets carmax believes that by focusing on midsized markets and satellite fillin superstores over the near term it can achieve a higher return on its investment with lower risk this approach also allows carmax to postpone entering large multistore markets until its hubandsatellite fillin store strategy in existing large multistore markets has matured further and provides carmax the opportunity to better anticipate the number location and types of stores that will be required in such markets 

  

under the hubandsatellite fillin store strategy a satellite superstore uses the reconditioning purchasing management and business office operations of a nearby fullsized hub superstore the consumer offer is identical in both hub superstores and satellite superstores these hub stores have service facilities that provide regular maintenance and warranty service typical of most new car dealerships and also recondition all used vehicles prior to sale at both the hub superstore and any related satellite superstore 

  

during fiscal 2003 carmax opened a total of five superstores in addition to one standardsized superstore originally planned in fiscal 2003 but opened in march 2003 carmax plans to open approximately four standardsized used car superstores and three prototype satellite superstores in fiscal 2004 carmax may also open an eighth store in the fourth quarter in april of fiscal 2004 carmax sold its jeep franchise in kenosha wis also in fiscal 2004 carmax plans to sell its five mitsubishi new car franchises the sale of the mitsubishi franchises which are integrated with used car superstores will create more space for used car sales expansion which is more profitable for the company in addition in los angeles the company intends to integrate the two remaining standalone new car franchises with a used car superstore during the second half of fiscal 2004 

  

carmax expects midsized markets to provide much of its future growth in the next few years carmax has defined “midsized market” as a market with a televisionviewing population of approximately 10 to 25 million people carmax is currently in twelve midsized markets including richmond raleigh charlotte orlando san antonio greenville sc nashville greensboro knoxville sacramento las vegas and kansas city carmax believes that more than 30 additional midsized markets may be suitable for its standard store prototype carmax believes that focusing on midsized markets enhances its sales growth and profitability site selection and real estate acquisition typically are simpler in midsized markets establishing consumer awareness also is easier in a midsized market because all forms of media can be used economically to achieve broad consumer reach as a result carmax’s stores in midsized markets generally exceed the company’s average return on investment 

  

in addition to entering new midsized markets carmax plans to focus on adding satellite fillin superstores in underserved trade areas in its existing multistore markets which include washingtonbaltimore chicago atlanta dallas houston miami and tampa carmax has identified approximately 10 underserved trade areas to target in these markets carmax is focusing on the addition of satellite fillin superstores in existing markets because satellite superstores leverage existing facilities and management in those markets satellite superstores present the same consumer offer including size of inventory on onehalf to onethird the acreage of a standard superstore and satellite superstores require little or no incremental advertising the four prototype satellite superstores opened in multistore markets for more than twelve months located in rockville md plano tex houston tex and merrillville ind chicago market were profitable in their first year 

  

carmax expects that its business strategies will help it improve its sales growth and enhance its profit margins 

  

merchandising  carmax offers its customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles including both domestic and imported cars and light trucks at competitive prices carmax’s used car selection covers popular brands from manufacturers such as daimlerchrysler ford general motors honda mitsubishi nissan and toyota and specialty brands like bmw and lexus to appeal to the vast array of consumer preferences and budgets carmax offers used vehicles under two programs – the carmax program and the valumax program carmax used cars are less than six years old have fewer than 60000 miles and generally range in price from 9000 to 28000 each carmax vehicle must pass a comprehensive quality inspection that covers all major and minor mechanical systems and all safety functions as well as cosmetic criteria valumax used cars are more than six years old or have 60000 miles or more and generally range in price from 6000 to 16000 each valumax vehicle must pass a quality inspection covering the major mechanical systems and all safety functions for valumax concentration is placed on providing good basic mechanically sound transportation cosmetic corrections or repairs of convenience or luxury items such as electric mirrors or electric antennas may not be made 

  

at all new car locations a full selection of the manufacturer’s models related to the franchise is available carmax operates new car dealerships under separate franchise or dealer agreements with daimlerchrysler mitsubishi nissan toyota ford and general motors 

  

carmax has implemented an everyday lowprice strategy under which carmax sets “nohaggle” prices on its used and new vehicles in fiscal 2003 its retail used car prices were on average 1500 below retail kelley blue book price carmax believes most prices are at or below the best negotiated price in the market prices on all vehicles are clearly displayed on each vehicle’s information sticker on carmaxcom and in carmax’s newspaper advertising carmax has extended its nohaggle philosophy to 

  

  

every stage of the vehicle transaction including tradeins financing rates accessories extended warranty pricing and its low vehicle documentation fees 

  

suppliers  carmax acquires its used vehicle inventory directly from customers through its unique appraisal process and through other sources including local and regional auctions wholesalers franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners such as leasing companies and rental companies generally in stores open for more than one year carmax acquires a larger portion of its used vehicle inventory from customers than from any other source this buying strategy provides an inventory of makes and models that reflects the tastes of the market 

  

carmax has replaced the traditional “tradein” transaction with a process in which carmax trained buyers appraise any vehicle usually in 30 minutes or less and provide the vehicle’s owner with a written guaranteed cash offer that is good for seven days or 300 miles an appraisal is available to everyone free of charge whether or not the individual is purchasing a vehicle from carmax in contrast to traditional dealers who seek to combine the vehicle purchase and tradein transactions the carmax sales process enables the customer to separately evaluate and make an informed decision with respect to each transaction also carmax believes that this process enables it to access the private market as a significant additional source for used vehicles in addition many vehicles purchased directly from consumers are among the highest quality used vehicles available in the market because they have been maintained by their owners because carmax’s operating strategy is to build customer confidence and satisfaction by offering only high quality vehicles fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through the appraisal process meet the carmax retail standard those vehicles that do not meet the standards are sold at the company’s onsite wholesale auctions 

  

all used vehicles are evaluated on the basis of their wholesale and reconditioning costs and for offsite purchases cost of delivery to the store where they will be reconditioned the inventory purchasing function is primarily done at the store level and is the responsibility of the buyers carmax’s buyers in collaboration with its headquarters staff rely on the extensive inventory and sales trend data available through the carmax information system to purchase inventory 

  

based on consumer acceptance of the appraisal process at existing carmax stores and carmax’s experience and success to date in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources carmax believes that its sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet current needs and to support planned expansion 

  

new car inventory for the franchise locations is governed by the terms of the sales and service agreements with daimlerchrysler mitsubishi nissan toyota ford and general motors for further discussion regarding these agreements see “ franchises ” on page 7 of this form 10k 

  

reconditioning  an integral part of carmax’s used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process this process includes a comprehensive certified quality inspection of the engine cooling and fuel systems drive axle transmission electronic systems suspension brake system steering air conditioning interior and optional equipment based on this quality inspection carmax determines the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to carmax’s high quality standards cars in the valumax program must meet the same mechanical electrical and safety standards but fewer cosmetic and optional equipment standards vehicle inspections are completed by carmax’s mechanics 

  

carmax performs most routine mechanical and minor body repairs inhouse however for some reconditioning services carmax engages third parties specializing in those services over the past several years carmax has been performing an increasing percentage of reconditioning services inhouse and based on the cost savings realized carmax expects that trend to continue 

  

during fiscal 2003 carmax introduced the electronic repair order system or “ero” which drives the sequencing of reconditioning procedures carmax expects ero to reduce cycle time provide information that will help increase quality and reduce costs further enhancing service and profitability 

  

service  all carmax used car locations provide vehicle repair service including used car warranty service factoryauthorized service is also provided at all new car franchises in fiscal 2001 carmax expanded its retail service operations as its customer base increased in fiscal 2002 and 2003 carmax continued its retail service expansion through additional marketing and growth in its customer base carmax has developed systems and procedures that are intended to ensure that its retail repair service operations are conducted in the same customerfriendly and efficient manner as its other operations also in fiscal 2003 carmax implemented the ero system which will provide a foundation for further retail service expansion 

  

carmax believes that the efficiency of its service and reconditioning operations are enhanced by its use of technician support groups as well as by its compensation programs these support groups and compensation programs are designed to increase the productivity of its service technicians and result in reduced costs and higherquality repairs and reconditioning each group contains a small number of service professionals with different skills and levels of experience the experienced technicians in the group perform the more complicated repairs with assistance from the apprentices who also perform simpler functions on their own rather than paying technicians on an hourly basis each technician receives a flat rate for each repair or service performed carmax is able to track the productivity of each technician through the carmax information system 

  

  

carmax places special emphasis on attracting developing and retaining qualified technicians and believes that its favorable working conditions and compensation programs allow it to attract and retain highly qualified technicians in each market carmax enters carmax also has implemented an apprentice training program in an effort to provide a stable future supply of qualified technicians all technicians attend inhouse training programs designed to develop their skills in performing routine repair services on the diverse makes and models of vehicles carmax sells technicians at carmax’s new car franchises also attend manufacturersponsored training programs to stay abreast of current diagnostic repair and maintenance techniques for those manufacturers’ vehicles in addition using technician support groups allows for greater onthejob training opportunities for new technicians 

  

extended warranty sales  at the time carmax sells a vehicle it offers to sell to the customer an extended warranty currently in all the states in which carmax operates it sells warranties on behalf of unrelated third parties who are the primary obligors under these thirdparty warranty programs carmax has no contractual liability contracts usually have terms of coverage between 12 and 72 months carmax offers these extended warranties at low fixed prices all extended warranties carmax sells other than manufacturers’ warranties have been designed to its specifications and are administered by a third party through a privatelabel arrangement under which carmax receives a fee from the administrator at the time the extended warranty is sold carmax offers extended warranties on carmax program vehicles and power train extended warranties on valumax program vehicles 

  

all carmax used car locations provide vehicle repair service including warranty service carmax’s extended warranty customers also have access to an additional 14000 independent service providers nationwide carmax believes that the quality of the services provided by this provider network as well as the broad scope of its extended warranties helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business 

  

marketing and advertising  carmax’s marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at carmax attracting customers who are already in the market to purchase a vehicle and targeting specific segments of the market through special promotions carmax’s marketing strategies are implemented primarily through newspaper television and radio advertising and carmaxcom television and radio broadcast advertisements are designed to enhance consumer awareness of the carmax name carmaxcom and key components of the carmax offer newspaper advertisements promote carmax’s broad selection of vehicles and price leadership targeting consumers with immediate purchase intentions both broadcast and newspaper advertisements are designed to drive customers to its stores and to the carmax web site the style and substance of carmax’s advertisements are distinctly different from those placed by most automobile dealers the third major marketing support for carmax is its web site carmaxcom which acts as a marketing tool for communicating its consumer offer in detail a sophisticated search engine for finding the right vehicle and a sales channel for customers who prefer to complete a part of the shopping and sales process online with one of carmax’s internet sales consultants 

  

in fiscal 2001 carmax further refined its advertising approach by eliminating spending that its research showed to be unprofitable and by increasing the efficiency of its television advertising in fiscal 2002 and 2003 carmax continued to refine its advertising approach implemented in fiscal 2001 carmax employs a targeted high frequency lowcostperimpression television strategy coupled with more targeted newspaper advertising advertising expenditures were 13 of net sales and operating revenues in both fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 and 16 of net sales and operating revenues in fiscal 2001 carmax’s fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 advertising expense ratios reflect leverage from the total and comparable store sales increases and changes in media buying strategy 

  

carmax also targets specific segments of the used vehicle market through special promotions such promotions may focus on a particular type of vehicle eg “minivan month” or a particular price point eg 9999 or less for a large number of vehicles promotions are closely coordinated by carmax’s marketing staff with purchasing departments at selected locations to ensure that appropriate quantities of targeted inventory are purchased and displayed thus maximizing the benefits of the promotion 

  

carmax utilizes market awareness and customer satisfaction surveys to help tailor its marketing efforts to the purchasing habits and preferences of customers in each market area in multistore markets carmax expects to leverage its advertising expense 

  

franchises  carmax operates new car dealerships under separate franchise or dealer agreements with manufacturers these agreements generally allow carmax to sell manufacturers’ brands perform warranty work on these vehicles and sell related parts and services within a specified market area designation of specified market areas generally does not guarantee exclusivity within a specified territory these agreements generally impose operational requirements and restrictions including inventory levels working capital monthly financial reporting signage and cooperation with marketing strategies a manufacturer may terminate a dealer agreement under certain circumstances including a change in ownership without prior manufacturer approval failure to maintain adequate customer satisfaction ratings or a material breach of other provisions of the agreement carmax also has entered into framework agreements with several major vehicle manufacturers these agreements generally contain provisions relating to the acquisition ownership structure advertising and management of a dealership franchised by those manufacturers 

  

  

  

various us federal and state laws governing the relationship between automotive dealerships and vehicle manufacturers also might affect carmax these laws include statutes prohibiting manufacturers from terminating or failing to renew franchise agreements without proper cause and unreasonably withholding approval for proposed ownership changes 

  

competition  the used and new car retail business is highly competitive consumers typically have many choices when deciding where to purchase a used or new vehicle in both the used and new vehicle markets carmax seeks to distinguish itself from traditional dealerships through its consumer offer sales approach and other innovative operating strategies the company’s largest competition is franchised new dealerships which sell the majority of late model used vehicles carmax also competes with independent dealers rental companies and private parties 

  

carmax believes that the principal competitive factors in used vehicle sales are price ability to offer a wide selection of vehicles including the more popular makes and models quality of the vehicles location of retail sites and degree of customer satisfaction with the carbuying experience other competitive factors include the ability to offer or arrange customer financing on competitive terms and the quality and cost of primary and extended warranties carmax believes that it is competitive in all of these areas and enjoys advantages over competitors that employ traditional selling methods 

  

in the new vehicle market carmax competes with other franchised dealers offering vehicles produced by the same or other manufacturers and with auto brokers and leasing companies carmax believes that the principal competitive factors in new vehicle sales are price dealer sales promotions ability of dealerships to offer a wide selection of the most popular vehicles location of retail sites and quality of customer service the new vehicle market has historically been served primarily by dealerships employing traditional highpressure negotiationoriented sales techniques carmax believes that its customerfriendly lowpressure sales methods produce points of competitive differentiation in which it may have an advantage however because the new car business does not provide the opportunity to add as much value as the used car business the company is reducing the number of new car franchises it operates 

  

customer satisfaction  the carmax process is designed to enable customers to evaluate separately each step of the sales process a la carte and to make informed decisions at each step based on comprehensive information about their options and the associated prices the customer can take or leave any aspect of the offer without impacting the offer on the other steps in the sales process to increase efficiency the same sales consultant and the customerfriendly proprietary carmax inventory information system are available to assist the customer throughout the carmax sales process carmax designed the elements of the carmax offer to create a customerfriendly experience carmax’s nohaggle pricing allows its sales consultants to focus solely on its customers’ needs the entire purchase process including a testdrive and financing can be completed in less than one hour carmax conducts extensive market research to measure its customer service record and to refine its consumer offer 

  

carmax’s sales consultants play a significant role in ensuring a customerfriendly sales process carmax places great emphasis on integrity and customerrelations skills in its hiring policies and training programs although few of carmax’s sales consultants have had prior experience in automobile sales most of carmax’s sales consultants have had prior retail experience outside the auto business before joining carmax sales consultants including both full and parttime employees are compensated on a commission basis the sales consultants’ incentives are aligned with the customer’s interests a sales consultant is paid the same fixed dollar commission on any vehicle sold so the sales consultants’ only objective is helping customers find the vehicles they want at a price they can afford in contrast sales and finance personnel at traditional dealerships often receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and for steering customers toward vehicles with higher gross margins 

  

customer satisfaction is also driven by the quality of the used cars sold and the services the company provides carmax’s certified quality inspection assures that every car offered for sale at carmax meets rigorous mechanical electrical and safety standards carmax backs every car with a fiveday or 250mile “noquestionsasked” moneyback guarantee and an industryleading 30day limited warranty 

  

training  carmax is committed to providing exceptional training to its associates new store associates are offered structured selfpaced training programs that introduce them to company policies and their specific job responsibilities associate participation and performance in each training program are measured by an intranetbased testing and tracking system most new associates are assigned mentors who provide onthejob guidance and support many of carmax’s compensation programs reward associates for continuously improving their skills
