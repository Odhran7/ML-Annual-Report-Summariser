distribution segment 

our distribution segment consists of our distribution and display assembly operations and generates its revenues primarily from the distribution of packaging products and assembly of display products we distribute 

 

corrugated packaging materials and other specialty packaging products including stretch film void fill carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes through our network of warehouses and distribution facilities we also provide contract packing services such as multiproduct promotional packing and product manipulation such as multipacks and onpacks sales in our distribution segment to external customers accounted for 66 67 and 63 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information 

land and development segment 

during fiscal 2020 we completed the monetization of the various real estate holdings that we owned that were concentrated in the charleston sc region sales in our land and development segment to external customers accounted for 01 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 following completion of the monetization of these assets we ceased reporting the results of the land and development segment as a separate segment see “ note 7 segment information ” for additional information 

seasonality 

while our businesses are not materially impacted by seasonality there is some variability in demand that occurs from quarter to quarter with net sales in the first quarter of each fiscal year typically being the lowest as such we disclose net sales adjusted ebitda as hereinafter defined and shipment data by segment by quarter in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” generally we expect more of our earnings and cash flows to be generated in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half of the fiscal year due to these variations and other factors including the timing of scheduled mill maintenance outages 

raw materials 

the primary raw materials used by our mill operations are recycled fiber at our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills and virgin fiber from hardwoods and softwoods at our virgin containerboard and paperboard mills certain of our virgin containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content our overall fiber sourcing for all of our mills is approximately 65 virgin and 35 recycled see “ item 2 properties ” for additional information recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate significantly recycled fiber and virgin fiber costs increased significantly in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

containerboard and paperboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations our converting operations use many different grades of containerboard and paperboard we supply substantially all of our converting operations needs for containerboard and paperboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps with other manufacturers these arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs because there are other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of containerboard and paperboard used in our converting operations we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from other suppliers in the event that we incur production disruptions for recycled or virgin containerboard and paperboard see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ”  

energy 

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas coal oil electricity and wood byproducts biomass at times has fluctuated significantly in our coated and uncoated recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity to generate steam used in the paper making process in our integrated kraft paper mills we use natural gas biomass fuel oil and some coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates energy costs increased significantly in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 see item 1 “ business — governmental regulation — environmental ” for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ”  see also item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — 

 

“energy” and “derivative instruments  forward contracts” for additional information regarding our energy consumption 

transportation 

inbound and outbound freight is a significant cost for us factors that influence our freight expense are distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from our facilities to our customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs we experienced higher freight costs and some distribution delays in both fiscal 2022 and 2021 the principal markets for our products are in north america south america europe asia and australia see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ”  

sales and marketing 

none of our external customers individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 we generally manufacture our products pursuant to our customers’ orders we believe that we have good relationships with our customers see item 1a “ risk factors — we depend on certain large customers ”  

as a result of our vertical integration our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products during fiscal 2022 approximately twothirds of our coated natural kraft tons shipped approximately threefifths of our coated recycled paperboard tons shipped and approximately onefifth of our bleached paperboard tons shipped were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture folding cartons and approximately fourfifths of our containerboard tons shipped including trade swaps and buysell transactions were delivered to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products the mill owned by our seven hills paperboard llc “ seven hills ” joint venture in lynchburg va manufactures gypsum paperboard liner for sale to our joint venture partner under the terms of our seven hills joint venture arrangement our joint venture partner is required to purchase all of the qualifying gypsum paperboard liner produced by seven hills excluding the production from seven hills and from our aurora il mill which is converted into book covers and other products approximately onethird of our specialty recycled paperboard tons shipped in fiscal 2022 were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture interior partitions we have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our operations we believe that our ability to leverage our full portfolio of differentiated solutions and capabilities enables us to set ourselves apart from our competitors 

we market our products primarily through our own sales force we also market a number of our products through independent sales representatives and independent distributors we generally pay our sales personnel a combination of base salary commissions and annual bonus we pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis orders from our customers generally do not have significant lead times we discuss foreign net sales to unaffiliated customers and other nonus operations’ financial and other segment information in “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

competition 

we operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large well established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions including industry capacity changes global competition economic conditions in the united states “ us ” and abroad as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and no single company dominates any of those industries our containerboard and paperboard operations compete with integrated and nonintegrated national and regional companies operating primarily in north america and to a limited extent manufacturers outside of north america our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies in the corrugated packaging and folding carton markets we compete with a significant number of national regional and local packaging suppliers in north america and abroad in the solid fiber interior packaging promotional pointofpurchase display and converted paperboard products markets we primarily compete with a smaller number of national regional and local companies offering highly specialized products 

 

since all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly discuss sales opportunities for new business or for renewal of existing business with customers our packaging products compete with packaging made from other materials including plastics the primary competitive factors we face include price design product innovation quality service and sustainability with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences our machinery solutions represent one example of how we compete by providing differentiated solutions that create value for our customers we believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and we obtain feedback on our performance with periodic customer surveys among other means 

the industries in which we operate have undergone consolidation within the packaging products industry larger customers with an expanded geographic presence have tended to seek suppliers that can because of their broad geographic presence efficiently and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs in addition our customers continue to demand higher quality products meeting stricter quality control requirements increasing demand for more sustainable products is also impacting our industry see item 1 “ business — sustainability ” for additional information 

see item 1a “ risk factors — we face intense competition ” and “risk factors — we have been and may be in the future adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ”  

governmental regulation 

health and safety 

our business involves the use of heavy equipment machinery and chemicals and requires the performance of activities that create safety exposures the health and safety of our team members is our most important responsibility and our goal is to create a 100 safe work environment for our team members our safety strategy focuses on people process prevention and performance we seek to reduce exposures and eliminate life changing events through engagement execution of targeted resultsdriven activities and implementation of systems that promote continuous improvement our commitment to safety is reinforced by our use of the westrock safety excellence management system a robust safety program and training curriculum 

we are subject to a broad range of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety and our safety program includes measures required for compliance we have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures to meet our health and safety compliance requirements as well as to continually improve our safety systems we believe that future compliance with occupational health and safety laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the global impact of the covid19 pandemic “ covid ” has affected our operational and financial performance to varying degrees the extent of the effects of future public health crises including a resurgence of covid or related containment measures and government responses are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

certain governmental authorities in locations where we do business have established asbestos standards for the workplace although we do not use asbestos in manufacturing our products asbestos containing material “ acm ” is present in some of the facilities we own or lease for those facilities where acm is present and acm is subject to regulation we have established procedures for properly managing it 

environmental 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business our manufacturing processes involve discharges to water air emissions water intake and waste handling and disposal activities these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various governmental authorities 

we estimate that we will invest approximately 36 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2023 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions 

 

and project completion dates may change and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects or changes in environmental laws and regulations 

see “ note 17 commitments and contingencies — environmental ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see item 1a “ risk factors — we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs ” 

sustainability 

 

at westrock we say sustainability is in every fiber of our company our vision imagining and delivering on the promise of a sustainable future  is represented by three pillars 

▪ supporting people and communities 

▪ bettering the planet 

▪ innovating for our customers and their customers 

our recycling operations bring the process full circle by collecting recovered fiber that is used by our own paper mills and by others to produce new paper products we have a long history of recycling and are one of the largest recyclers in the paper industry 

all of our north american virgin fiber sourcing regions are certified to the sustainable forestry initiative sfi® fiber sourcing standard our forestland in brazil is certified to the brazilian forest certification programme cerflor® the programme for the endorsement of forest certification pefc® and the forest stewardship council fsc® to provide traceability for the virgin fiber used in our operations we have certified more than 95 percent of our wholly owned fiberbased manufacturing facilities to three internationally recognized chainofcustody standards sfi® pefc® and fsc® 

climate change 

 

sustainability and innovation are fundamental to our vision to become the world’s best paper and packaging company and we are working to improve the carbon footprint of our manufacturing operations by setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas “ ghg ” emissions and developing projects to become more energy efficient our integrated kraft paper mills our most energyintensive manufacturing facilities currently burn renewable biomass to generate more than 60 percent of their energy needs most of these facilities also selfgenerate the steam and electricity needed for their manufacturing processes using efficient combined heat and power or “cogeneration” systems during fiscal 2022 our recycling operations helped to divert approximately seven million tons of paper and packaging that might otherwise go into landfills where it might otherwise degrade and release ghgs our fiber procurement activities create economic incentives for landowners and family tree farmers to maintain their holdings as working forests that sequester carbon and provide many other environmental benefits including protection for fresh water supplies and habitats for diverse species of plants and animals 

 

governance 

 

boardlevel oversight of climate and other sustainability matters resides with the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board of directors and six members of the board of directors have sustainability experience 

 

in addition to boardlevel oversight we augmented our managementlevel oversight of sustainability matters during fiscal 2022 westrock’s executive leadership team has responsibility for establishing our sustainability strategy including with respect to climaterelated issues in fiscal 2022 we hired a new senior vice president of strategy and sustainability who reports to our president global paper and is responsible for providing guidance on our sustainability strategy and driving implementation of our sustainability strategy throughout the organization in collaboration with other executives our vice president sustainability manages daytoday implementation of this strategy in addition to our sustainability executives we have established crossfunctional groups within the organization to provide input on our sustainability strategy develop plans to achieve our sustainability targets and embed our sustainability goals into our operations these groups include representatives from our product stewardship environmental innovation engineering manufacturing finance legal and communication groups 

 

 

targets and metrics 

 

in 2015 we established a goal to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions per ton of production by 20 from a 2015 baseline by 2025 as of our september 30 2021 reporting we achieved a reduction of 15 of ghg per ton of production and an absolute reduction of 22 from our baseline we have accomplished ghg reductions in our business primarily by displacing coal with natural gas and investing in new biomass boilers 

 

in 2021 we increased the ambition of our ghg emissionsreduction efforts by setting a sciencebased target  sbt  for ghg emissions reduction our sbt involves reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions 275 by 2030 from a 2019 baseline year the sbt also includes a reduction in absolute scope 3 ghg emissions from purchased goods and services fuel and energy activities upstream and downstream transportation and distribution and endoflife treatment of sold products by 275 within the same timeframe we validated the sbt with the sciencebased targets initiative and announced our target in the first half of 2022 

 

strategy 

 

we expect our sbt to guide our work as we plan invest in organize and develop projects to reduce our ghg emissions our current strategy to achieve our sbt includes projects to displace fossil fuels improve energy efficiency use virtual power purchase agreements and reevaluate our renewable energy credits  recs  strategy we expect to invest more than 160 million through 2030 to achieve our sbt although this estimate is subject to change for a variety of reasons including the timing of project completion we plan to regularly review our sbt strategy to consider the impacts of developing carbon reduction technologies optimize the mix of carbon reduction projects to achieve our targets and assess opportunities to achieve our sbt more quickly 

 

we also have embedded carbon considerations into our capital planning processes our capital request form includes a tool that provides project developers reviewers and approvers with information on whether their proposed initiative will add to or reduce carbon from the affected facility the tool also can be used to assess potential project impacts on water intake and solid waste generation this process is designed to increase awareness of ghg emissions and other environmental impacts within the organization and to provide us with information to use in optimizing our sbt and sustainability strategies 

 

opportunities and risks 

 

climate change presents certain opportunities and risks for our business 

 

with respect to opportunities for example we produce renewable energy and generate recs at our integrated kraft mills we have sold recs in the past and may sell them in the future the recs we generate are flexible marketbased tools that support the renewable energy market as part of our sbt strategy work we plan to consider whether modifying our use of recs may help us advance our progress against this target our recycling activities also may present the opportunity to generate offsets that could be used to meet climaterelated obligations for ourselves or others 

 

our business has been and may continue to be impacted by changing customer preferences for products perceived to be sustainable due to their carbon footprint we proactively engage in dialogue with customers that have expressed a desire to track or qualify their suppliers based on their carbon footprint we do not believe that our product offerings and operations have been materially impacted by climate change to date and we believe we are well positioned to meet customer requirements for fiberbased recyclable products that may replace plastic and minimize product endoflife ghg emissions 

 

climate change also presents risks and uncertainties for us with respect to physical risks our physical assets and infrastructure including our manufacturing operations have been and may in future periods be impacted by severe weatherrelated events such as hurricanes tornados other extreme storms wildfires and floods potentially resulting in items such as physical damage to our facilities and lost production unpredictable weather patterns also may result in supply chain disruptions and increased material costs such as through impacts to virgin fiber supplies and prices which may fluctuate during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during tree disease or insect 

 

epidemics that may be caused by variations in climate conditions on the other hand changes in climate also could result in more accommodating weather patterns for greater periods of time in certain areas which may create favorable fiber market conditions we incorporate a review of meteorological forecast data into our fiber procurement decisions and strategies to the extent that severe weatherrelated risks materialize and we are unprepared for them we may incur unexpected costs which could have a material effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock as hereinafter defined may be adversely impacted 

 

responses to climate change may result in regulatory risks as new laws and regulations aimed at reducing ghg emissions come into effect these rules and regulations could take the form of capandtrade carbon taxes or ghg reduction mandates for utilities that could increase the cost of purchased electricity new climate rules and regulations also may result in higher fossil fuel prices or fuel efficiency standards that could increase transportation costs certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have already taken actions to address climate change in the us the epa has issued the clean air act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit ghg the epa also has promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to file an annual report of their emissions while we have us facilities subject to existing ghg permitting and reporting requirements the impact of these requirements has not been material to date in addition to these national efforts some us states in which we have manufacturing operations including washington new york and virginia are taking measures to reduce ghg emissions such as requiring ghg emissions reporting or developing regional capandtrade programs 

 

several of our international facilities are in countries that have already adopted ghg emissions trading or other regulatory programs other countries in which we conduct business including china european union member states and india have set ghg reduction targets in accordance with the agreement among over 170 countries that established a framework for reducing global ghg emissions also known as the “ paris agreement ” which became effective in november 2016 and which the united states formally rejoined in february 2021 

 

we have systems in place for tracking the ghg emissions from our energyintensive facilities and we monitor developments in climate related laws regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and disclosure obligations compliance with climate programs may require future expenditures to meet ghg emission reduction obligations these obligations may include carbon taxes the requirement to purchase ghg credits or the need to acquire carbon offsets also we may be required to make capital and other investments to displace traditional fossil fuels such as fuel oil and coal with lower carbon alternatives such as biomass and natural gas 

 

additional information regarding our ghg targets and strategy are available in our 2021 sustainability report which we prepared in accordance with the global reporting initiative gri standards core option our sustainability reports are available on our website at wwwwestrockcomsustainability the information contained in these sustainability reports is not incorporated by reference into this form 10k and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the sec

human capital 

overview 

 

westrock aims to recruit develop and retain diverse bestinclass talent to foster their and our success we seek to create an environment where people can do their best work – a place where they can be their authentic 

 

selves guided by our values we strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful rewarding and inclusive work environment that enables our global team members to create products and services that further our mission to be the best paper and packaging company 

at september 30 2022 we employed approximately 50500 people approximately 92 were in sales and operations including manufacturing distribution product and services support and approximately 8 were in general and administration including groups such as finance human resources information technology legal and supply chain approximately 78 were located in the us and canada and 22 were located in europe south america mexico and asia pacific of the approximately 50500 employees approximately 70 were hourly and 30 were salaried approximately 55 of our hourly employees in the us and canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements “ cbas ” which typically have four to sixyear terms approximately 32 of those employees covered under cbas are operating under agreements that expire within one year and approximately 27 of those employees are working under expired contracts 

while we have experienced isolated work stoppages from time to time we believe that working relationships with our employees are generally good we are presently engaged with a labor dispute and resulting work stoppage at our mahrt mill in cottonton al we have effectuated a contingency plan and the mill is continuing to operate and produce paper for our customers 

in december 2019 the united steelworkers union “ usw ” ratified a master agreement that applies to substantially all of our us facilities represented by the usw the agreement has a fouryear term and covers a number of specific items including wages medical coverage and certain other benefit programs substance abuse testing and safety individual facilities will continue to have local agreements for subjects not covered by the master agreement and those agreements will continue to have staggered terms the master agreement permits us to apply its terms to usw employees who work at facilities we acquire during the term of the agreement the master agreement covers approximately 62 of our us operating locations and approximately 8800 of our employees while the terms of our cbas vary we believe the material terms of the agreements are customary for the industry the type of facility the classification of the employees and the geographic location covered 

see item 1a “ risk factors — we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters ” 

 

culture 

westrock’s culture is grounded in our values 

▪ integrity – being honest and ethical doing the right thing

▪ accountability – being responsible for our work and to our team collectively contributing to the success of our company and our customers 

▪ excellence – striving to perform at the highest levels – for ourselves our customers investors and communities 

 

at the core of our employee listening systems is our biannual engagement survey which is augmented with employee pulse checks after hire and promotion and exit interviewssurveys these pulse checkssurveys enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our employee programs in 2022 77 of selected team members participated in the pulse survey and 86 of global team members participated in the 2021 engagement survey the 2022 pulse survey showed a slight decrease in engagement when compared to the 2021 full engagement survey the survey and pulse covered topics such as company strategy and direction leadership inclusion safety culture pay and benefits and learning and development we use external benchmarks including one specific to manufacturing companies as points of comparison and monitor how we perform against these benchmarks for many of the items we survey 

 

diversity inclusion equity and belonging 

 

our diversity inclusion equity and belonging objective is to be a company where each of us genuinely belongs is respected and valued and can do our best work 

 

 

at september 30 2022 22 of our global workforce was comprised of women and 35 of our us based workforce was comprised of people of color our board of directors includes four women representing 33 of directors and two people of color representing 17 of directors we have implemented a multiyear plan designed to increase our workforce diversity advance inclusion equity and belonging accelerate the development and career movement of diverse talent and ensure diverse succession plans such that we continue to create future opportunities for all of our team members 

 

in fiscal 2021 the annual shortterm incentive plan for our ceo and for the senior leadership team reporting to the ceo included an evaluation and measurement of progress in the metrics and programs that directly support diversity and inclusion such as 

 

▪ talent acquisition and retention metrics 

▪ learning and development programs for leaders and managers commercial and operations talent 

▪ representation progress within and across career streams 

 

we expanded the application of the evaluation and measurement of our diversity and inclusion progress in our fiscal 2022 shortterm incentive plan to include approximately 100 of our senior leaders 

 

in fiscal 2022 we also partnered with external experts and developed a learning experience focused on unconscious bias and provided tailored workshops to 62 of our hourly workforce and 81 of our salaried workforce this experience is one example of how we are seeking to expand awareness and build the skill set and mindset to create a truly inclusive environment 

 

in collaboration with organizations such as the executive leadership council calibr harvard program for women pathways and signature we are providing external development opportunities for our diverse talent to connect and develop team members within westrock we support highly engaged resource groups for early in career women racial and ethnic minorities military people with different abilities or who identify as lgbtqia where team members can go for support networking and communitybuilding

 item 1a ri sk factors 

we are subject to certain risks and events that have adversely affected andor may in the future adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock par value 001 per share “ common stock ” in evaluating our business and any investment in our securities you should consider the following risk factors and the other information presented in this report as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec the risks addressed below are not the only ones we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely impact our business 

industry risks 

we are subject to pricing cycles which could materially adversely affect our businesses 

our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue experiencing pricing cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by 

 

product prices for our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which may be unpredictable and volatile where supply exceeds demand prices for our products could decline and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected for example we believe that the trading price of our common stock has been adversely affected in part due to concerns about the impact of macroeconomic conditions on pricing and demand and announcements by certain of our competitors of planned additional capacity in the north american containerboard market as well as the subsequent implementation of certain of those plans and the impact it will have on future supply and demand dynamics and pricing 

certain published indices including those published by pulp and paper week “ ppw ” contribute to the setting of selling prices for some of our products ppw is a limited survey that may not accurately reflect changes in market conditions for our products changes in how the indices in ppw are determined or maintained or other indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the selling prices for these products 

our earnings are highly dependent on volumes 

because our operations generally have high fixed operating costs our earnings are highly dependent on volumes which tend to fluctuate due to general economic conditions supply and demand dynamics in the markets we serve and due to company and customer specific issues we are presently experiencing lower demand for certain products due to macroeconomic conditions and customer inventory rebalancing these fluctuations at times lead to significant variability in our sales results of operations cash flow and financial condition making it difficult to predict our financial results with any degree of certainty this variability in performance due to fluctuations in volumes may also cause the trading price of our common stock to be adversely affected 

the covid pandemic has affected our operational and financial performance to varying degrees the extent of the effects of future public health crises including a resurgence of covid or related containment measures and government responses which result in reduced volumes are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted any failure to maintain volumes may materially adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation 

we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials energy sources and thirdparty companies to transport our goods 

 

the costs of recycled fiber and virgin fiber the principal externally sourced raw materials for our paper mills are subject to pricing variability due to market and industry conditions demand for recycled fiber has fluctuated and may increase due to among other factors increased consumption of recycled fiber including through additions of new recycled paper mill capacity increasing demand for products packaged in packaging made with paper manufactured from 100 recycled fiber and the shift by manufacturers of virgin paperboard tissue newsprint and corrugated packaging to the production of products with some recycled fiber content in fiscal 2022 we experienced periods of increased recycled fiber costs primarily due to market demand and availability before seeing prices decline in the fourth quarter 

 

the market price of virgin fiber varies based on availability and source of virgin fiber and the availability of virgin fiber may be impacted by among other factors wet weather conditions in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations fluctuate which impacts our manufacturing costs certain published indices contribute to price setting for some of our raw materials and future changes in how these indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the pricing of these raw materials 

 

the cost of natural gas which we use in many of our manufacturing operations including many of our mills and other energy costs including energy generated by burning natural gas fuel oil biomass and coal has at times fluctuated significantly in fiscal 2022 the price of the natural gas consumed in our manufacturing operations increased significantly compared to the prior year period energy costs have increased and in the future could continue to increase our operating costs and make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors 

 

 

we distribute our products primarily by truck and rail although we also distribute some of our products by cargo ship the reduced availability of trucks rail cars or cargo ships including as a result of labor shortages in the transportation industry could adversely impact our ability to distribute our products in a timely or costeffective manner we experienced higher freight costs and some distribution delays in both fiscal 2022 and 2021 high transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors 

 

because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the cost of raw materials energy or transportation through price increases for our products the failure to obtain raw materials energy or transportation services at reasonable market prices or the failure to pass on price increases to our customers or a reduction in the availability of raw materials energy or transportation services due to increased demand significant changes in climate or weather conditions or other factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we face intense competition 

we compete in industries that are highly competitive our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies we generally compete with companies operating in north america although we have operations spanning north america south america europe asia and australia factors affecting our ability to compete include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors’ pricing strategies the introduction by our competitors of new products technologies and equipment our ability to innovate and to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our ability to maintain the costefficiency of our operations including our facilities in addition changes within these industries including the consolidation of our competitors and customers may impact competitive dynamics if our competitors are more successful than us with respect to any key competitive factor our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

 

our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal customer shifts away from containerboard and paperboard packaging to packaging made from other materials could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

operating risks 

we may be unsuccessful in making and integrating mergers acquisitions and investments and completing divestitures 

we have completed a number of mergers acquisitions investments and divestitures in the past and we may acquire invest in or sell or enter into transactions with additional companies such as our planned acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in grupo gondi and the pending divestiture of our interior partition operations and three uncoated recycled paperboard mills we may not be able to identify suitable targets or purchasers or successfully complete suitable transactions in the future and completed transactions may not be successful these transactions create risks including but not limited to risks associated with 

  

 

 these transactions may not be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers that place higher strategic value on these businesses and assets than we do for acquisitions our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of realizing them depend on the successful integration of the acquired businesses and operations with our business and operations even if we integrate these businesses and operations successfully we may not realize the full benefits we expected within the anticipated timeframe or at all and the benefits may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays 

we may incur business disruptions that adversely affect our businesses 

our businesses depend on continuous operation of our facilities to be efficient the operations at our facilities have in the past and may in the future be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks including but not limited to risks associated with 

 for example operations at several of our facilities located in the south and southeastern us have been interrupted in recent years by hurricanes and severe winter weather resulting in among other things lost mill production in addition covid has impacted our operations and financial performance to varying degrees the extent of the effects of future public health crises including the impact of a resurgence of covid or other business disruptions on our operational and financial performance in future periods will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted during the covid pandemic we experienced and may experience in the future lower demand for certain of our products supply chain and labor disruptions and higher 

 

costs in addition our production capabilities may be disrupted if we are unable to secure sufficient supplies of raw materials or if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively as a result of a business disruption 

 

business disruptions have impaired and may in the future impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we may fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to offer differentiated solutions and we must continually develop and introduce new products and services to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments and changing customer preferences the services and products that we offer customers may not meet their needs as their business models evolve also our customers may decide to decrease their use of our products use alternative materials for their product packaging or forego the packaging of certain products entirely regulatory developments can also significantly alter the market for our products for example a move to electronic distribution of disclaimers and other paperless regimes could adversely impact our healthcare inserts and labels businesses similarly certain states and local governments have adopted laws banning singleuse paper bags or charging businesses or customers fees to use paper bags these and similar developments could adversely impact demand for certain of our products 

 

customer preferences for products and packaging formats are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience and health environmental and social concerns and perceptions for example changing consumer dietary habits and preferences have slowed the sales growth for certain of the food and beverage products that we package also there is an increasing focus among consumers to ensure that products delivered through ecommerce are packaged efficiently in addition customers are increasingly interested in the carbon footprint of our products for instance in 2019 amazon began requiring all items sold through amazon that are larger than a specified size to be designed and certified as readytoship our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences 

our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated 

we regularly make capital expenditures and many of our capital projects are complex costly andor implemented over an extended period of time our capital expenditures for particular capital projects could be higher than we anticipated we may experience unanticipated business disruptions or delays in completing the projects andor we may not achieve the desired benefits from the capital projects any of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in addition disputes between us and contractors who are involved with implementing capital projects could lead to timeconsuming and costly litigation 

we are exposed to risks related to international sales and operations 

we derived 183 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars we expect net sales from international operations to increase in fiscal 2023 in connection with our acquisition of grupo gondi in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected by risks related to the countries outside the us in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products countries are exposed to varying degrees of economic political and social instability in addition economies and operating environments have been and may continue to be adversely impacted to varying degrees by covid we are exposed to risks of operating in various countries including but not limited to risks associated with 

  

 

 we are also subject to taxation in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions and have several ongoing audit examinations covering multiple years with various tax authorities we base our tax returns on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations in effect however governing tax bodies have in the past and may in the future disagree with certain of our tax positions which could result in a higher tax liability for instance we are challenging claims by the brazil federal revenue department that we underpaid tax penalties and interest associated with a claim that a subsidiary of meadwestvaco corporation the predecessor of westrock mwv llc had reduced its tax liability related to the goodwill generated by the 2002 merger of two of its brazilian subsidiaries see item 8 – “ financial statements and supplemental data — note 17 commitments and contingencie s — brazil tax liability ” for additional information 

 

any one or more of these risks could adversely affect our international operations and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we cannot operate our joint ventures solely for our benefit which subjects us to risks 

we have invested in joint ventures and may form additional joint ventures in the future our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks including but not limited to risks associated with 

 we may produce faulty or contaminated products due to failures in quality control measures and systems 

our failure to produce products that meet safety and quality standards could result in adverse effects on consumer health litigation exposure loss of market share and adverse reputational and financial impacts among other potential consequences and we may incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action up to and including recalling products from end consumers and reimbursing customers andor end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of these failures our actions or omissions with respect to product safety and quality could lead to regulatory investigations enforcement actions andor prosecutions and result in adverse publicity which may damage our reputation any of these results could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

 

 

we provide representations in certain of our contracts that our products are produced in accordance with customer specifications if the product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated the manufacturer of the product may allege that the packaging we provided caused the fault or contamination even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications if our packaging fails to function properly or to preserve the integrity of its contents we could face liability from our customers and third parties for bodily injury or other damages these liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we are subject to cybersecurity risks including related to customer employee vendor or other company data 

we use information technologies to securely manage operations and various business functions we rely on various technologies some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information in addition we facilitate a variety of business processes and activities including reporting on our business and interacting with customers vendors and employees we also collect and store data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls our systems are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information manipulate data or disrupt our operations despite our security design and controls and those of our thirdparty providers we have in the past experienced and may in the future become subject to system damage disruptions or shutdowns these incidents may be due to any number of causes including cyberattacks data breaches employee error or malfeasance such as ransomware and data theft by common hackers criminal groups or nationstate organizations or social activist organizations which efforts may increase as a result of geopolitical events and political unrest around the world power outages telecommunication or utility failures systems failures service provider failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events misuse of internal applications theft of intellectual property trade secrets or other corporate assets and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information could result from such incidents 

 

in january 2021 we detected a ransomware attack impacting certain of our systems the “ ransomware incident ” in response we proactively shutdown a number of our systems which impacted certain of our operations including our ability to produce and ship paper and packaging due to these actions our mill system production was approximately 115000 tons lower than planned for the quarter ended march 31 2021 and we estimated the pretax income impact of the lost sales and operational disruption of this incident as well as ransomware recovery costs at approximately 80 million in response to the ransomware incident we accelerated information technology investments that we had previously planned to make in future periods in order to further strengthen our information security and technology infrastructure as a result we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs as we enhance our data security and take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to or manipulation of our systems and data despite these efforts similar incidents may occur in the future in particular the ransomware incident may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems additionally while we have insurance coverage in place to address various cyber risks this insurance coverage is subject to a deductible and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or types of claims that may arise in connection with such incidents 

 

the cybersecurityrelated vulnerabilities that we face may also remain undetected for an extended period of time we may face other challenges and risks during our integration of acquired businesses and operations as we upgrade and standardize our information technology systems we maintain contingency plans and processes to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events however these events could result in operational disruptions like those we suffered in connection with the ransomware incident or the misappropriation of sensitive data and depending on their nature and scope could lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and exposure to liability such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions including reputational damage and legal claims or proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters 

a significant number of our union employees are governed by cbas expired contracts are in the process of renegotiation and others expire within one year we may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts without work stoppages or labor difficulties or renegotiate them on favorable terms we have experienced isolated 

 

work stoppages from time to time we are presently engaged with a labor dispute and resulting work stoppage at our mahrt mill in cottonton al we have effectuated a contingency plan and the mill is continuing to operate and produce paper for our customers if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages or if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected in addition our businesses rely on vendors suppliers and other third parties that have union employees strikes or work stoppages affecting these vendors suppliers and other third parties could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we operate in a challenging market for talent and may not attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel including key personnel 

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate train and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers the increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as more tenured and experienced workers retire if we are unable to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel or if we experience excessive turnover particularly among hourly workers we may experience declining sales manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies increased recruiting training and relocation costs and other difficulties and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted 

the market for both hourly workers and professional workers remained challenging in fiscal 2022 the market and labor environment for hourly workers is increasingly competitive and experiencing higher levels of labor unrest in certain locations where we operate the demand for labor continues to exceed the supply of labor resulting in higher costs for employers despite our focused efforts to attract and retain employees including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances and retention bonuses in select locations we experienced attrition rates within our hourly workforce in fiscal 2022 that exceeded pre2021 levels and we incurred higher operating costs at certain of our facilities in the form of higher levels of overtime pay due to shift requirements and staffing challenges 

the market for professional workers remains challenging many professional workers desire a fully remote work setting we offer flexible working arrangements in the majority of instances however we may experience higher levels of attrition within our professional workforce if employees do not perceive the purpose and impact of their work to be rewarding or worklife balance to be satisfactory 

we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively the loss of these employees combined with a challenging market for attracting and retaining employees could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted 

we face physical operational financial and reputational risks associated with climate change 

our physical assets and infrastructure including our manufacturing operations have been and remain subject to risks from volatile and damaging weather patterns for example severe weatherrelated events such as hurricanes tornados other extreme storms wildfires and floods have resulted in and could in future periods result in lost production andor physical damage to our facilities unpredictable weather patterns also may result in supply chain disruptions and increased material costs the ability to harvest the virgin fiber used in our manufacturing operations may be limited and prices for this raw material may fluctuate during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during tree disease or insect epidemics that may be caused by variations in climate conditions such events could also impact the premiums we pay for insurance other climaterelated business risks that we face include risks related to the transition to a lowercarbon economy such as increased prices for certain fuels including natural gas the introduction of a carbon tax or government mandates to reduce ghg emissions and more stringent andor complex environmental and other permitting requirements to the extent that severe weatherrelated risks materialize and we are unprepared for them we may incur unexpected costs which could have a material effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted 

 

 

there has been an increased focus including from investors customers the general public and us and foreign governmental and nongovernmental authorities on climate change and ghg emissions we have voluntarily established targets to reduce ghg emissions by 2030 for example we have established a sbt to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions 275 by 2030 from a 2019 baseline year the sbt also includes a targeted reduction in absolute scope 3 ghg emissions from purchased goods and services fuel and energy activities upstream and downstream transportation and distribution and endoflife treatment of sold products by 275 within the same timeframe meeting our sbt is expected to increase our capital expenditures and may increase our operational costs the anticipated capital and operational costs to achieve our sbt could deviate materially from our initial estimates further the achievement of our sbt is subject to various risks and uncertainties some of which are outside our control 

 

we have also established and publicly disclosed other esg targets and goals and other sustainability commitments that are subject to a variety of assumptions risks and uncertainties if we are unable to meet these targets goals or commitments on our projected timelines or at all or if they are not perceived to be sufficiently robust our reputation as well as our relationships with investors customers and other stakeholders could be harmed which could in turn adversely impact our business and results of operations in addition not all of our competitors may seek to establish climate or other esg targets and goals or at a comparable level to ours which could result in our competitors achieving competitive advantages through lower supply chain or operating costs 

we may not be able to successfully implement our strategic transformation initiatives including our new business systems transformation 

we have undertaken several projects to enhance productivity and increase efficiency throughout our businesses which may not be achieved on the anticipated timelines or at all in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we launched a multiyear phased business systems transformation project the investment will replace much of our existing disparate systems and transition them to a standardized enterprise resource planning “ erp ” system on a cloudbased platform as well as a suite of other complementing technologies across our global organization the new systems are intended to transform areas such as manufacturing supply chain procurement quote to cash financials and analytics and position us to better leverage automation and process efficiency and enable productivity enhancements an implementation of this scale is a major financial undertaking and will require substantial time and attention of management and key employees we may not be able to successfully implement our erp system without delays related to resource constraints or challenges with the critical design phases of the implementation or we may experience unanticipated business disruptions andor we may not achieve the desired benefits from the project project completion dates and anticipated costs may also change additionally the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected if the new erp is not successfully implemented any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

financial risks 

we have been and may be in the future adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change 

our businesses have been and may be adversely affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control including but not limited to 

  

 

 for instance we are presently experiencing lower demand for certain products due to macroeconomic conditions and customer inventory rebalancing this circumstance may be exacerbated if these conditions lead to higher unemployment rates lower family income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment andor lower consumer spending the global economy is also experiencing the highest levels of inflation in decades and we are experiencing cost inflation across our business persistent inflation results in continued higher production and transportation costs which we may not be able to recover through higher prices charged to our customers these conditions and other macroeconomic uncertainties could result in higher operating and distribution costs driven by economic downtime as we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 

 

in addition changes in trade policy including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs could impact demand for our products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments macroeconomic challenges may also lead to changes in tax laws or tax rates that may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities for example the biden administration has proposed significant changes to the us tax laws including an increase to the federal corporate tax rate limiting deductions where certain conditions exist and several proposals that would have the combined effect of increasing the us taxation on profits earned outside the us on august 16 2022 the inflation reduction act of 2022  inflation reduction act  was signed into law with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15 minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1 excise tax on share repurchases while we are still evaluating the impact that the inflation reduction act will have on our financial results we do not believe the impact will be material 

 

we are not able to predict or control adverse changes in economic and financial market conditions and adverse social and political change and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected by these matters 

 

we depend on certain large customers 

we have large customers none of which individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 the loss of large customers could adversely affect our sales and depending on the magnitude of the loss our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in particular because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly bid for new business or for the renewal of existing business the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may adversely impact our financial results 

we have had significant levels of indebtedness in the past and may incur significant levels of indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business 

at september 30 2022 we had 78 billion of debt outstanding compared to 82 billion at september 30 2021 we expect to incur additional debt in connection with the acquisition of the remaining interest in grupo gondi the level of our indebtedness has important consequences including 

  

 

  

our credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants including a covenant to satisfy a debt to capitalization ratio these restrictions may limit our flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures 

credit rating downgrades could increase our borrowing costs or otherwise adversely affect us 

some of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from rating agencies our credit ratings could change based on among other things our results of operations and financial condition credit ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a “watch list” for a possible downgrade or assigned a “negative outlook” actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could increase our borrowing costs which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock if a downgrade were to occur or a negative outlook were to be assigned it could impact our ability to access the capital markets to raise debt andor increase the associated costs in addition while our credit ratings are important to us we may take actions and otherwise operate our business in a manner that adversely affects our credit ratings 

we sell shortterm receivables from certain customer trade accounts on a revolving basis any downgrade of the credit rating or deterioration of the financial condition of these customers may make it more costly or difficult for us to engage in these activities which could adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a writedown could materially adversely impact our operating results and stockholders’ equity 

at september 30 2022 the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was 88 billion we review the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when impairment indicators exist the impairment test requires us to analyze a number of factors and make estimates that require judgment in fiscal 2022 each of our reporting units had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by more than 15 future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows changes in our business strategy and external market conditions among other factors could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net income if a significant write down were required the charge could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and stockholders’ equity and could impact the trading price of our common stock in fiscal 2020 we recorded a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of approximately 13 billion in our legacy consumer packaging reporting unit 

we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring 

we have previously restructured portions of our operations and likely will engage in future restructuring initiatives for instance during fiscal 2022 we recorded various impairments and other charges associated with our decision to permanently cease operations at our panama city fl mill and to permanently close the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our st paul mn mill because we are not able to predict or control market conditions including changes in the supply and demand for our products the loss of large customers the selling prices for our products or our manufacturing costs we may not be able to predict the appropriate time to undertake restructurings the cash and noncash costs associated with these activities vary depending on the type of facility impacted with the noncash cost of a mill closure generally being more significant than that of a converting facility due to the higher level of investment restructuring activities may divert the attention of management disrupt our operations and fail to achieve the intended cost and operations benefits in addition significant judgment is required to estimate restructuring costs and these estimates and the assumptions underlying them may change as additional information becomes available or facts or circumstances related to the restructuring initiative change 

we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with multiemployer pension plans 

we participate in several multiemployer pension plans “ mepp ” or “ mepps ” our contributions to any particular mepp may increase based on the declining funded status of a mepp and legal requirements such as 

 

those of the pension protection act of 2006 “ pension act ” which require substantially underfunded mepps to implement a funding improvement plan “ fip ” or a rehabilitation plan “ rp ” to improve their funded status the funded status of a mepp may be impacted by among other items a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans the inability or failure of companies withdrawing from the plan to pay their withdrawal liability low interest rates changes in actuarial assumptions andor lower than expected returns on pension fund assets 

 

we believe that certain of the mepps in which we participate or have participated including the pace industry unionmanagement pension fund “ piumpf ” have material unfunded vested benefits we submitted formal notification to withdraw from mepps in the past and have recorded withdrawal liabilities including an estimate of our portion of piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency we may withdraw from other mepps in the future at september 30 2022 we had 2147 million of withdrawal liabilities including liabilities associated with piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency demands in july 2021 piumpf filed suit against us in the us district court for the northern district of georgia claiming the right to recover our pro rata share of the pension fund’s accumulated funding deficiency along with interest liquidated damages and attorney’s fees the impact of increased contributions future funding obligations or future withdrawal liabilities may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” and “ note 17 commitments and contingencies — litigation ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign laws regulations and other requirements including those relating to the environment product safety competition corruption occupational health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax and health care these laws regulations and other requirements may change or be applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our equipment andor operations subject us to enforcement risk expose us to reputational harm or impose on or require us to incur additional costs including substantial compliance costs which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations our environmental expenditures include those related to compliance with air and water permits and regulatory requirements waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater including situations where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party “ prp ” because environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving we will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance and our compliance costs could increase materially future compliance with existing and new laws and requirements has the potential to disrupt our business operations and may require significant expenditures and our existing reserves for specific matters may not be adequate to cover future costs in particular our manufacturing operations consume significant amounts of energy and we may in the future incur additional or increased capital operating and other expenditures from changes due to new or increased climaterelated and other environmental requirements we could also incur substantial liabilities including fines or sanctions enforcement actions natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury under environmental and common laws 

 

the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 and local antibribery laws including those in brazil china mexico india and the united kingdom where we maintain operations directly or through a joint venture prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of influencing official decisions our internal control policies and procedures or those of our vendors may not adequately protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed or alleged to have been committed by our employees agents or vendors any such violations could lead to civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties andor could damage our reputation 

 

we are subject to a number of labor and employment and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility additionally changing privacy laws in the united states where among others the california consumer privacy act became effective in 

 

2020 and its successor the california privacy rights act which will be effective january 1 2023 europe where the general data protection regulation became effective in 2018 brazil where the lei geral de proteção de dados became effective in 2020 china where the personal information protection law became effective on november 1 2021 and elsewhere have created new individual privacy rights imposed increased obligations on companies handling personal data and increased potential exposure to fines and penalties 

 

our bylaws contain an exclusive forum provision that could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose their preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees

this provision of the bylaws may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers and other employees alternatively if a court were to find this provision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in any action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the action may result in outcomes unfavorable to us which could have a materially adverse impact on our reputation our business operations and our financial position or results of operations

presentation 

 

effective october 1 2021 we reorganized our segment reporting to four reportable segments corrugated packaging consumer packaging global paper and distribution we reorganized our reportable segments due to changes in our organizational structure and how our codm makes key operating decisions allocates resources and assesses the performance of our business effective october 1 2021 adjusted ebitda as hereinafter defined is our measure of segment profitability in accordance with asc 280 “ segment reporting ” because it is used by our codm to make decisions regarding allocation of resources and to assess segment performance prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the new segment structure these changes did not impact our consolidated financial statements see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

during fiscal 2020 we completed the monetization of the various real estate holdings that we owned that were concentrated in the charleston sc region following completion of the monetization of these assets we ceased reporting the results of the land and development segment as a separate segment 

 

certain items are not allocated to our operating segments and thus the information that our codm uses to make operating decisions and assess performance does not reflect such amounts adjusted ebitda is defined as pretax earnings of a reportable segment before depreciation depletion and amortization and excludes the following items our codm does not consider part of our segment performance gain on sale of certain closed facilities multiemployer pension withdrawal expense income mineral rights impairment restructuring and other costs goodwill impairment nonallocated expenses interest expense net loss on extinguishment of debt other expense income net and other adjustments  adjusted ebitda  — each as outlined in “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2022 yearoveryear changes can be found below as well as a detailed discussion of fiscal 2021 yearoveryear changes due to the segment reorganization noted above 

strategic acquisitions and other portfolio actions 

we are committed to improving our return on invested capital as well as maximizing the performance of our assets from time to time we have completed acquisitions that have expanded our product and geographic scope allowed us to increase our integration levels and impacted our comparative financials we expect to continue to evaluate potential acquisitions in the future although the size of individual acquisitions may vary there were no significant acquisitions in the last three years see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may be unsuccessful in making and integrating mergers acquisitions and investments and completing divestitures ” 

on july 27 2022 we announced our entry into an agreement to acquire the remaining 677 interest in grupo gondi see “ note 3 acquisitions and investments ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the announcement 

in fiscal 2022 we completed the following portfolio actions i we permanently ceased operations at our panama city fl mill and ii we permanently closed the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at our st paul mn mill both operations were expected to require significant capital investment to maintain and improve going forward and the production of fluff pulp at panama city was not a priority in our strategy to focus on higher value markets closing these operations allows us to redirect significant capital that would have been required to keep them competitive in the future to improve other key assets in connection with these actions we recorded various impairments and other charges and we expect to record future restructuring charges primarily associated 

 

with future carrying costs see “ note 4 restructuring and other costs ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

in november 2022 we announced the planned sale of our interior partitions converting operations and three uncoated recycled paperboard mills chattanooga tn eaton in and aurora il in two transactions for a combined 380 million subject to working capital adjustments these divestitures align with our commitment to optimize our portfolio and focus our strategy on key end markets see “ note 22 subsequent events ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

business systems transformation 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we launched a multiyear phased business systems transformation project the investment will replace much of our existing disparate systems and transition them to a standardized erp system on a cloudbased platform as well as a suite of other complementing technologies across approximately 90 of our footprint based on net sales 

the new systems are intended to transform areas such as manufacturing supply chain procurement quote to cash financials and analytics and position us to better leverage automation and process efficiency and enable productivity enhancements an implementation of this scale is a major financial undertaking and will require substantial time and attention of management and key employees project completion dates and anticipated costs may also change as the systems are phased in they will become a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may not be able to successfully implement our strategic transformation initiatives including our new business systems transformation ” 

due to the nature scope and magnitude of this investment management believes these incremental transformation costs are above the normal recurring level of spending for information technology to support operations these strategic investments are not expected to recur in the foreseeable future and are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance as such management believes presenting these costs as an adjustment in the nongaap results provides additional information to investors about trends in our operations and is useful for periodoverperiod comparisons this presentation also allows investors to view our underlying operating results in the same manner as they are viewed by management 

the expenses expected to be adjusted from net income loss attributable to common stockholders  net income  are expensed as incurred during the implementation of software applications and other enabling technologies and do not include deferred or capitalized costs depreciation andor amortization and costs to support or maintain these software applications or systems once they are in productive use during the investment period the normal level of spend associated with nontransformative programs is expected to be maintained and these expenses will not be adjusted in our nongaap measures the items adjusted from net income will also be adjusted in our presentation of consolidated adjusted ebitda 

executive summary 

 

net sales of 212565 million for fiscal 2022 increased 25104 million or 134 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher selling pricemix that was partially offset by lower volumes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we experienced lost sales associated with the ransomware incident and winter weather events the “ events ” and we estimate these events decreased net sales by approximately 1891 million 

 

net income attributable to common stockholders of 9446 million in fiscal 2022 increased 127 compared to fiscal 2021 the impact of higher selling pricemix and ransomware recoveries was largely offset by increased cost inflation higher operating costs and lower volumes consolidated adjusted ebitda of 34594 million in fiscal 2022 increased 4602 million or 153 a detailed review of our performance appears below under “ results of operations ” 

earnings per diluted share was 361 in fiscal 2022 compared to 313 in fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per diluted share were 476 and 339 in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively see the discussion and tables under  nongaap financial measures  below with respect to consolidated adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per diluted share 

 

 

we generated 20204 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 compared to 22799 million in fiscal 2021 the decline was primarily due to 5113 million of greater working capital usage compared to the prior year period that was partially offset by higher earnings excluding noncash impairments primarily associated with restructuring activities the greater working capital usage in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to actions taken in the prior year to preserve cash due to uncertainty during the covid pandemic such as the payment of certain bonuses and 401k match in stock in fiscal 2021 that were paid in cash in fiscal 2022 and the payment in fiscal 2022 of certain previously deferred payroll taxes that relate to relief offered under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act “ cares act ” from prior years see “ westrock pandemic action plan ” for more information we invested 8626 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 while returning 2595 million in dividends to our stockholders and repurchasing 6000 million of common stock we believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest to sustain and improve our operating performance see “ liquidity and capital resources ” for more information 

a detailed review of our fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 performance appears below under “ results of operations ” 

 

expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2023 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 we expect a sequential decline in net sales and earnings from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 reflecting the normal seasonal sequential volume declines in many of our businesses and scheduled mill maintenance outages resulting in approximately 150000 tons of maintenance downtime along with customer inventory rebalancing and macroeconomic uncertainty we expect lower volume with four fewer shipping days during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and one fewer shipping day than in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we expect unfavorable noncash pension expense of approximately 40 million driven by higher interest rates and market volatility and sequential natural gas and recycled fiber deflation down approximately 20 and 70 respectively we also expect increased health insurance costs prior to the annual reset of employee deductibles we further expect the continued flow through of previously published price increases and to continue balancing our supply with our customers’ demand we plan to draw upon our 10 billion delayed draw term loan to acquire the remaining 677 interest in grupo gondi and our results will include the corresponding increased interest expense  

 

in fiscal 2023 we expect our results to be significantly impacted by planned portfolio actions noncash pension expense and currency headwinds we also expect our results to be negatively impacted by customer inventory rebalancing primarily in our first fiscal quarter and macroeconomic uncertainty as well as scheduled mill maintenance outages we further expect the continued flow through of previously published price increases and to continue balancing our supply with our customers demand we expect the planned portfolio actions grupo gondi and announced divestitures to add an estimated net 85 million of adjusted ebitda we expect unfavorable noncash pension expense of approximately 160 million driven by higher interest rates and market volatility and an estimated 50 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates we expect approximately 465000 tons of maintenance downtime compared to approximately 409000 tons in fiscal 2022 we are also targeting over 250 million in net cost savings in fiscal 2023 related to execution on our transformation initiatives including items such as increased mill and converting network efficiencies indirect spend savings and selling general and administrative  sga  expense reductions for additional information on our planned portfolio actions see “ note 3 acquisitions and investments ” and “ note 22 subsequent events ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our business systems transformation see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — business systems transformation ” 

 

westrock pandemic action plan 

 

in may 2020 given the uncertainties associated with the severity and duration of the pandemic we announced and began implementing the westrock pandemic action plan we focused and continue to focus on the protection safety and wellbeing of our team members and continuing to match our supply with our customers’ demand we modified the westrock pandemic action plan as the impact of covid evolved the actions that we took pursuant to the plan targeted approximately 1 billion in additional cash through the end of calendar 2021 which was available for use to reduce our outstanding indebtedness in fiscal 2020 we achieved more than 350 million of the approximately 1 billion goal set forth in the westrock pandemic action plan as modified as of september 30 2021 we had achieved more than 975 million of the approximately 1 billion goal and discontinued measurement 

 

 

we committed to i reducing discretionary expenses ii using common stock to make company funded 401k match and annual contribution ie up to 5 and 25 respectively from july 1 2020 through september 30 2021 final period funded in october 2021 iii targeting a reduction of fiscal 2021 capital investments to a range of 800 million to 900 million up from an initial range of 600 to 800 million we invested 8155 million in fiscal 2021 and iv resetting our quarterly dividend to 020 per share for an annual rate of 080 per share which we did in may 2020 see “ liquidity and capital resources — cash flow activity ” for information regarding subsequent increases to our dividend 

 

in addition to the items addressed above we i decreased the salaries of our senior executive team by up to 25 from may 1 2020 through december 31 2020 and decreased the retainer for members of our board of directors by 25 for the third and fourth calendar quarters of 2020 ii used common stock to pay our annual incentive for fiscal 2020 for nearly all participants and set the payout level at 50 of the target opportunity subject to a safety modifier as well as for company funded 401k match and our annual contribution as noted above and iii postponed 1165 million of employment taxes incurred through the end of calendar year 2020 pursuant to relief offered under the cares act we also reduced fiscal 2020 capital investments to 9781 million after targeting to reduce them by approximately 150 million to approximately 950 million we paid the first 50 of employment taxes deferred under the cares act as required in december 2021 and expect to pay the remaining 50 by december 2022 

 

we began tracking the impact of costs associated with safety cleaning and other items related to covid in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and discontinued doing so during fiscal 2022 due to their continuing nature at relatively consistent levels we expect to continue to incur expenses for these items as needed in the future during fiscal 2021 we recorded 384 million of expense related to covid including 220 million of relief payments to employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 the balance was for increased costs for safety cleaning and other items related to covid during fiscal 2020 we provided onetime covid recognition awards to our team members who work in manufacturing and operations and recognized expense of 316 million for those awards during fiscal 2020 we also incurred an additional expense of 324 million for cleaning safety supplies and equipment screening resources and other items we did not have any relief payments paid to employees in fiscal 2022 

 

ransomware incident 

as previously disclosed on january 23 2021 we detected a ransomware incident impacting certain of our systems promptly upon our detection of this incident we initiated response and containment protocols and our security teams supplemented by leading cyber defense firms worked to remediate this incident we undertook extensive efforts to identify contain and recover from this incident quickly and securely our teams worked to maintain our business operations and minimize the impact on our customers and team members in our form 10q for the second quarter fiscal 2021 we announced that all systems were back in service all of our mills and converting locations began producing and shipping paper and packaging at preransomware levels in march 2021 or earlier for more information on the ransomware incident including the financial impact see “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — ransomware incident ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see item 1a “ risk factors — we are subject to cybersecurity risks including related to customer employee vendor or other company data ” 

 

 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes our consolidated results for the three years ended september 30 2022 in millions 

 

 net sales unaffiliated customers 

net sales in fiscal 2022 increased 25104 million or 134 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to the impact of higher selling pricemix that was partially offset by lower volumes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency in fiscal 2021 we lost an estimated 1891 million of net sales associated with the events all in the second quarter 

net sales in fiscal 2021 increased 11673 million or 66 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher selling pricemix and higher volumes partially offset by lost sales associated with the events additionally we experienced a net favorable impact of foreign currency across our segments volumes in fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by covid primarily in the last half of the fiscal year 

see “ segment information ” below for the change in net sales before intersegment eliminations by segment 

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold increased to 172358 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 153158 million in fiscal 2021 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 811 in fiscal 2022 compared to 817 in fiscal 2021 the decrease was primarily due to higher selling prices and ransomware recoveries in fiscal 2022 which were largely offset by increased cost inflation higher operating costs and increased planned downtime including maintenance outages fiscal 2021 included the negative impact of the events versus insurance recoveries in fiscal 2022 in fiscal 2022 we received 506 million of business interruption recoveries recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold see “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — ransomware incident ” for additional information cost inflation consisted primarily of higher energy wage and benefit costs recycled fiber freight virgin fiber and chemical costs in fiscal 2021 we recorded 197 million of onetime recognition awards to our team members who work in manufacturing and operations while costs increased in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 driven by the factors noted above we sought to mitigate their impact our mitigation strategies such as through price increases and productivity and other cost control efforts provided us some 

 

flexibility to respond to these circumstances but we may be unsuccessful in doing so in future periods in fiscal 2022 we entered into various natural gas commodity derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are scheduled to be settled over the next twelve months these positions were entered into to help us mitigate commodity pricing risk see “ note 18 accumulated other comprehensive loss and other comprehensive income loss ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our natural gas commodity derivatives 

cost of goods sold increased to 153158 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 143816 million in fiscal 2020 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 817 in fiscal 2021 compared to 818 in fiscal 2020 the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher volumes increased cost inflation and other items including operational disruption associated with the events these items were partially offset by productivity improvements and other items in fiscal 2020 we incurred approximately 45 million of direct costs and property damage associated with hurricane michael and received hurricane michaelrelated insurance proceeds of 323 million and recorded a reduction of cost of goods sold of 321 million in connection with an indirect tax claim in brazil the hurricane michaelrelated insurance proceeds were for 206 million of direct costs and property damage and for 117 million for business interruption recoveries in fiscal 2021 we recorded costs of goods sold of 354 million related to covid primarily for relief payments to employees and increased costs for safety cleaning and other items related to covid fiscal 2020 includes costs of goods sold of 565 million associated with covid including onetime recognition awards to our team members who work in manufacturing and operations increased costs for safety cleaning and other items related to covid we began to track and report the impact of covid on fiscal 2020 in the third fiscal quarter cost inflation consisted primarily of higher recycled fiber wage and benefit costs energy freight chemical and virgin fiber costs 

selling general and administrative excluding intangible amortization 

sga excluding intangible amortization increased 1733 million to 19326 million in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 sga excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of net sales decreased in fiscal 2022 to 91 from 94 in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher selling prices the sga increase in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to 763 million of increased compensation and benefits in addition we incurred 227 million of increased travel and entertainment costs 191 million of increased softwarecomputer expenses 140 million of increased bad debt expense and 106 million of higher consulting professional and legal fees the increased travel and entertainment costs are still well below prepandemic levels in fiscal 2022 we recorded 66 million of ransomware recoveries of direct costs compared to expense net of initial recoveries of approximately 19 million in fiscal 2021 

sga excluding intangible amortization increased 1349 million to 17593 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 1198 million increase in bonus and stockbased compensation expense including a 96 million acceleration of stockbased compensation in connection with the departure of our former ceo in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 in addition we incurred increased aggregate costs for consulting professional and legal fees of 212 million compared to the prior year period primarily associated with the ransomware incident these increases were partially offset by a 294 million decrease in bad debt expense compared to the prior year period as well as a 184 million reduction in travel and entertainment associated with prolonged shelterinplace orders in response to the ongoing effects of covid sga excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal 2021 to 94 from 92 in fiscal 2020 

selling general and administrative intangible amortization 

sga intangible amortization was 3504 million 3571 million and 4005 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the expense primarily represents the amortization of customer relationship intangibles acquired in business combinations the decline in fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to certain intangibles from prior acquisitions reaching full amortization 

mineral rights impairment 

in fiscal 2022 we recorded a 260 million pretax noncash impairment of certain mineral rights as a result of the lack of new leasing or development activity on the related properties for an extended period of time with the impairment in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 we have no remaining mineral rights 

 

restructuring and other costs 

we recorded pretax restructuring and other costs of 4016 million 315 million and 1127 million for fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively these amounts are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with each restructuring acquisition integration or divestiture vary the increase in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by the closure of our panama city fl mill and the permanent closure of the corrugated medium manufacturing operations at the st paul mn mill 

we generally expect the integration of a closed facility’s production with other facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility see “ note 4 restructuring and other costs ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including a description of the type of costs incurred we have restructured portions of our operations from time to time and it is likely that we will engage in additional restructuring initiatives in the future see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring ” 

goodwill impairment 

no goodwill impairments were recorded in fiscal 2022 or 2021 in fiscal 2020 we recorded a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of 13332 million in our legacy consumer packaging reportable segment the impairment was primarily the result of expected lower volumes and cash flows related to certain external bleached paperboard end markets including commercial print tobacco and plate and cup stock markets see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — critical accounting policies and estimates — goodwill” for more information on our goodwill impairment testing 

interest expense net 

interest expense net was 3188 million and 3723 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively the decrease was primarily due to a net 358 million reduction in interest expense associated with the remeasurement of our multiemployer pension liabilities for the increase in interest rates in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 in addition interest expense net declined due to lower debt levels compared to the prior year period these declines were partially offset by higher interest rates on debt in the fiscal year ended september 30 2022 

interest expense net was 3723 million and 3935 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease was primarily due to lower debt levels that was partially offset by higher interest rates in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 additionally fiscal 2020 was impacted by 205 million of interest income recorded in connection with an indirect tax claim in brazil partially offset by a 150 million increase in interest expense associated with the remeasurement of our multiemployer pension liabilities see “ note 17 commitments and contingencies — indirect tax claim ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see item 1a “ risk factors — we have had significant levels of indebtedness in the past and may incur significant levels of indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ” 

pension and other postretirement nonservice income 

pension and other postretirement nonservice income was 1574 million and 1349 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively the increase was primarily due to the increase in plan asset balances used to determine the expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2022 customary pension and other postretirement income costs are included in our segment results 

pension and other postretirement nonservice income was 1349 million and 1033 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase was primarily due to the increase in plan asset balances used to determine the expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2021 see “ note 5 retirement plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

other expense income net was expense of 110 million and income of 109 million and 95 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase in expense in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to a 93 million increase in fees associated with the sale of receivables and a 57 million less favorable impact of exchange rates compared to fiscal 2021 

fiscal 2021 primarily included a 165 million gain on sale of the summerville sc sawmill and a 160 million gain on sale of our rosenbloom legacy cost method investment which were partially offset by a 225 million charge associated with not exercising an option to purchase an additional equity interest in grupo gondi at that time 

equity in income of unconsolidated entities 

we recorded equity in income of unconsolidated entities of 729 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 409 million in fiscal 2021 the increase was driven by earnings improvement across the portfolio most notably in a displays joint venture and our joint venture with grupo gondi on july 27 2022 we announced our entry into an agreement to acquire the remaining 677 interest in grupo gondi see “ note 3 acquisitions and investments ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the announcement

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures mergers acquisitions and investments restructuring activities dividends and stock repurchases from net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from our accounts receivable sales agreements proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment removed from service and proceeds received in connection with the issuance of debt and equity securities see “ note 13 debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding our debt funding for our domestic operations in the foreseeable future is expected to come 

 

from sources of liquidity within our domestic operations including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facilities as such our foreign cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be a key source of liquidity to our domestic operations 

we are a party to enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties these obligations impact our shortterm and longterm liquidity and capital resource needs certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of september 30 2022 while others are considered future obligations our contractual obligations primarily consist of items such as longterm debt including current portion lease obligations purchase obligations and other obligations see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — contractual obligations”  for additional information 

cash and cash equivalents were 2602 million at september 30 2022 and 2909 million at september 30 2021 approximately twothirds of the cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2022 were held outside of the us the proportion of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us generally varies from period to period at september 30 2022 total debt was 77872 million 2122 million of which was current at september 30 2021 total debt was 81941 million 1688 million of which was current included in our total debt at september 30 2022 was 1751 million of noncash acquisition related stepup during fiscal 2022 debt decreased 4069 million due to repayments primarily using net cash provided by operating activities that exceeded aggregate capital expenditures and capital returned to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 

 

at september 30 2022 we had approximately 37 billion of availability under our longterm committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents excluding the 10 billion delayed draw term loan that we plan to use to acquire the remaining 677 interest in grupo gondi  our primary availability is under our revolving credit facilities and receivables securitization facility the majority of which matures on july 7 2027 this liquidity may be used to provide for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes including acquisitions dividends and stock repurchases on march 22 2022 we redeemed 350 million aggregate principal amount of our 400 senior notes due march 2023 primarily using borrowings under our receivables securitization facility and recorded an 82 million loss on extinguishment of debt on september 10 2021 we redeemed 400 million aggregate principal amount of our 4900 senior notes due march 2022 using cash and cash equivalents and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 86 million 

our credit facilities contain certain restrictive covenants including a covenant to satisfy a debt to capitalization ratio we test and report our compliance with all of these covenants as required by these facilities and were in compliance with them at september 30 2022 

at september 30 2022 we had 571 million of outstanding letters of credit not drawn upon 

 

we use a variety of working capital management strategies including supply chain financing  scf  programs vendor financing and commercial card programs monetization facilities where we sell shortterm receivables to a group of thirdparty financial institutions and receivables securitization facilities we describe these programs below 

we engage in certain customerbased scf programs to accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding accounts receivables from certain customers certain costs of these programs are borne by the customer or us receivables transferred under these customerbased scf programs generally meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with guidance under financial accounting standards board’s “ fasb ” accounting standards codification “ asc ” 860 “ transfers and servicing ” “ asc 860 ” resulting in derecognition of such receivables from our consolidated balance sheets receivables involved with these customerbased scf programs constitute approximately 2 of our annual net sales in addition we have monetization facilities that sell to thirdparty financial institutions all of the shortterm receivables generated from certain customer trade accounts see “ note 12 fair value — accounts receivable sales agreements ” for a discussion of our monetization facilities 

our working capital management strategy includes working with our suppliers to revisit terms and conditions including the extension of payment terms our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers generally range from payable upon receipt to 120 days and vary for items such as the availability of cash discounts we do not believe our payment terms will be shortened significantly in the near future and we do not expect our net cash provided by operating activities to be significantly impacted by additional extensions of payment terms certain 

 

financial institutions offer voluntary scf programs that enable our suppliers at their sole discretion to sell their receivables from us to the financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers we and our suppliers agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure including prices quantities and payment terms regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in scf programs the suppliers sell us goods or services and issue the associated invoices to us based on the agreedupon contractual terms the due dates of the invoices are not extended due to the supplier’s participation in scf programs our suppliers at their sole discretion if they choose to participate in a scf program determine which invoices if any they want to sell to the financial institutions no guarantees are provided by us under scf programs and we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the scf program therefore amounts due to our suppliers that elect to participate in scf programs are included in the line items accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and the activity is reflected in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on correspondence with the financial institutions that are involved with our two primary scf programs while the amount suppliers elect to sell to the financial institutions varies from period to period the amount generally averages approximately 17 to 19 of our accounts payable balance on our consolidated balance sheets 

we also participate in certain vendor financing and commercial card programs to support our travel and entertainment expenses and smaller vendor purchases amounts outstanding under these programs are classified as debt primarily because we receive the benefit of extended payment terms and a rebate from the financial institution that we would not have otherwise received without the financial institutions’ involvement we also have a receivables securitization facility that allows for borrowing availability based on the eligible underlying accounts receivable and compliance with certain covenants see “ note 13 debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our receivables securitization facility and the amount outstanding under our vendor financing and commercial card programs 

cash flow activity 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2022 decreased 2595 million from fiscal 2021 primarily due to 5113 million of greater working capital usage compared to the prior year period that was partially offset by higher earnings excluding noncash impairments primarily associated with restructuring activities the greater working capital usage in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to actions taken in the prior year to preserve cash due to uncertainty during the covid pandemic such as the payment of certain bonuses and 401k match in stock in fiscal 2021 that were paid in cash in fiscal 2022 and the payment in fiscal 2022 of certain previously deferred payroll taxes that relate to relief offered under the cares act from prior years net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 increased 2092 million from fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher consolidated net income and a 1410 million net decrease in the use of working capital compared to the prior year the changes in working capital in fiscal 2022 and 2021 included a source of cash resulting from the sale of 588 million and 766 million respectively of accounts receivables in connection with the ar sales agreement as defined in note 12 fair value  as well as a similar use of cash of 32 million in fiscal 2020 

net cash used for investing activities of 7760 million in fiscal 2022 consisted primarily of 8626 million for capital expenditures that was partially offset by 608 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance and 282 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment primarily for the sale of a previously closed facility net cash used for investing activities of 6760 million in fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of 8155 million for capital expenditures that were partially offset by 585 million of proceeds from the sale of the summerville sc sawmill 449 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance and 295 million of proceeds from the sale of investments net cash used for investing activities of 9215 million in fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of 9781 million for capital expenditures that were partially offset by 350 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment and 169 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance 

 

we invested 8626 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 which is below the 10 billion we expected to invest heading into the year but in line with our revised guidance due to supply chain and other delays we expect capital expenditures of approximately 10 to 11 billion in fiscal 2023 at this level of capital investment we expect that we will continue to invest in safety environmental and maintenance projects while also making investments to support productivity and growth in our business however our capital expenditure assumptions may change project completion dates may change or we may decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify or changes in market conditions or to comply with changes in environmental laws and regulations 

in fiscal 2022 net cash used for financing activities of 12813 million consisted primarily of share repurchases of 6000 million a net decrease in debt of 4527 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders of 2595 million in fiscal 2021 net cash used for financing activities of 15804 million consisted primarily of a net decrease in debt of 12413 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders of 2338 million and stock repurchases of 1224 million in fiscal 2020 net cash used for financing activities of 10211 million consisted primarily of a net decrease in debt of 6739 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders of 3445 million 

we estimate that we will invest approximately 36 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2023 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance we were obligated to purchase approximately 371 million of fixed assets at september 30 2022 for various capital projects see item 1a “ risk factors — our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated ” 

at september 30 2022 the us federal state and foreign net operating losses and other us federal and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately 51 million in future potential reductions of us federal state and foreign cash taxes these items are primarily for foreign and state net operating losses and credits that generally will be utilized between fiscal 2023 and 2040 our cash tax rate is highly dependent on our taxable income utilization of net operating losses and credits changes in tax laws or tax rates capital expenditures and other factors barring significant changes in our current assumptions including changes in tax laws or tax rates forecasted taxable income levels of capital expenditures and other items we expect our fiscal 2023 2024 and 2025 cash tax rate will be at or driven slightly higher than our income tax rate primarily due the timing of depreciation on our qualifying capital investments as allowed under the tax cuts and jobs act 

during fiscal 2022 and 2021 we made contributions of 212 million and 232 million respectively to our us and nonus pension plans based on current facts and assumptions we expect to contribute approximately 21 million to our us and nonus pension plans in fiscal 2023 based on current assumptions including future interest rates we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our us and nonus pension plans will be approximately 21 million to 23 million annually in fiscal 2024 through 2027 we have made contributions and expect to continue to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the pension act and other regulations the net overfunded status of our us and nonus pension plans at september 30 2022 was 2378 million see “ note 5 retirement plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the normal course of business we evaluate our potential exposure to mepps including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from piumpf and central states southeast and southwest areas pension plan “ central states ” and recorded estimated withdrawal liabilities for each we also have liabilities associated with other mepps from which we or legacy companies have withdrawn from in the past in fiscal 2023 we expect to pay approximately 12 million a year in withdrawal liabilities excluding accumulated funding deficiency demands with respect to certain other mepps in the event we withdraw from one or more of the mepps in the future it is reasonably possible that we may incur withdrawal liabilities in connection with such withdrawals our estimate of any such withdrawal liability both individually and in the aggregate is not material for the remaining plans in which we participate at september 30 2022 and september 30 2021 we had withdrawal liabilities recorded of 2147 million and 2471 million respectively including liabilities associated with piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency demands the decrease in withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2022 as compared to the end of fiscal 2021 was primarily due to an increase in interest rates see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with multiemployer pension plans ” 

 

in october 2022 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0275 per share representing a 110 per share annualized dividend or an increase of 10 in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 we paid an annual dividend of 100 per share 088 per share and 133 per share respectively in may 2020 we reduced our dividend given the uncertain market conditions at the time driven by covid and we subsequently increased our dividend in may 2021 and october 2021 our goal has been to reduce debt and leverage and return capital to stockholders through a competitive annual dividend and share repurchases going forward our capital allocation strategy includes a sustainable and growing dividend 

in july 2015 our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 400 million shares of our common stock representing approximately 15 of our outstanding common stock as of july 1 2015 on may 4 2022 our board of directors authorized a new repurchase program of up to 250 million shares of our common stock plus any unutilized shares left from the july 2015 authorization the 250 million shares represent an additional authorization of approximately 10 of our outstanding common stock shares of our common stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions the timing manner price and amount of repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on factors including the market price of our common stock general economic and market conditions and applicable legal requirements the repurchase program may be commenced suspended or discontinued at any time in fiscal 2022 we repurchased approximately 126 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 5975 million in fiscal 2021 we repurchased approximately 25 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 1251 million in fiscal 2020 we repurchased no shares of our common stock the amount reflected as purchased in the consolidated statements of cash flows varies due to the timing of share settlement as of september 30 2022 we had approximately 290 million shares of common stock available for repurchase under the program 

we anticipate that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures interest payments dividends and stock repurchases pension payments working capital needs note repurchases restructuring activities repayments of current portion of longterm debt business acquisitions and other corporate actions for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from our accounts receivable sales agreements proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities or other additional longterm debt financing including new or amended facilities in addition we continually review our capital structure and conditions in the private and public debt markets in order to optimize our mix of indebtedness in connection with these reviews we may seek to refinance existing indebtedness to extend maturities reduce borrowing costs or otherwise improve the terms and composition of our indebtedness 

contractual obligations 

we summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at september 30 2022 and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table certain amounts in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans because these estimates and assumptions are subjective the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those presented in the table in millions 

 

  

1 includes only principal payments owed on our debt assuming that all of our longterm debt will be held to maturity excluding scheduled payments we have excluded 1336 million of fair value of debt stepup deferred financing costs and unamortized bond discounts from the table to arrive at actual debt obligations see “ note 13 debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the interest rates that apply to our various debt instruments 

 

 

2 see “ note 14 leases ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

3 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provision and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 

 

4 we have included future estimated minimum pension plan contributions mepp withdrawal payments with definite payout terms and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans our estimates are based on various factors such as discount rates and expected returns on plan assets future contributions are subject to changes in our funded status based on factors such as investment performance discount rates returns on plan assets and changes in legislation it is possible that our assumptions may change actual market performance may vary or we may decide to contribute different amounts we have excluded 898 million of mepp withdrawal liabilities recorded as of september 30 2022 including our estimate of the accumulated funding deficiency due to lack of definite payout terms for certain of the obligations see “ note 5 retirement plans – multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

5 we have not included the following items in the table 

• an item labeled “other longterm liabilities” reflected on our consolidated balance sheet because these liabilities do not have a defined payout schedule 

• 2534 million for certain provisions of asc 740 “ income taxes ” associated with liabilities primarily for uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of payment if any 

in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations presented in the table above we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business these contracts however are subject to change based on our business decisions on july 27 2022 we announced our entry into an agreement to acquire the remaining 677 interest in grupo gondi for 970 million plus the assumption of debt this purchase agreement is not reflected in the table above 

guarantor summarized financial information 

wrkco inc the “ issuer ” a wholly owned subsidiary of westrock company  parent  has issued the following debt securities pursuant to offerings registered under the securities act of 1933 as amended collectively for purposes of this subsection the “ notes ”in millions except percentages 

 

 upon issuance the notes maturing in 2024 2025 2027 and march 2028 were fully and unconditionally guaranteed by two other wholly owned subsidiaries of westrock company westrock rkt llc “ rkt ” and westrock mwv llc “ mwv ” and together with rkt the “ guarantor subsidiaries ” westrock company has also fully and unconditionally guaranteed these notes the remaining notes were issued by the issuer subsequent to the consummation of the acquisition of kapstone paper and packaging corporation in november 2018 and were fully and unconditionally guaranteed at the time of issuance by the parent and the guarantor subsidiaries accordingly each series of the notes is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by the parent and the guarantor subsidiaries together the “ guarantors ” collectively the issuer and the guarantors are the “ obligor group ” 

each series of notes and the related guarantees constitute unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the applicable obligor each series of notes and the related guarantees ranks equally in right of payment with all of the applicable obligor’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt ranks senior in right of payment to all of the applicable obligor’s existing and future subordinated debt is effectively junior to the applicable obligor’s 

 

existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and is structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities of each subsidiary of the applicable obligor that is not itself an obligor that does not guarantee such notes 

the indentures governing each series of notes contain covenants that among other things limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to grant liens on our assets and enter into sale and leaseback transactions in addition the indentures limit as applicable the ability of the issuer and guarantors to merge consolidate or sell convey transfer or lease our or their properties and assets substantially as an entirety the covenants contained in the indentures do not restrict the company’s ability to pay dividends or distributions to stockholders 

the guarantee obligations of the guarantors under the notes are also subject to certain limitations and terms similar to those applicable to other guarantees of similar instruments including that i the guarantees are subject to fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws and ii the obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee of each series of notes will be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the obligations of such guarantor under its guarantee of such notes not to be deemed to constitute a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law 

under each indenture governing one or more series of the notes a guarantor subsidiary will be automatically and unconditionally released from its guarantee upon consummation of any transaction permitted under the applicable indenture resulting in such guarantor subsidiary ceasing to be an obligor either as issuer or guarantor under the indentures the guarantee of the parent will be automatically released and will terminate upon the merger of the parent with or into the issuer or another guarantor the consolidation of the parent with the issuer or another guarantor or the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the parent to the issuer or a guarantor in addition if the issuer exercises its defeasance or covenant defeasance option with respect to the notes of a series in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture each guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released from its guarantee of the notes of such series and all its obligations under the applicable indenture 

the issuer and each guarantor are holding companies that conduct substantially all of their business through subsidiaries accordingly repayment of the issuer’s indebtedness including the notes is dependent on the generation of cash flow by the issuer’s and each guarantor’s subsidiaries as applicable and their ability to make such cash available to the issuer and the guarantors as applicable by dividend debt repayment or otherwise the issuer’s and the guarantors’ subsidiaries may not be able to or be permitted to make distributions to enable them to make payments in respect of their obligations including with respect to the notes in the case of the issuer and the guarantees in the case of the guarantors each of the issuer’s and the guarantors’ subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and under certain circumstances legal and contractual restrictions may limit the issuer’s and the guarantors’ ability to obtain cash from their subsidiaries in the event that the issuer and the guarantors do not receive distributions from their subsidiaries the issuer and the guarantors may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on their obligations including with respect to the notes and the guarantees 

pursuant to amended rule 310 of regulation sx the summarized financial information below is presented for the obligor group on a combined basis after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among the obligor group and equity in earnings from and investments in the nonguarantor subsidiaries the summarized financial information below should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements contained herein as the summarized financial information may not necessarily be indicative of results of operations or financial position had the subsidiaries operated as independent entities in millions

nongaap financial measures 

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “ gaap ” however management believes certain nongaap financial measures provide our management board of directors investors potential investors securities analysts and others with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance management also uses these nongaap financial measures in making financial operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our gaap results the nongaap financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies 

we use the nongaap financial measures “adjusted net income” and “adjusted earnings per diluted share” management believes these measures provide our management board of directors investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because they exclude restructuring and other costs business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business we and our board of directors use this information to evaluate our performance relative to other periods we believe that the most directly comparable gaap measures to adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share are net income loss attributable to common stockholders and earnings loss per diluted share respectively for additional information regarding our business systems transformation see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview — business systems transformation”  

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure adjusted earnings per diluted share to earnings loss per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measure in dollars per share for the periods indicated 

 

  

 

 

the gaap results in the tables below for pretax tax and net of tax are equivalent to the line items “income loss before income taxes” “income tax expense” and “consolidated net income loss” respectively as reported on the consolidated statements of operations set forth below are reconciliations of adjusted net income to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income loss attributable to common stockholders represented in the table below as the gaap results for consolidated net income loss ie net of tax less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the periods indicated in millions 

 

  

  

 

  

we discuss certain of these charges in more detail in “ note 4 restructuring and other costs ” “ note 7 segment information ” and “ note 17 commitments and contingencies — indirect tax claim ” for more information on our business systems transformation see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — overview — business systems transformation ” see item 1a “ risk factors — we may not be able to successfully implement our strategic transformation initiatives including our new business systems transformation ” 

we also use the nongaap financial measure “consolidated adjusted ebitda” along with other factors such as adjusted ebitda a gaap measure of segment performance our codm uses to evaluate our segment results to evaluate our overall performance management believes that the most directly comparable gaap measure to consolidated adjusted ebitda is net income loss attributable to common stockholders management believes this measure provides our management board of directors investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because it excludes restructuring and other costs business systems transformation costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business we and our board of directors use this information to evaluate our performance relative to other periods 

 

set forth below is a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure consolidated adjusted ebitda to net income loss attributable to common stockholders periods indicated in millions 

 

 1 the table above adds back expense or subtracts income for certain financial statement and segment footnote items to compute consolidated adjusted ebitda 

 

the nongaap measure consolidated adjusted ebitda can also be derived by adding together each segments adjusted ebitda plus nonallocated expenses from our segment footnote see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities reported certain significant accounting policies are described in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

these critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management’s most subjective and complex judgments the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts circumstances and assumptions that in management’s judgment could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and accordingly could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates 

goodwill 

we review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value as set forth in asc 350 “intangibles — goodwill and other”  asc 350   we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 

asc 350 allows an optional qualitative assessment prior to a quantitative assessment test to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we generally do not attempt a qualitative assessment and move directly to the quantitative test as part of the quantitative test we utilize the present value of expected cash flows or as appropriate a combination of the present value of expected cash flows and the guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units this present value model requires management to estimate future cash flows the timing of these cash flows and a discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions that the reporting units use for internal planning purposes which we believe would be generally consistent with that of a market participant if we determine that the estimated fair value of the 

 

reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if we determine that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value we measure the goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value as required under accounting standards update “ asu ” 201704  “ simplifying the test for goodwill impairment ” which we early adopted starting with our fiscal 2020 annual goodwill impairment test on july 1 2020 we describe our accounting policy for goodwill further in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — goodwill and longlived assets ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing we considered factors such as but not limited to our expectations for the shortterm and longterm impacts of covid macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations and financial performance including planned revenue earnings and capital investments of each reporting unit the discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 95 to 130 we used perpetual growth rates ranging from 00 to 10 all reporting units that have goodwill were noted to have a fair value that exceeded their carrying values by more than 15 each if we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis points the fair value of each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value no reporting unit failed the annual impairment test however the fair value of the corrugated packaging reporting unit only exceeded its carrying value by 15 at july 1 2022 in our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment analysis projected future cash flows for the corrugated packaging reporting unit were discounted at 100 based on the discounted cash flow model and holding other valuation assumptions constant the discount rate would have to be increased to 119 in order for the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to fall below its carrying value 

at september 30 2022 the corrugated packaging consumer packaging global paper and distribution reporting units had 28028 million 15884 million 13665 million and 1375 million of goodwill respectively our longlived assets including intangible assets remain recoverable subsequent to our annual test we monitored industry economic trends until the end of our fiscal year and determined no additional testing for goodwill impairment was warranted we have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years currently we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses however we cannot predict or control market factors including the impact of macroeconomic conditions and there are certain risks inherent to our operations as described in item 1a “ risk factors ”  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material 

see item 1a “ risk factors — we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a writedown could materially adversely impact our operating results and stockholders equity ”  

longlived assets 

we follow the provisions included in asc 360 “property plant and equipment” in determining whether the carrying value of any of our longlived assets including rightofuse assets “ rou ” and amortizable intangibles other than goodwill is impaired we review longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the longlived asset might not be recoverable if we determine that indicators of impairment are present we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the potentially impaired assets are less than the carrying value this requires management to estimate future cash flows through operations over the remaining useful life of the asset and its ultimate disposition the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions we use for internal planning purposes updated to reflect current expectations if our estimated undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the asset we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows observable prices for similar assets or other valuation techniques 

our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors market conditions and operational performance future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows which also require judgment by management 

 

accounting for income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances if any we use significant judgment in i determining whether a tax position based solely on its technical merits is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination and ii measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is “more likely than not” to be realized upon ultimate settlement we do not record any benefit for the tax positions where we do not meet the “more likely than not” initial recognition threshold income tax positions must meet a “more likely than not” recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized we generally recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations resolution of the uncertain tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or materially benefit our results of operations in future periods depending upon their ultimate resolution a 1 change in our effective tax rate would have increased or decreased tax expense by approximately 12 million for fiscal 2022 a 1 change in our effective tax rate used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets as recorded on the september 30 2022 consolidated balance sheet would have increased or decreased tax expense by approximately 117 million for fiscal 2022 

pension 

the funded status of our qualified and nonqualified us and nonus pension plans decreased 1673 million in fiscal 2022 our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans were overfunded by 2434 million as of september 30 2022 our nonus pension plans were under funded by 56 million as of september 30 2022 our us pension plan benefit obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2022 primarily by a 264basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date the nonus pension plan obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2022 by a 249basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date 

the determination of pension obligations and pension expense requires various assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts such as the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases and mortality rates for each of our plans these assumptions are determined annually in conjunction with our actuary the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts circumstances and assumptions that in management’s judgment could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and accordingly could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates 

a 25basis point change in the discount rate compensation level expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and interest crediting rate factoring in our corridor as defined herein as appropriate would have had the following effect on fiscal 2022 pension expense amounts in the table in parentheses reflect additional income in millions

 item 7a quantitative and qualitat ive disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in among other things interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices we aim to identify and understand these risks and then implement strategies to manage them when evaluating these strategies we evaluate the fundamentals of each market our sensitivity to movements in pricing and underlying accounting and business implications our chief executive officer or chief financial officer must approve the execution of all transactions contemplated in accordance with our financial and commodity risk management corporate policy the sensitivity analyses we present below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes we may not be successful in managing these risks 

containerboard and paperboard shipments 

we are exposed to market risk related to our sales of containerboard and paperboard we sell a significant portion of our mill production and converted products pursuant to contracts that provide that prices are either fixed for specified terms or provide for price adjustments based on negotiated terms including changes in specified index prices we have the capacity to annually ship approximately 111 million tons from our containerboard mills and approximately 41 million tons from our paperboard mills although our mill system operating rates may vary from year to year due to changes in market and other factors our simple average mill system operating rates for the last three years averaged 91 a hypothetical 10 per ton change in the price of containerboard and paperboard throughout the year based on our capacity would impact our sales by approximately 111 million and 41 million respectively see item 1a “ risk factors — our earnings are highly dependent on volumes ” 

energy 

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas typically measured in one million british thermal units  mmbtu  coal oil electricity diesel and wood byproducts biomass at times has fluctuated significantly in our recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and at a few mills to generate electricity used on site in our virgin fiber mills we use biomass natural gas and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates from time to time we use commodity contracts to hedge energy exposures as discussed in more detail below 

we spent approximately 1263 million and 903 million on all energy sources in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively to operate our facilities the increase in energy costs in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to inflation natural gas and electricity each account for approximately 30 to 50 of our energy purchases depending upon pricing we consumed approximately 86 million mmbtu of natural gas in fiscal 2022 although the amount of energy we consume may vary from year to year due to production levels and other factors a hypothetical 10 change in the price of energy throughout the year would impact our cost of energy by approximately 126 million based on fiscal 2022 pricing and consumption 

recycled fiber 

recycled fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of recycled paperboard and a portion of our containerboard in fiscal 2022 and 2021 we consumed approximately 57 million and 58 million tons of recycled fiber respectively recycled fiber prices can fluctuate significantly our purchases of old corrugated containers and doublelined kraft clippings account for our largest recycled fiber costs and made up approximately 85 to 90 of our recycled fiber purchases in fiscal 2022 the remaining 10 to 15 of our recycled fiber purchases consisted of a number of other grades of recycled paper the mix of recycled fiber may vary due to factors such as market demand availability and pricing recycled fiber prices increased in fiscal 2022 from prior year levels while the amount of recycled fiber we consume may vary from year to year due to production levels and other factors in fiscal 2023 we expect to consume approximately 51 million tons of recycled fiber the reduction in fiscal 2023 represents the mill actions taken in the last six months and other factors based on our estimated consumption a hypothetical 10 per ton change in recycled fiber prices for a fiscal year would impact our costs by approximately 51 million 

 

virgin fiber 

virgin fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of a portion of our containerboard bleached paperboard and market pulp while virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices they also fluctuate particularly due to significant changes in weather such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations virgin fiber prices increased in fiscal 2022 from prior year levels a hypothetical 10 change in virgin fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would impact our costs by approximately 155 million 

freight 

inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us factors that influence our freight expense include distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs primarily diesel we experienced higher freight costs and some distribution delays in both fiscal 2022 and 2021 a hypothetical 10 change in freight costs for fiscal 2022 and 2021 would impact our costs by approximately 220 million and 190 million respectively in fiscal 2023 we expect to consume approximately 85 million gallons of diesel see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

interest rates 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our shortterm and longterm debt as discussed below we may from time to time use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at september 30 2022 and 2021 including the impact of any interest rate swaps if market interest rates change an average of 100 basis points our annual interest expense would be impacted by approximately 10 million and 11 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs this analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment see item 1a “ risk factors — we have had significant levels of indebtedness in the past and may incur significant levels of indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ” 

derivative instruments  forward contracts 

we periodically may issue and settle foreign currency denominated debt exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates on open balances at each balance sheet date from time to time we may use foreign exchange contracts to hedge these exposures with terms of generally one to three months at september 30 2022 the notional amount of our foreign currency exchange contract derivative was 80 billion mexican pesos 3899 million at september 30 2021 the notional amount of our foreign currency exchange contract derivative was 2702 million based on our open foreign exchange contracts as of september 30 2022 and september 30 2021 the effect of a 1 change in exchange rates would impact other expense income net by approximately 4 million and 3 million respectively although these foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the foreign currency denominated debt exposures the fluctuation of these instruments may cause future cash settlement of the hedge 

we periodically may also enter into interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our outstanding debt but currently have no active interest rate swaps interest rate swaps are either designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of forecasted floating interest payments on variable rate debt or fair value hedges of fixed rate debt or we may elect not to treat them as accounting hedges we may enter into swaps or forward contracts on certain commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases or sales of those commodities 

in fiscal 2022 we entered into various natural gas commodity derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes therefore the entire change in fair value of the financial derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period or periods during which the forecasted 

 

transaction affects earnings at september 30 2022 the notional amount of our natural gas commodity derivatives was 183 million mmbtu based on our open contracts as of september 30 2022 the effect of a 10 change in the price per mmbtu would impact cost of goods sold by approximately 1 million see “ note 18 accumulated other comprehensive loss and other comprehensive income loss ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our natural gas commodity derivatives 

pension plans 

our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment among other factors adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities during fiscal 2022 and 2021 factoring in our corridor as appropriate the effect of a 025 decrease in the discount rate would have reduced pretax income by approximately 8 million and 15 million respectively during fiscal 2022 and 2021 the effect of a 025 increase in the discount rate would have decreased pretax income by 5 million and increased pretax income by 15 million respectively similarly mepps in which we participate could experience similar circumstances which could impact our funding requirements and therefore expenses see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with multiemployer pension plans ” 

foreign currency 

we predominately operate in markets in the us but derived 183 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers although we are impacted by the exchange rates of a number of currencies our largest exposures are generally to the brazilian real british pound canadian dollar euro and mexican peso in fiscal 2022 our largest exposures also included the polish zloty chinese yuan and japanese yen 

in conducting our foreign operations we also make intercompany sales and receive royalties and dividends denominated in different currencies these activities expose us to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates flows of foreign currencies into and out of our operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements 

at times certain of our foreign subsidiaries have us dollardenominated external debt in these instances we may hedge the nonfunctional currency exposure with derivatives we issue intercompany loans to and receive foreign cash deposits from our foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates from deposits from time to time we may use foreignexchange hedge contracts with terms of generally less than one year to hedge these exposures although our derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the matched exposures 

during fiscal 2022 and 2021 the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies to which we have exposure compared to the us dollar would have impacted our income before income taxes by approximately 36 million and 26 million respectively 

during fiscal 2022 and 2021 the effect of a hypothetical 1 change in exchange rates would have impacted accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately 32 million and 30 million respectively this impact does not consider the effects of a stronger or weaker us dollar on our ability to compete for export business or the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment changes in foreign exchange rates could impact the price and the demand for our products for instance a strengthening us dollar may cause exports to become more expensive to foreign customers and business that have to pay for them in other currencies see item 1a “ risk factors — we have been and may be in the future adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ”

we report our financial results of operations in the following two reportable segments corrugated packaging which consists of our containerboard mills corrugated packaging and distribution operations as well as our merchandising displays and recycling procurement operations and consumer packaging which consists of our consumer mills food and beverage and partition operations prior to the completion of our monetization program in fiscal 2020 we had a third reportable segment land and development which previously sold real estate primarily in the charleston sc region following completion of the monetization of these assets we ceased reporting the results of the land and development segment as a separate segment 

products

corrugated packaging segment

we are one of the largest integrated producers of linerboard and corrugating medium “ containerboard ” corrugated products and specialty papers including kraft papers and saturating kraft in north america measured by tons produced one of the largest producers of highgraphics preprinted linerboard measured by net sales in north america and one of the largest manufacturers of temporary promotional pointofpurchase displays in north america measured by net sales we have integrated corrugated operations in north america brazil and india we believe we are one of the largest paper recyclers in north america and our recycling operations provide substantially all of the recycled fiber that we consume to our containerboard and paperboard mills as well as to third parties our brazil operations own and operate forestlands that provide virgin fiber to our mill in brazil

we operate an integrated corrugated packaging system that manufactures primarily containerboard corrugated sheets corrugated packaging and preprinted linerboard for sale to consumer and industrial products manufacturers and corrugated box manufacturers we produce a full range of highquality corrugated containers designed to protect ship store promote and display products made to our customers’ merchandising and distribution specifications we convert corrugated sheets into corrugated products ranging from onecolor 

 

protective cartons to graphically brilliant pointofpurchase packaging our corrugated container plants serve local customers and regional and large national accounts corrugated packaging is used to provide protective packaging for shipment and distribution of food paper health and beauty and other household consumer commercial and industrial products corrugated packaging may also be graphically enhanced for retail sale particularly in club store locations we provide customers with innovative packaging solutions to help them promote and sell their products we provide structural and graphic design engineering services and custom proprietary and standard automated packaging machines offering customers turnkey installation automation line integration and packaging solutions we offer a machinery solution that creates pouches that replace singleuse plastics including bubble mailers we also distribute corrugated packaging materials and other specialty packaging products including stretch film void fill carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes through our network of warehouses and distribution facilities to make corrugated sheet stock we feed linerboard and corrugating medium into a corrugator that flutes the medium to specified sizes glues the linerboard and fluted medium together and slits and cuts the resulting corrugated paperboard into sheets to customer specifications our containerboard mills and corrugated container operations are integrated with the majority of our containerboard production used internally by our corrugated container operations the balance is either used in trade swaps with other manufacturers or sold domestically and internationally 

we design manufacture and in certain cases pack temporary displays for sale to consumer products companies and retailers these displays are used as marketing tools to support new product introductions and specific product promotions in mass merchandising stores supermarkets convenience stores home improvement stores and other retail locations we also design manufacture and in some cases preassemble permanent displays for these customers we make temporary displays primarily from corrugated paperboard unlike temporary displays permanent displays are restocked with our customers’ product therefore they are constructed primarily from metal plastic wood and other durable materials we provide contract packing services such as multiproduct promotional packing and product manipulation such as multipacks and onpacks we manufacture and distribute point of sale material utilizing litho screen and digital printing technologies we manufacture lithographic laminated packaging for sale to our customers that require packaging with high quality graphics and strength characteristics

our recycling operations primarily procure recovered paper also known as recycled fiber from our converting facilities and from third parties such as factories warehouses commercial printers office complexes grocery and retail stores document storage facilities paper converters and other wastepaper collectors we handle a wide variety of grades of recovered paper including old corrugated containers office paper box clippings newspaper and print shop scraps we operate recycling facilities that collect sort grade and bale recovered paper and after sorting and baling we transfer it to our containerboard and paperboard mills for processing or sell it principally to manufacturers of paperboard or containerboard in the united states “ us ” as well as manufacturers of tissue newsprint roofing products and insulation and to export markets we operate a nationwide fiber marketing and brokerage system that serves large regional and national accounts as well as our containerboard and paperboard mills and sells scrap materials from our converting businesses and mills many of our recycling facilities are located close to our containerboard and paperboard mills which helps promote the availability of supply with reduced shipping costs we conduct our recycling operations as a procurement function focusing on the procurement of low cost high quality recycled fiber for our mill system and therefore we do not record recycling net sales and the margin from these operations has reduced cost of goods sold 

sales of corrugated packaging products to external customers accounted for 654 646 and 642 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information

consumer packaging segment

we operate integrated virgin and recycled fiber paperboard mills and consumer packaging converting operations which convert items such as folding cartons interior partitions inserts and labels our integrated system of virgin and recycled mills produces paperboard for our converting operations and third parties we internally consume or sell to manufacturers of folding cartons and other paperboard products our coated natural kraft bleached paperboard and coated recycled paperboard and internally consume or sell to manufacturers of solid fiber interior packaging tubes and cores book covers and other paperboard products our specialty recycled paperboard the mill owned by our seven hills paperboard llc “ seven hills ” joint venture in lynchburg va manufactures gypsum paperboard liner for sale to our joint venture partner

 

we are one of the largest manufacturers of folding cartons in north america we believe we are the largest manufacturer of solid fiber partitions in north america measured by net sales our folding cartons are used to package items such as food paper beverages dairy products tobacco confectionery health and beauty and other household consumer commercial and industrial products primarily for retail sale our folding cartons are also used by our customers to attract consumer attention at the pointofsale we manufacture express mail packages for the overnight courier industry provide inserts and labels as well as rigid packaging and other printed packaging products such as transaction cards eg credit debit etc brochures product literature marketing materials such as booklets folders inserts cover sheets and slipcases and grower tags and plant stakes for the horticultural market for the global healthcare market we manufacture paperboard packaging for overthecounter and prescription drugs our customers generally use our inserts and labels to provide customer product information either inside a secondary package eg a folding carton or affixed to the outside of a primary package eg a bottle folding cartons typically protect customers’ products during shipment and distribution and employ graphics to promote them at retail we manufacture folding cartons from recycled and virgin paperboard laminated paperboard and various substrates with specialty characteristics such as grease masking and microwaveability we print coat diecut and glue the cartons to customer specifications and ship finished cartons to customers for assembling filling and sealing we employ a broad range of offset flexographic gravure backside printing coating and finishing technologies as well as iridescent holographic textured and dimensional effects to provide differentiated packaging products and support our customers with new package development innovation and design services and package testing services we manufacture and sell our solid fiber and corrugated partitions and diecut paperboard components principally to glass container manufacturers producers of beer food wine spirits cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and the automotive industry 

sales of consumer packaging products to external customers accounted for 346 353 and 357 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information

land and development segment

during fiscal 2020 we completed the monetization of the various real estate holdings that we owned that were concentrated in the charleston sc region sales in our land and development segment to external customers accounted for 01 and 01 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” for additional information following completion of the monetization of these assets we ceased reporting the results of the land and development segment as a separate segment

seasonality

while our businesses are not materially impacted by seasonality there is some variability in demand that occurs from quarter to quarter with net sales in the first quarter of each fiscal year typically being the lowest as such we disclose net sales segment income and shipment data by segment by quarter in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” generally we expect more of our earnings and cash flows to be generated in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half of the fiscal year due to these variations and other factors including the timing of scheduled mill maintenance outages

raw materials

the primary raw materials used by our mill operations are recycled fiber at our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills and virgin fiber from hardwoods and softwoods at our virgin containerboard and paperboard mills certain of our virgin containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content our overall fiber sourcing for all of our mills is approximately 65 virgin and 35 recycled see “ item 2 properties ” for additional information recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate significantly

containerboard and paperboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations our converting operations use many different grades of containerboard and paperboard we supply substantially all of our converting operations needs for containerboard and paperboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps with other manufacturers these arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs because there are other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of containerboard and paperboard used in our converting operations we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from other suppliers in the event that we incur production disruptions for recycled or virgin containerboard and 

 

paperboard see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ”  

energy

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas coal oil electricity and wood byproducts biomass at times has fluctuated significantly in our coated and uncoated recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity to generate steam used in the paper making process in our integrated kraft paper mills we use natural gas biomass fuel oil and some coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates see item 1 “ business — governmental regulation — environmental ” for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ”  see also item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — “energy” and “derivative instruments  forward contracts” for additional information regarding our energy consumption

transportation

inbound and outbound freight is a significant cost for us factors that influence our freight expense are distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from our facilities to our customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs we experienced higher freight costs in fiscal 2021 following a decline in fiscal 2020 the principal markets for our products are in north america south america europe asia and australia see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

sales and marketing

none of our external customers individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021 we generally manufacture our products pursuant to our customers’ orders we believe that we have good relationships with our customers see item 1a “ risk factors — we depend on certain large customers ” 

as a result of our vertical integration our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products during fiscal 2021 approximately twothirds of our coated natural kraft tons shipped approximately threefifths of our coated recycled paperboard tons shipped and approximately onefifth of our bleached paperboard tons shipped were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture folding cartons and approximately fourfifths of our containerboard tons shipped including trade swaps and buysell transactions were delivered to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products under the terms of our seven hills joint venture arrangement our joint venture partner is required to purchase all of the qualifying gypsum paperboard liner produced by seven hills excluding the production from seven hills and from our aurora il mill which is converted into book covers and other products approximately onethird of our specialty recycled paperboard tons shipped in fiscal 2021 were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture interior partitions we have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our operations

as a result of our broad portfolio of differentiated and sustainable paper and packaging solutions we serve more than 15000 customers including 188 customers who bought at least 1 million from each of our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments in fiscal 2021 we believe that our ability to leverage our full portfolio of differentiated solutions and capabilities enables us to set ourselves apart from our competitors

we market our products primarily through our own sales force we also market a number of our products through independent sales representatives and independent distributors we generally pay our sales personnel a combination of base salary commissions and annual bonus we pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis orders from our customers generally do not have significant lead times we discuss foreign net sales to unaffiliated customers and other nonus operations’ financial and other segment information in “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 

competition 

we operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large well established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions including industry capacity changes global competition economic conditions in the us and abroad as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and no single company dominates any of those industries our containerboard and paperboard operations compete with integrated and nonintegrated national and regional companies operating primarily in north america and to a limited extent manufacturers outside of north america our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies in the corrugated packaging and folding carton markets we compete with a significant number of national regional and local packaging suppliers in north america and abroad in the solid fiber interior packaging promotional pointofpurchase display and converted paperboard products markets we primarily compete with a smaller number of national regional and local companies offering highly specialized products 

since all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly discuss sales opportunities for new business or for renewal of existing business with customers our packaging products compete with packaging made from other materials including plastics the primary competitive factors we face include price design product innovation quality service and sustainability with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences our machinery solutions represent one example of how we compete by providing differentiated solutions that create value for our customers we believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and we obtain feedback on our performance with periodic customer surveys among other means

the industries in which we operate have undergone consolidation within the packaging products industry larger customers with an expanded geographic presence have tended to seek suppliers that can because of their broad geographic presence efficiently and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs in addition our customers continue to demand higher quality products meeting stricter quality control requirements increasing demand for more sustainable products is also impacting our industry see item 1 “ business — sustainability ” for additional information

see item 1a “ risk factors — we face intense competition ” and “risk factors — we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ” 

governmental regulation

health and safety

our business involves the use of heavy equipment machinery and chemicals and requires the performance of activities that create safety exposures the health and safety of our teammates is our most important responsibility and our goal is to create a 100 safe work environment for our team members our safety strategy focuses on people process prevention and performance we seek to reduce exposures and eliminate life changing events through engagement execution of targeted resultsdriven activities and implementing systems that promote continuous improvement our commitment to safety is reinforced by our use of the westrock safety excellence management system a robust safety program and training curriculum 

we are subject to a broad range of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety and our safety program includes measures required for compliance we have incurred and will continue to incur capital expenditures to meet our health and safety compliance requirements as well as to continually improve our safety systems we believe that future compliance with occupational health and safety laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

the global impact of the covid19 pandemic “ covid19 ” continues to evolve a nd the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance in future periods will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic including due to new variants such as delta the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact including the 

 

distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures and government responses among others 

on september 9 2021 the biden administration announced a plan directing the occupational safety and health administration “ osha ” to issue an emergency temporary standard “ ets ” requiring all private employers with 100 or more workers to mandate covid19 vaccinations or a weekly test for all employees the ets was issued on november 5 2021 on november 12 2021 the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit issued an order staying enforcement and implementation of the ets we are assessing the anticipated requirements and monitoring future developments we cannot currently assess the impact it will have on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows and it is possible that the operational impact and cost of compliance with the ets may be substantial see item 1a “ risk factors — our business has been and will continue to be impacted by the outbreak of the covid19 novel coronavirus ”  

certain governmental authorities in locations where we do business have established asbestos standards for the workplace although we do not use asbestos in manufacturing our products asbestos containing material “ acm ” is present in some of the facilities we lease or own for those facilities where acm is present and acm is subject to regulation we have established procedures for properly managing it 

environmental

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ manufacturing processes that involve discharges to water air emissions water intake and waste handling and disposal activities these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various governmental authorities complex and lengthy processes may be required to obtain and renew approvals permits and licenses for new existing or modified facilities additionally the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency response procedures our integrated chemical pulping mills in the us and brazil are subject to numerous and more complex environmental programs and regulations but all of our manufacturing facilities have environmental compliance obligations we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations including for example projects to replace andor upgrade our air pollution control devices wastewater treatment systems and other environmental infrastructure changes in these laws as well as litigation relating to these laws could result in more stringent or additional environmental compliance obligations for the company that may require additional capital investments or increase our operating costs

we are involved in various administrative and other proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business and we may become involved in similar matters in the future although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information we do not believe that the currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

we face potential liability under federal state local and international laws as a result of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment from various sites owned and operated by third parties at which companygenerated wastes have allegedly been deposited generators of hazardous substances sent to offsite disposal locations at which environmental contamination exists as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are liable for response costs for the investigation and remediation of such sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “ cercla ” and analogous laws while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla liability is typically shared with other potentially responsible parties “ prps ” and costs are commonly allocated according to relative amounts of waste deposited and other factors

in addition certain of our current or former locations are being investigated or remediated under various environmental laws including cercla based on information known to us and assumptions we do not believe that the costs of these investigation and remediation projects will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows however the discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations including natural resources damages at these or other sites in the future could impact our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 

we believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under certain purchase and other agreements in connection with certain remediation sites in addition we believe that we have insurance coverage subject to applicable deductibles or retentions policy limits and other conditions for certain environmental matters however there can be no assurance that we will be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights or that if we are successful any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights will be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses we also cannot predict with certainty whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at other locations and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed current reserves in addition we cannot currently assess with certainty the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or federal state or other environmental laws regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

see item 1a “ risk factors — we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs ” 

we estimate that we will invest approximately 21 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions and project completion dates may change and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects or changes in environmental laws and regulations

climate change 

some of our paper mills our most energyintensive manufacturing facilities burn renewable biomass to generate more than 60 percent of their energy needs based on overall fuel mix most of these facilities also selfgenerate the steam and power needed for their manufacturing processes using combined heat and power or “cogeneration” systems our recycling operations help to divert approximately seven to eight million tons of paper and packaging from landfills where it would otherwise degrade and release greenhouse gases in the form of methane our fiber procurement activities create economic incentives for landowners and family tree farmers to maintain their holdings as working forests that sequester carbon and provide many other environmental benefits including protection for fresh water supplies and habitats for diverse species of plants and animals 

 

in 2015 we established a goal to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions per ton of production by 20 from a 2015 baseline by 2025 as of our september 30 2020 reporting we achieved a 14 reduction of greenhouse gas “ ghg ” per ton of production and an absolute reduction of 22 from our baseline we have accomplished ghg reductions in our business primarily by displacing coal with natural gas and investing in new biomass boilers at our covington va and demopolis al mills in june 2021 the company announced that it will be working with the science based targets initiative “ sbti ” to set a new ghg emissions reduction target that is aligned with current climate science 

 

our executive leadership team is actively involved in setting and executing our sustainability strategy including climaterelated initiatives such as setting a sciencebased ghg target boardlevel oversight of climaterelated and other corporate sustainability matters resides with the nominating  governance committee of the company’s board of directors the corporate sustainability team works with the company’s operational and functional groups to incorporate sustainability and climate objectives into operations the team also oversees the development of our sustainability report which includes data on performance against climaterelated targets the corporate sustainability team reports to the president innovation commercial  sustainability who reports to the chief executive officer

 

addressing issues related to climate change presents opportunities for our business for example we produce renewable energy and generate renewable energy credits “ recs ” at our integrated kraft mills we have sold recs in the past and may sell them in the future the recs we generate are flexible marketbased tools that support the renewable energy market our recycling activities also may present the opportunity to generate offsets that could be used to meet climaterelated obligations for ourselves or others

 

climate change also presents potential risks and uncertainties for us with respect to physical climate risks our manufacturing operations may be impacted by weatherrelated events such as hurricanes and floods potentially resulting in lost production supply chain disruptions and increased material costs unpredictable weather patterns also may impact virgin fiber supplies and prices which may fluctuate during prolonged periods of 

 

heavy rain or drought on the other hand changes in climate also could result in more accommodating weather patterns for greater periods of time in certain areas which may create favorable fiber market conditions we incorporate a review of meteorological forecast data into our fiber procurement decisions and strategies to the extent that climaterelated risks materialize and we are unprepared for them we may incur unexpected costs which could have a material effect on our financial results of operations 

responses to climate change may result in regulatory risks as new laws and regulations aimed at reducing ghg emissions come into effect these rules and regulations could take the form of capandtrade carbon taxes or ghg reductions mandates for utilities that could increase the cost of purchased electricity new climate rules and regulations also may result in higher fossil fuel prices or fuel efficiency standards that could increase transportation costs certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have already taken actions to address climate change in the us the epa has issued the clean air act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit ghg the epa also has promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to file an annual report of their emissions while we have facilities subject to existing ghg permitting and reporting requirements the impact of these requirements has not been material to date

in addition to these national efforts some us states in which we have manufacturing operations including washington new york and virginia are taking measures to reduce ghg emissions such as requiring ghg emissions reporting or developing regional capandtrade programs in addition several of our international facilities are located in countries that have already adopted ghg emissions trading programs other countries in which we conduct business including china european union member states and india have set ghg reduction targets in accordance with the agreement signed in april 2016 among over 170 countries that established a framework for reducing global ghg emissions also known as the “ paris agreement ” which became effective in november 2016 and to which the united states formally rejoined in february 2021

regulation related to climate change continues to develop in the areas of the world where we conduct business we have systems in place for tracking the ghg emissions from our energyintensive facilities and we carefully monitor developments in climate related laws regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and disclosure obligations compliance with climate programs may require future expenditures to meet ghg emission reduction obligations in future years these obligations may include carbon taxes the requirement to purchase ghg credits or the need to acquire carbon offsets also we may be required to make capital and other investments to displace traditional fossil fuels such as fuel oil and coal with lower carbon alternatives such as biomass and natural gas

human capital

human capital management 

the attraction retention and development of exceptional teammates is critical to our success we accomplish this in part by developing the capabilities of our team members through our continuous learning development and performance management programs these programs include our safety six sigma supply chain leadership excellence commercial excellence and manager fundamentals programs we sponsor early in career rotations and college hire programs that support our functions and local operations we build partnerships with schools universities and associations to promote future careers in manufacturing

the capabilities of our workforce have evolved as our business and strategy have evolved we have established new roles reflecting the talent and capabilities needed by our business both now and for what we expect in the future we created the roles of chief commercial officer and chief innovation officer reflecting our evolving gotomarket strategy and our focus on innovation and organic growth we invested in roles and 

 

capabilities in our workforce to support our business strategy including hiring a new chief marketing officer chief sustainability officer and senior vice president of science and innovation we have invested in our ecommerce and digital technology capabilities through new roles talent and programs these investments reflect our focus on enhancing our capabilities in the areas of sustainability organic growth innovation and material science as our business evolves we will remain focused on having the right human capital capabilities systems and processes in place to support our strategy

culture

westrock’s culture is grounded in our values









 

at the core of our employee listening systems is our biannual engagement survey which is augmented with employee pulse checks after hire and promotion and exit interviewssurveys these pulse checkssurveys enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally approximately 86 of team members globally participated in our fiscal 2021 westrock engagement survey which covers topics such as company strategy and direction leadership inclusion safety culture pay and benefits and learning and development

safety

the health and safety of our teammates is our most important responsibility and our goal is to create a 100 safe work environment for our team members throughout the covid19 crisis we have remained focused on protecting the health and safety of our team members while meeting the needs of our customers shortly after the outset of covid19 we were an early adopter of enhanced safety measures and practices across our facilities to protect employee health and safety and ensure a reliable supply of essential products to our customers we monitor and track the impact of the pandemic on our teammates and within our operations and proactively modify or adopt new practices to promote their health and safety

we implemented a wide variety of measures to protect the health and wellbeing of our employees suppliers and customers during the covid19 pandemic we made substantial modifications to travel policies and implemented office and manufacturing protocols to include quarantine cleaning and sanitizing and childcare support we reconfigured manufacturing processes and lines to create distance and improved ventilation where needed we also provided onsite flu and covid vaccination clinics and extended our existing employee assistance program and other community resources to help with personal and family care see item 1 “ business — governmental regulation — health  safety ” for more information on safety

diversity inclusion equity and belonging

our diversity inclusion equity and belonging objective is to be a company where each of us genuinely belongs is respected and valued and can do our best work and where diversity inclusion and equity are competitive advantages

at september 30 2021 21 of our global workforce was comprised of females and 33 of our us based workforce was comprised of people of color our board of directors includes four females representing 36 of directors and one person of color representing 9 of directors we have implemented a multiyear diversity inclusion equity and belonging action plan that we expect will increase our workforce diversity advance inclusion 

 

equity and belonging at all our locations accelerate the development and career movement of diverse talent and ensure diverse succession plans such that we continue to create future opportunities for all of our teammates for instance in october 2020 management recommended and the board of directors approved several actions aimed at increasing our diversity and advancing our inclusive environment one program that has contributed to our overall progress involves the internal and external posting of our open positions and the inclusion of female and racially or ethnically diverse candidates on our recruitment slates in addition we adopted an approach where new managementsupported director nominees and chief executive officers recruited from outside westrock are chosen by the board of directors we set a fouryear goal for gender and ethnic representation that aligns with our longterm expectations for creating a truly diverse and inclusive organization – one that reflects our customers and communities 

we included a diversity inclusion equity and belonging modifier in our fiscal 2021 shortterm incentive plan for our top 12 executives the modifier was tied to the achievement of certain performance measures under our diversity inclusion equity and belonging action plan we expect the diversity inclusion equity and belonging modifier to be applied to approximately 100 of our top executives and leaders in fiscal 2022

in collaboration with organizations such as the executive leadership council pathways and signature we are providing external development opportunities for our diverse talent to connect and develop team members within westrock we support highly engaged resource groups for early in career women racial and ethnic minorities military people with different abilities or who identify as lgbtqi where team members can go for support networking and communitybuilding

we conduct pay equity analyses annually in the us great britain and france to help identify any unsupported distinctions in pay between team members of different races gender andor age as permitted by local law we adjust base pay where appropriate

talent attraction retention and development

during fiscal 2021 we continued investing in people programs and systems to meet the increased talent demand in a dynamic marketplace we have expanded our relationships with historically black colleges and universities the national association of manufacturers and other partners and associations to retain critical operational talent in hyper labor markets and businesses we have restructured work schedules updated work rules and provided retention bonuses where needed

to ensure team members get off to a fast start we provided new employee orientations to over 10000 new hires in fiscal 2021 covering a range of topics including company values culture diversity and inclusion and standards of business conduct in fiscal 2021 westrock launched our online learning library with over 1000 courses in five languages and with over 200 playlists by topic area or experienceskill set

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more occur could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock par value 001 per share “ common stock ” in evaluating us our business and a potential investment in our securities you should consider the following risk factors and the other information presented in this report as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec the risks addressed below are not the only ones we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely impact our business

industry risks

we may experience pricing variability

our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue experiencing cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product prices for our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in the industries within which we compete and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which may be unpredictable and volatile if supply exceeds demand prices for our products could decline and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected for example we believe that the trading price of our common stock has been adversely affected in the past due in part to concerns about announcements by certain of our competitors of planned additional capacity in the north american containerboard market as well as the subsequent implementation of certain of those plans

certain published indices including those published by pulp and paper week “ ppw ” contribute to the setting of selling prices for some of our products ppw is a limited survey that may not accurately reflect changes in market conditions for our products changes in how ppw is maintained or other indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the selling prices for these products

our earnings are highly dependent on volumes

because our operations generally have high fixed operating cost components our earnings are highly dependent on volumes which tend to fluctuate these fluctuations make it difficult to predict our financial results with any degree of certainty the covid19 pandemic has affected our operational and financial performance to varying degrees and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance will continue to depend on 

 

future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic including due to new variants such as delta the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact including the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures and government responses among others any failure to maintain volumes may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation

we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials energy sources and thirdparty companies to transport our goods

the costs of recycled fiber and virgin fiber the principal externally sourced raw materials for our paper mills are subject to pricing variability due to market and industry conditions demand for recycled fiber has fluctuated and may increase due to among other factors increased consumption of recycled fiber including through additions of new recycled paper mill capacity increasing demand for products packaged in packaging produced from paper manufactured from 100 recycled fiber and the shift by manufacturers of virgin paperboard tissue newsprint and corrugated packaging to the production of products with some recycled fiber content in 2021 we experienced periods of increased recycled fiber costs due primarily to market demand and availability

the market price of virgin fiber varies based on availability and source of virgin fiber and the availability of virgin fiber may be impacted by among other factors wet weather conditions in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations fluctuate which impacts our manufacturing costs certain published indices contribute to price setting for some of our raw materials and future changes in how these indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the pricing of these raw materials

the cost of natural gas which we use in many of our manufacturing operations including many of our mills and other energy costs including energy generated by burning natural gas fuel oil biomass and coal has at times fluctuated significantly in fiscal 2021 the price of the natural gas that we consume in our manufacturing operations increased significantly compared to the prior year period energy costs have increased and in the future could increase our operating costs and have made and in the future could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors

we distribute our products primarily by truck and rail although we also distribute some of our products by cargo ship the reduced availability of trucks rail cars or cargo ships could adversely impact our ability to distribute our products in a timely manner in fiscal 2021 we experienced significantly higher freight costs compared to freight costs incurred in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 high transportation costs have made and in the future could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors 

because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the cost of raw materials energy or transportation through price increases for our products the failure to obtain raw materials energy or transportation services at reasonable market prices or the failure to pass on price increases to our customers or a reduction in the availability of raw materials energy or transportation services due to increased demand significant changes in climate or weather conditions or other factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we face intense competition

we compete in industries that are highly competitive our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies we generally compete with companies operating in north america although we have operations spanning north america south america europe asia and australia factors affecting our ability to compete include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors’ pricing strategies the introduction by our competitors of new technologies and equipment our ability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our ability to maintain the costefficiency of our facilities in addition changes within these industries including the consolidation of our competitors and customers may impact competitive dynamics if our competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected

 

our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal customer shifts away from containerboard and paperboard packaging to packaging made from other materials could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

operating risks

our business has been and will continue to be impacted by the outbreak of the covid19 novel coronavirus

 

the global impact of covid19 continues to evolve covid19 has impacted our operations and financial performance to varying degrees and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance in future periods will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic including due to new variants such as delta the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact including the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures and government responses among others

in response to the spread of covid19 governmental authorities implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace and work from home orders and shutdowns of socalled “nonessential” businesses these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations as well as those of our customers vendors and suppliers that in turn may impact us we have manufacturing operations in the us canada brazil mexico australia china and in europe and each of these countries or regions has been affected by the outbreak of covid19 and taken various measures to try to contain it among other impacts to our business from the outbreak of covid19



our business has been and will continue to be impacted by covid19 and these impacts may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial conditions and the trading price of our common stock

 

we may be unsuccessful in making and integrating mergers acquisitions and investments and completing divestitures 

we have completed a number of mergers acquisitions investments and divestitures in the past and we may acquire invest in or sell or enter into joint ventures with additional companies we may not be able to identify suitable targets or purchasers or successfully complete suitable transactions in the future and completed transactions may not be successful these transactions create risks including but not limited to risks associated with



mergers acquisitions and investments may not be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers that place higher strategic value on these businesses and assets than we do for acquisitions our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of realizing them depend on the successful integration of the acquired businesses and operations with our business and operations even if we integrate these businesses and operations successfully we may not realize the full benefits we expected within the anticipated timeframe or at all and the benefits may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays

we may incur business disruptions

the operations at our manufacturing facilities have in the past and may in the future be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks including but not limited to risks associated with



 



for example operations at several of our facilities located in the south and southeastern us have been interrupted in recent years by hurricanes and severe winter weather resulting in among other things lost mill production

business disruptions have impaired and may in the future impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences

our success depends in part on our ability to offer differentiated solutions and we must continually develop and introduce new products and services to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments and changing customer preferences the services and products that we offer customers may not meet their needs as their business models evolve also our customers may decide to decrease their use of our products use alternative materials for their product packaging or forego the packaging of certain products entirely regulatory developments can also significantly alter the market for our products for example a move to electronic distribution of disclaimers and other paperless regimes could adversely impact our healthcare inserts and labels businesses similarly certain states and local governments have adopted laws banning singleuse paper bags or charging businesses or customers fees to use paper bags these and similar developments could adversely impact demand for certain of our products

consumer preferences for products and packaging formats are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience and health environmental and social concerns and perceptions for example changing consumer dietary habits and preferences have slowed the sales growth for certain of the food and beverage products that we package also there is an increasing focus among consumers to ensure that products delivered through ecommerce are packaged efficiently for instance in 2019 amazon began requiring all items sold through amazon that are larger than a specified size to be designed and certified as readytoship our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences

our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated

we regularly make capital expenditures and many of our capital projects are complex costly andor implemented over an extended period of time our capital expenditures for particular capital projects could be higher than we anticipated we may experience unanticipated business disruptions andor we may not achieve the desired benefits from the capital projects any of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in addition disputes between us and contractors who are involved with implementing capital projects could lead to timeconsuming and costly litigation

we are exposed to risks related to international sales and operations

we derived 185 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected by risks related to the countries outside the us in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil china mexico and india are exposed to varying degrees of economic political and social instability in addition these countries’ economies and operating environments have been and likely will continue to be adversely impacted to varying degrees by covid19 we are exposed to risks of operating in those countries as well as others including but not limited to risks associated with



 



we are also subject to taxation in the us and numerous nonus jurisdictions and have several ongoing audit examinations covering multiple years with various tax authorities we base our tax returns on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations in effect however governing tax bodies may disagree with certain of our tax positions which could result in a higher tax liability

any one or more of these risks could adversely affect our international operations and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we cannot operate our joint ventures solely for our benefit which subjects us to risks

we have invested in joint ventures and may form additional joint ventures in the future our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks including but not limited to risks associated with



we may produce faulty or contaminated products due to failures in quality control measures and systems

our failure to produce products that meet safety and quality standards could result in adverse effects on consumer health litigation exposure loss of market share and adverse financial impacts among other potential consequences and we may incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action up to and including recalling products from end consumers and to reimburse customers andor end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of these failures our actions or omissions with respect to product safety and quality could lead to regulatory investigations enforcement actions andor prosecutions and result in adverse publicity which may damage our reputation any of these results could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

 

we provide guarantees or representations in certain of our contracts that our products are produced in accordance with customer specifications if the product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated the manufacturer of the product may allege that the packaging we provided caused the fault or contamination even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications if our packaging fails to function properly or to preserve the integrity of its contents we could face liability from our customers and third parties for bodily injury or other damages these liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we depend on certain large customers

we have large customers the loss of which could adversely affect our sales and depending on the significance of the loss our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in particular because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly bid for new business or for the renewal of existing business the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may adversely impact our financial results

we are subject to cybersecurity risks including related to customer employee vendor or other company data

we use information technologies to securely manage operations and various business functions we rely on various technologies some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information in addition we facilitate a variety of business processes and activities including reporting on our business and interacting with customers vendors and employees we also collect and store data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls our systems are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information manipulate data or disrupt our operations despite our security design and controls and those of our thirdparty providers we have in the past experienced and may in the future become subject to system damage disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes including cyberattacks data breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages telecommunication or utility failures systems failures service provider failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events for example in january 2021 we detected a ransomware attack impacting certain of our systems the “ ransomware incident ” in response we proactively shutdown a number of our systems which impacted certain of our operations including our ability to produce and ship paper and packaging due to these actions our mill system production was approximately 115000 tons lower than planned for the quarter ended march 31 2021 and we estimate the pretax income impact of the lost sales and operational disruption of this incident as well as ransomware recovery costs at approximately 80 million in response to the ransomware incident we accelerated information technology investments that we had previously planned to make in future periods in order to further strengthen our information security and technology infrastructure as a result we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs as we enhance our data security and take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to or manipulation of our systems and data despite these efforts we may not have identified and remediated all of the potential causes of the ransomware incident and similar incidents may occur in the future in particular the ransomware incident may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems

the cybersecurityrelated vulnerabilities that we face may also remain undetected for an extended period of time we may face other challenges and risks during our integration of acquired businesses and operations as we upgrade and standardize our information technology systems we maintain contingency plans and processes to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events however these events could result in operational disruptions like those we suffered in connection with the ransomware incident or the misappropriation of sensitive data and depending on their nature and scope could lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and exposure to liability such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions including reputational damage and legal claims or proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters

a significant number of our union employees are governed by cbas expired contracts are in the process of renegotiation and others expire within one year we may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts without work stoppages or labor difficulties or renegotiate them on favorable terms we have experienced work 

 

stoppages in the past and may experience them in the future if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected in addition our businesses rely on vendors suppliers and other third parties that have union employees strikes or work stoppages affecting these vendors suppliers and other third parties could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we operate in a challenging market for talent and may fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel including key personnel

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate train and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers the increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as workers with more tenure and experience retire the market for both hourly workers and professional workers was particularly challenging in fiscal 2021 the market for hourly workers was and remains very competitive in certain locations where we operate the demand for labor has exceeded the supply of labor resulting in higher costs despite our focused efforts to attract and retain employees including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances we experienced attrition rates within our hourly workforce in fiscal 2021 that exceeded historical levels and we incurred higher operating costs at certain of our facilities in the form of higher levels of overtime pay the market for professional workers was and remains similarly challenging many of our professional workers continue to work from home as part of our covid19 protocols and although in most instances we expect to offer flexible working arrangements in the future we may experience higher levels of attrition within our professional workforce in addition in september 2021 president biden issued an executive order directing the occupational safety and health administration to create rules requiring us employers with 100 or more employees to require covid19 vaccinations or weekly employee testing before coming to work osha issued the ets on november 5 2021 on november 12 2021 the us court of appeals for the fifth circuit issued an order staying enforcement and implementation of the ets implementation of these rules could cause us to experience additional challenges in retaining our employees we expect that the market for both hourly workers and professional workers will remain challenging at least through fiscal 2022 if we fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel or if we experience excessive turnover we may experience declining sales manufacturing delays or other operating inefficiencies increased recruiting training and relocation costs and other difficulties and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted

we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively the loss of these employees particularly during a challenging market for attracting and retaining employees could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted

we may be subject to physical operational and financial risks associated with climate change

our physical assets and infrastructure may be subject to risks from volatile and damaging weather patterns for example extreme weatherrelated events such as hurricanes tornados extreme storms wildfires and floods could result in physical damage to our facilities and lost production unpredictable weather patterns also may result in supply chain disruptions and increased material costs the ability to harvest the virgin fiber used in our manufacturing operations may be limited and prices for this raw material may fluctuate during prolonged periods of heavy rain or during tree disease or insect epidemics that may be caused by variations in climate conditions other climaterelated business risks that we face include risks related to the transition to a lowercarbon economy such as increased prices for certain fuels including natural gas the introduction of a carbon tax increased regulations and more stringent andor complex environmental and other permitting requirements to the extent that climaterelated risks materialize and we are unprepared for them we may incur unexpected costs which could have a material effect on our financial results of operations

 

financial risks

we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change

our businesses may be adversely affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control including but not limited to



for example we may experience lower demand for our products and the products of our customers that utilize our products if economic conditions in the us and globally including in europe brazil and mexico deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates lower family income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment or lower consumer spending in addition changes in trade policy including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs could impact demand for our products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments macroeconomic challenges may also lead to changes in tax laws or tax rates that may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities for example the biden administration has proposed significant changes to the us tax laws including an increase to the federal corporate tax rate limiting deductions where certain conditions exist and several proposals that would have the combined effect of increasing the us taxation on profits earned outside the us we are not able to predict with certainty economic and financial market conditions and social and political change and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected by adverse market conditions and social and political change

we have had significant levels of indebtedness in the past and may incur significant levels of indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business

at september 30 2021 we had 82 billion of debt outstanding compared to 94 billion at september 30 2020 the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences including



 

certain of our variable rate debt uses the london interbank offered rate “ libor ” as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate in march 2021 the uk financial conduct authority announced that all libor settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after december 31 2021 for sterling euro swiss franc and japanese yen settings and the oneweek and twomonth 

 

us dollar settings and immediately after june 30 2023 for the remaining us dollar settings in instances where we have not yet incorporated liborreplacement provisions into the credit agreements governing our variable rate debt that uses libor as an interest rate benchmark we will need to do so before june 30 2023 the discontinuation and replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation and replacement including that any benchmark replacement may not be the economic equivalent of libor or not achieve market acceptance similar to libor may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt 

we are subject to agreements that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants and may restrict us from among other things disposing of assets and incurring additional indebtedness these restrictions may limit our flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures

credit rating downgrades could increase our borrowing costs or otherwise adversely affect us

some of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from rating agencies our credit ratings could change based on among other things our results of operations and financial condition credit ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a “watch list” for a possible downgrade or assigned a “negative outlook” actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could increase our borrowing costs which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock if a downgrade were to occur or a negative outlook were to be assigned it could impact our ability to access the capital markets to raise debt andor increase the associated costs in addition while our credit ratings are important to us we may take actions and otherwise operate our business in a manner that adversely affects our credit ratings

we sell shortterm receivables from certain customer trade accounts on a revolving basis any downgrade of the credit rating or deterioration of the financial condition of these customers may make it more costly or difficult for us to engage in these activities which could adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity

we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a writedown would adversely impact our operating results and shareholders’ equity 

at september 30 2021 the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was 93 billion we review the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when impairment indicators exist the impairment test requires us to analyze a number of factors and make estimates that require judgment in fiscal 2021 our reporting units had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 each future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows changes in our business strategy and external market conditions among other factors could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net income if a significant write down were required the charge could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and shareholders’ equity and could impact the trading price of our common stock in fiscal 2020 we recorded a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of approximately 13 billion in our consumer packaging reporting unit

we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring

we have previously restructured portions of our operations and likely will engage in future restructuring initiatives because we are not able to predict with certainty market conditions including changes in the supply and demand for our products the loss of large customers the selling prices for our products or our manufacturing costs we may not be able to predict with certainty the appropriate time to undertake restructurings the cash and noncash costs associated with these activities vary depending on the type of facility impacted with the noncash cost of a mill closure generally being more significant than that of a converting facility due to the higher level of investment restructuring activities may divert the attention of management disrupt our operations and fail to achieve the intended cost and operations benefits

 

we may utilize our cash flow or incur additional indebtedness to increase our investment in gondi sa de cv “grupo gondi” or we may decrease our investment in grupo gondi 

in connection with our investment in the joint venture with grupo gondi we entered into an option agreement pursuant to which we and certain other shareholders of grupo gondi agreed to future put and call options with respect to the equity interests in the joint venture held by each party we own 323 of the joint venture pursuant to the option agreement our joint venture partners may call our 323 equity interest at a predetermined price between october 1 2021 and april 1 2022 at any time after april 1 2022 we may elect to sell and upon such election our joint venture partners will be obligated to buy all of our equity interest at a price as determined under the provisions of the agreement any arrangement pursuant to which we decrease our ownership in grupo gondi would reduce the geographical diversity of our business and may limit our growth opportunities in mexico any arrangement pursuant to which we increase our ownership in grupo gondi may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to satisfy our payment or investment obligations which may reduce the amount of funds available for our operations capital expenditures and corporate development activities or require us to incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities 

we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps

we participate in several mepps our contributions to any particular mepp may increase based on the declining funded status of a mepp and legal requirements such as those of the pension act which require substantially underfunded mepps to implement a funding improvement plan “ fip ” or a rehabilitation plan “ rp ” to improve their funded status the funded status of a mepp may be impacted by among other items a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans the inability or failure of companies withdrawing from the plan to pay their withdrawal liability low interest rates changes in actuarial assumptions andor lower than expected returns on pension fund assets

we believe that certain of the mepps in which we participate or have participated including piumpf have material unfunded vested benefits we submitted formal notification to withdraw from mepps in the past and have recorded withdrawal liabilities including an estimate of our portion of piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency we may withdraw from other mepps in the future at september 30 2021 we had 2471 million of withdrawal liabilities including liabilities associated with piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency demands in july 2021 piumpf filed suit against us in the us district court for the northern district of georgia claiming the right to recover our pro rata share of the pension fund’s accumulated funding deficiency the impact of increased contributions future funding obligations or future withdrawal liabilities may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

legal and regulatory risks

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign laws regulations and other requirements including those relating to the environment product safety competition corruption occupational health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax and health care these laws regulations and other requirements may change or be applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our equipment andor operations subject us to enforcement risk expose us to reputational harm or impose on or require us to incur additional costs including substantial compliance costs which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations our environmental expenditures include those related to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater including situations where we have been identified as a prp because environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving we will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance and our compliance costs could increase materially future compliance with existing and new laws and requirements has the potential to disrupt our business operations and may require significant expenditures and our existing reserves for specific matters may not be adequate to cover future costs in particular our manufacturing operations consume significant amounts of energy and we may in the future incur additional or increased capital operating and other expenditures from changes due to new or increased 

 

climaterelated and other environmental requirements we could also incur substantial liabilities including fines or sanctions enforcement actions natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury under environmental and common laws 

the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 and local antibribery laws including those in brazil china mexico india and the united kingdom where we maintain operations directly or through a joint venture prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of influencing official decisions our internal control policies and procedures or those of our vendors may not adequately protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed or alleged to have been committed by our employees agents or vendors any such violations could lead to civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties andor could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of labor and employment and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility additionally changing privacy laws in the united states where among others the california consumer privacy act became effective in 2020 and its successor the california privacy rights act which will be effective january 1 2023 europe where the general data protection regulation became effective in 2018 brazil where the lei geral de proteção de dados became effective in 2020 china where the personal information protection law became effective on november 1 2021 and elsewhere have created new individual privacy rights imposed increased obligations on companies handling personal data and increased potential exposure to fines and penalties

executive summary 

 

in fiscal 2021 we continued to pursue our strategy of offering differentiated sustainable paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win as a result of our broad portfolio 188 customers bought at least 1 million from each of our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments in fiscal 2021 net sales of 187461 million for fiscal 2021 increased 11673 million or 66 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher selling pricemix and higher volumes in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we experienced lost sales associated with the ransomware incident and winter weather events the “ events ” and we estimate these events decreased net sales by approximately 1891 million additionally we experienced aggregate favorable impact of foreign currency across our segments volumes in fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by covid19 primarily in the last half of the fiscal year 

 

segment income increased 2113 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher consumer packaging and corrugated packaging segment income a detailed review of our performance appears below under “ results of operations ”

 

we generated 22799 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to 20707 million in fiscal 2020 the increase was primarily due to a 1410 million net decrease in the use of working capital compared to the prior year period including the payment of certain fiscal 2020 bonuses and the company’s 401k match and annual company contribution ie up to 5 and 25 respectively in the form of stock rather than cash and deferral of certain payroll taxes in connection with the westrock pandemic action plan see “ covid19 response — westrock pandemic action plan ” for more information we invested 8155 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 while returning 2338 million in dividends to our stockholders and repurchasing 1224 million of common stock we believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest to sustain and improve our operating performance see “ liquidity and capital resources ” for more information 

earnings per diluted share was 313 in fiscal 2021 compared to loss per diluted share of 267 in fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings per diluted share were 339 and 275 in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the loss per diluted share in fiscal 2020 was driven by a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of 13332 million in our consumer packaging reporting unit 

a detailed review of our fiscal 2021 and 2020 performance appears below under “ results of operations ”

ransomware incident 

as previously disclosed on january 23 2021 we detected a ransomware incident impacting certain of our systems promptly upon our detection of this incident we initiated response and containment protocols and our security teams supplemented by leading cyber defense firms worked to remediate this incident these actions included taking preventative measures including shutting down certain systems out of an abundance of caution as well as taking steps to supplement existing security monitoring scanning and protective measures we notified law enforcement and contacted our customers to apprise them of the situation

we undertook extensive efforts to identify contain and recover from this incident quickly and securely our teams worked to maintain our business operations and minimize the impact on our customers and teammates in our second quarter form 10q we announced that all systems were back in service all of our mills and converting locations began producing and shipping paper and packaging at preransomware levels in march 2021 or earlier our mill system production was approximately 115000 tons lower than planned for the quarter ended march 31 2021 as a result of this incident while shipments from some of our facilities initially lagged behind production levels this gap closed as systems were restored during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 in locations where technology issues were identified we used alternative methods in many cases manual methods to process and ship orders we systematically brought our information systems back online in a controlled phased approach 

we estimate the pretax income impact of the lost sales and operational disruption of this incident on our operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was approximately 50 million as well as approximately 20 million of ransomware recovery costs primarily professional fees in addition we incurred approximately 9 million of ransomware recovery costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we recorded a 15 million credit for preliminary recoveries – approximately 10 million as a reduction of selling general and administrative expenses “ sga ” excluding intangible amortization and approximately 5 million as a reduction of 

 

cost of goods sold we expect to recover substantially all of the remaining ransomware losses from cyber and business interruption insurance in future periods disputes over the extent of insurance coverage for claims are not uncommon and there will be a time lag between the incurrence of costs and the receipt of any insurance proceeds 

in response to the ransomware event we accelerated information technology investments that we had previously planned to make in future periods in order to further strengthen our information security and technology infrastructure we engaged a leading cybersecurity defense firm that completed a forensics investigation of the ransomware incident and we are taking appropriate actions in response to the findings for example in the shortterm we reset all credentials companywide and strengthened security tooling across our servers and workstations longer term in collaboration with our strategic partners we established a roadmap to advance the maturity and effectiveness of our information security and resiliency capabilities this roadmap includes initiatives to further strengthen our information security posture across the company and to enable us to potentially detect respond to and recover from security and technical incidents in a faster and more effective manner more specifically we are progressing projects to bolster our security monitoring capabilities strengthen our access controls reduce risks associated with thirdparties and to enhance the information security of our mills and plants

see item 1a “ risk factors — we are subject to cybersecurity risks including related to customer employee vendor or other company data ” 

 

expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2022 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we expect a sequential decline in net sales and earnings from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 reflecting the normal season sequential volume declines in many of our businesses and scheduled mill maintenance outages we expect lower volume with three fewer shipping days during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 although in line with shipping days in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to delays in mill maintenance in fiscal 2021 for items such as covid19 and the ransomware incident we expect approximately 200000 tons of maintenance downtime the peak maintenance outage period for fiscal 2022 we expect sequential cost inflation driven primarily by higher natural gas transportation and recycled and virgin fiber costs along with increased health insurance costs prior to the annual reset of employee deductibles however we expect the flow through of the previously published price increases we are implementing to more than offset inflation 

 

in fiscal 2022 we expect solid demand across most of our end markets and continued flow through of the previously published price increases we expect record sales and operating profit despite continued commodity input cost inflation and productivity unavoidably affected by supply chain challenges and higher labor costs that may persist through the fiscal year we expect the implementation of previously published price increases will outpace inflation despite our expectation for higher recycled fiber energy virgin fiber chemical and transportation costs in addition we expect to benefit from the fiscal 2021 completion of strategic investments such as the new paper machine at our florence sc mill and our tres barras mill upgrade we expect our planned mill maintenance outage schedule will be approximately 100000 tons higher than in fiscal 2021

 

with the completion of certain of our strategic projects in fiscal 2021 including the paper machine at our florence sc mill and the tres barras mill upgrade project we expect capital expenditures of approximately 10 billion in fiscal 2022 

 

covid19 response 

 

westrock pandemic action plan 

 

given the uncertainties associated with the severity and duration of the pandemic in may 2020 we announced and began implementing the westrock pandemic action plan we are continuing to focus on the protection safety and wellbeing of our teammates and continuing to match our supply with our customers’ demand we have modified the westrock pandemic action plan as the impact of covid19 has evolved for example we changed our capital expenditure assumptions increased our may 2021 dividend and in october 2021 announced an 

 

incremental increase to our november 2021 dividend in each case as described below we expect that the actions that we have undertaken and will continue to undertake pursuant to the plan will provide an additional approximately 1 billion in cash through the end of calendar 2021 that we will be able to use to reduce our outstanding indebtedness in fiscal 2020 we achieved more than 350 million of the approximately 1 billion goal set forth in the westrock pandemic action plan as modified as of september 30 2021 we had achieved more than 975 million of the approximately 1 billion goal the ultimate level achieved has been impacted by modifications such as increased capital investments and increased dividends as we modified the westrock pandemic action plan 

 

pursuant to the westrock pandemic action plan we took a series of actions that were designed to protect the safety and wellbeing of our teammates and preserve cash that could be used to pay down our outstanding debt all while continuing to match our supply with our customers’ demand for example we committed to i reducing discretionary expenses ii using common stock to make company funded 401k match and annual contribution ie up to 5 and 25 respectively from july 1 2020 through september 30 2021 final period funded in october 2021 iii targeting a reduction of fiscal 2021 capital investments to a range of 800 million to 900 million up from an initial range of 600 to 800 million we invested 8155 million in fiscal 2021 and iv resetting our quarterly dividend to 020 per share for an annual rate of 080 per share which we did in may 2020 we paid quarterly dividends of 024 per share in may 2021 and august 2021 and in october 2021 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 025 per share representing a 100 per share annualized dividend or an increase of 25 since our february 2021 dividend the recent decisions to increase our dividend reflects the confidence we have in our business and our ability to generate strong cash flows as well as the progress we have made in reducing debt since we began implementing the westrock pandemic action plan 

 

in addition to the items addressed above we i decreased the salaries of our senior executive team by up to 25 from may 1 2020 through december 31 2020 and decreased the retainer for members of our board of directors by 25 for the third and fourth calendar quarters of 2020 ii used common stock to pay our annual incentive for fiscal 2020 for nearly all participants and set the payout level at 50 of the target opportunity subject to a safety modifier as well as for company funded 401k match and our annual contribution as noted above and iii postponed 1165 million of employment taxes incurred through the end of calendar year 2020 pursuant to relief offered under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security “ cares ” act we also reduced fiscal 2020 capital investments to 9781 million after targeting to reduce them by approximately 150 million to approximately 950 million we expect to pay the employment taxes deferred under the cares act as required 50 by december 2021 and the remaining 50 by december 2022

 

during fiscal 2021 we recorded 384 million of expense related to covid19 including 220 million of relief payments to employees in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 the balance was for increased costs for safety cleaning and other items related to covid19 during fiscal 2020 we provided onetime covid19 recognition awards to our teammates who work in manufacturing and operations and recognized expense of 316 million for those awards during fiscal 2020 we also incurred an additional expense of 324 million for cleaning safety supplies and equipment screening resources and other items we began tracking the impact of costs related to covid19 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we expect to continue to incur expenses for these items as needed in the future 

 

 

 

 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes our consolidated results for the two years ended september 30 2021

 



net sales unaffiliated customers 

net sales in fiscal 2021 increased 11673 million or 66 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher selling pricemix and higher volumes in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we experienced lost sales associated with the events that we estimate decreased net sales by approximately 1891 million additionally we experienced aggregate favorable impact of foreign currency across our segments volumes in fiscal 2020 were negatively impacted by covid19 primarily in the last half of the fiscal year  the change in net sales by segment is outlined below in “ results of operations — corrugated packaging segment ” and “ results of operations — consumer packaging segment ”

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold increased to 153158 million in fiscal 2021 compared to 143816 million in fiscal 2020 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 817 in fiscal 2021 compared to 818 in fiscal 2020 the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to higher volumes increased cost inflation and other items including operational disruption associated with the events these items were partially offset by productivity improvements and other items in fiscal 2020 we incurred approximately 45 million of direct costs and property damage associated with hurricane michael and received hurricane michaelrelated insurance proceeds of 323 million and recorded a reduction of cost of goods sold of 321 million in connection with an indirect tax claim in brazil primarily in the corrugated packaging segment the hurricane michaelrelated insurance proceeds were for 206 million of direct costs and property damage and for 117 million for business interruption recoveries in fiscal 2021 we recorded costs of goods sold of 354 million related to covid19 primarily for relief payments to employees and increased costs for safety cleaning and other items related to covid19 we began to track and report the impact of covid19 on fiscal 2020 in the third fiscal quarter fiscal 2020 includes costs of goods sold of 565 million associated with covid19 including onetime recognition awards to our teammates who work in manufacturing and operations recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 increased costs for safety cleaning and other items related to covid19 we expect to continue to 

 

incur additional costs related to safety cleaning and other items related to covid19 as needed in the foreseeable future we discuss these items in greater detail below in “ results of operations — corrugated packaging segment ” and “ results of operations — consumer packaging segment ”  

selling general and administrative excluding intangible amortization 

sga excluding intangible amortization increased 1349 million to 17593 million in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 1198 million increase in bonus and stockbased compensation expense as a result of expected fiscal 2021 payments being higher than fiscal 2020 payments including a 96 million acceleration of stockbased compensation in connection with the departure of our former chief executive officer in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 in addition we incurred increased aggregate costs for consulting professional and legal fees of 212 million compared to the prior year period primarily associated with the ransomware incident these increases were partially offset by a 294 million decrease in bad debt expense compared to the prior year period as well as a 184 million reduction in travel and entertainment associated with prolonged shelterinplace orders in response to the ongoing effects of covid19 sga excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of net sales increased in fiscal 2021 to 94 from 92 in fiscal 2020

selling general and administrative intangible amortization 

sga intangible amortization was 3571 million and 4005 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the decline was primarily attributable to certain intangibles from prior acquisitions reaching full amortization

restructuring and other costs 

we recorded aggregate pretax restructuring and other costs of 315 million and 1127 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively these amounts are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with each restructuring acquisition integration or divestiture vary we generally expect the integration of a closed facility’s assets and production with other facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility see “ note 4 restructuring and other costs ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including a description of the type of costs incurred we have restructured portions of our operations from time to time and it is likely that we will engage in additional restructuring opportunities in the future see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring ” 

goodwill impairment 

in fiscal 2020 we recorded a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of 13332 million in our consumer packaging reporting unit the impairment was driven by the expected lower volumes and cash flows related to certain external sbs end markets including commercial print tobacco and plate and cup stock markets  in fiscal 2021 no impairments were recorded as all reporting units that have goodwill have a fair value that exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 each

interest expense net was 3723 million and 3935 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the decrease was primarily due to lower debt levels in the current fiscal year that was partially offset by higher interest rates in the current fiscal year additionally fiscal 2020 was impacted by 205 million of interest income recorded in connection with an indirect tax claim in brazil partially offset by a 150 million increase in interest expense associated with the remeasurement of our multiemployer pension liabilities  see “ note 17 commitments and contingencies — indirect tax claim ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see item 1a “ risk factors — we have had significant levels of indebtedness in the past and may incur significant levels of indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ” 

pension and other postretirement nonservice income 

pension and other postretirement nonservice income was 1349 million and 1033 million in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively the increase was primarily due to the increase in plan asset balances used to determine the

equity in income of unconsolidated entities

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures mergers acquisitions and investments restructuring activities dividends and stock repurchases from net cash provided by operating activities borrowings 

 

under our credit facilities proceeds from our accounts receivable sales agreements proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment removed from service and proceeds received in connection with the issuance of debt and equity securities see “ note 13 debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our debt funding for our domestic operations in the foreseeable future is expected to come from sources of liquidity within our domestic operations including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facilities as such our foreign cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be a key source of liquidity to our domestic operations 

we are a party to enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties these obligations impact our shortterm and longterm liquidity and capital resource needs certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of september 30 2021 while others are considered future obligations our contractual obligations primarily consist of items such as longterm debt including current portion lease obligations purchase obligations and other obligations see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — contractual obligations”  for additional information 

cash and cash equivalents were 2909 million at september 30 2021 and 2511 million at september 30 2020 approximately threefourths of the cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2021 were held outside of the us the proportion of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us generally varies from period to period at september 30 2021 total debt was 81941 million 1688 million of which was current at september 30 2020 total debt was 94306 million 2229 million of which was current included in our total debt at september 30 2021 was 1924 million of noncash acquisition related stepup total debt was primarily impacted by net cash provided by operating activities exceeding aggregate capital expenditures dividends and stock repurchases

at september 30 2021 we had approximately 37 billion of availability under our longterm committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents our primary availability is under our revolving credit facilities and receivables securitization facility the majority of which matures on november 21 2024 this liquidity may be used to provide for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes including acquisitions dividends and stock repurchases on september 10 2021 we redeemed 400 million aggregate principal amount of our 4900 senior notes due march 2022 using cash and cash equivalents and recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of 86 million

certain restrictive covenants govern our maximum availability under our credit facilities we test and report our compliance with all of these covenants as required by these facilities and were in compliance with all of these covenants at september 30 2021

at september 30 2021 we had 632 million of outstanding letters of credit not drawn upon

 

we use a variety of working capital management strategies including supply chain financing  scf  programs vendor financing and commercial card programs monetization facilities where we sell shortterm receivables to thirdparty financial institutions and a receivables securitization facility we describe these programs below and in the notes to consolidated financial statements

we engage in certain customerbased scf programs to accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding accounts receivables from certain customers certain costs of these programs are borne by the customer or us receivables transferred under these customerbased supply chain finance programs generally meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with guidance under financial accounting standards board’s “ fasb ” accounting standards codification “ asc ” 860 “ transfers and servicing ” “ asc 860 ” resulting in derecognition of such receivables from our consolidated balance sheets receivables involved with these customerbased supply chain financing programs constitute approximately 2 of our annual net sales in addition we have monetization facilities that sell to thirdparty financial institutions all of the shortterm receivables generated from certain customer trade accounts for a discussion of our monetization facilities see “ note 12 fair value — ar sales agreements ”

our working capital management strategy includes working with our suppliers to revisit terms and conditions including the extension of payment terms our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers generally range from payable upon receipt to 120 days and vary for items such as the availability of cash discounts we do 

 

not believe our payment terms will be shortened significantly in the near future and we do not expect our net cash provided by operating activities to be significantly impacted by additional extensions of payment terms certain financial institutions offer voluntary scf programs that enable our suppliers at their sole discretion to sell their receivables from us to the financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers we and our suppliers agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure including prices quantities and payment terms regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in scf programs the suppliers sell us goods or services and issue the associated invoices to us based on the agreedupon contractual terms the due dates of the invoices are not extended due to the supplier’s participation in scf programs our suppliers at their sole discretion if they choose to participate in a scf program determine which invoices if any they want to sell to the financial institutions no guarantees are provided by us under scf programs and we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the scf program therefore amounts due to our suppliers that elect to participate in scf programs are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets and the activity is reflected in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on correspondence with the financial institutions that are involved with our two primary scf programs while the amount suppliers elect to sell to the financial institutions varies from period to period the amount generally averages approximately 15 of our accounts payable balance 

we also participate in certain vendor financing and commercial card programs to support our travel and entertainment expenses and smaller vendor purchases amounts outstanding under these programs are classified as debt primarily because we receive the benefit of extended payment terms and a rebate from the financial institution that we would not have otherwise received without the financial institutions’ involvement we also have a receivables securitization facility that allows for borrowing availability based on the eligible underlying accounts receivable and compliance with certain covenants for a discussion of our receivables securitization facility and the amount outstanding under our vendor financing and commercial card programs see “ note 13 debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

cash flow activity 

 



net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2021 increased 2092 million from fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher consolidated net income and a 1410 million net decrease in the use of working capital compared to the prior year 

net cash used for investing activities of 6760 million in fiscal 2021 consisted primarily of 8155 million for capital expenditures that were partially offset by 585 million of proceeds from the sale of the summerville sc sawmill 449 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance and 295 million of proceeds from the sale of investments net cash used for investing activities of 9215 million in fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of 9781 million for capital expenditures that were partially offset by 350 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment and 169 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance 

we invested 8155 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 which is in the range of the 800 million to 900 million we expected to invest heading into the year with the completion of certain of our strategic projects in fiscal 2021 including the paper machine at our florence sc mill and the tres barras mill upgrade project we expect capital expenditures of approximately 10 billion in fiscal 2022 at this level of capital investment we are confident that we will continue to invest in the appropriate safety environmental and maintenance projects while also making investments to support productivity and growth in our business however it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions may change project completion dates may change or we may decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify or changes in market conditions or to comply with environmental or other regulatory changes

 

in fiscal 2021 net cash used for financing activities of 15804 million consisted primarily of a net decrease in debt of 12413 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders of 2338 million and stock repurchases of 1224 million in fiscal 2020 net cash used for financing activities of 10211 million consisted primarily of a net decrease in debt of 6739 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders of 3445 million 

we estimate that we will invest approximately 21 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance we were obligated to purchase approximately 249 million of fixed assets at september 30 2021 for various capital projects see item 1a “ risk factors — our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated ” 

at september 30 2021 the us federal state and foreign net operating losses and other us federal and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately 59 million in future potential reductions of us federal state and foreign cash taxes based on our current projections we expect to utilize nearly all of the remaining us federal net operating losses and other us federal credits during the current fiscal year foreign and state net operating losses and credits will be used over a longer period of time our cash tax rate is highly dependent on our taxable income utilization of net operating losses and credits changes in tax laws or tax rates capital expenditures and other factors barring significant changes in our current assumptions including changes in tax laws or tax rates forecasted taxable income levels of capital expenditures and other items we expect our fiscal 2022 cash tax rate will be slightly lower than our income tax rate our cash tax rate in fiscal 2023 and 2024 will be driven slightly higher than our income tax rate primarily due to the absence of certain nonrecurring tax credits the expected release of a tax reserve and the reduction in capital investments including the timing of depreciation on our qualifying capital investments as allowed under the tax cuts and jobs act

during fiscal 2021 and 2020 we made contributions of 232 million and 225 million respectively to our us and nonus pension plans based on current facts and assumptions we expect to contribute approximately 25 million to our us and nonus pension plans in fiscal 2022 based on current assumptions including future interest rates we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our us and nonus pension plans will be approximately 23 million to 24 million annually in fiscal 2023 through 2026 we have made contributions and expect to continue to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the pension act and other regulations the net overfunded status of our us and nonus pension plans at september 30 2021 was 4051 million see “ note 5 retirement plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the normal course of business we evaluate our potential exposure to mepps including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from piumpf and central states southeast and southwest areas pension plan “ central states ” and recorded estimated withdrawal liabilities for each we also have liabilities associated with other mepps that we or legacy companies have withdrawn from in the past currently we pay approximately 14 million a year in withdrawal liabilities excluding accumulated funding deficiency demands with respect to certain other mepps in the event we withdraw from one or more of the mepps in the future it is reasonably possible that we may incur withdrawal liabilities in connection with such withdrawals our estimate of any such withdrawal liability both individually and in the aggregate is not material for the remaining plans in which we participate at september 30 2021 and september 30 2020 we had withdrawal liabilities recorded of 2471 million and 2520 million respectively including liabilities associated with piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency demands see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps ” 

in october 2021 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 025 per share representing a 100 per share annualized dividend or an increase of 25 since our february 2021 dividend the recent decisions to increase our dividend reflects the confidence we have in our business and our ability to generate strong cash flows as well as the progress we have made in reducing debt since we began implementing the westrock pandemic action plan in fiscal 2021 we paid an annual dividend of 088 per share we paid a quarterly dividend of 024 024 020 and 020 per share in august 2021 may 2021 february 2021 and november 2020 respectively compared to 133 per share in fiscal 2020 we paid a quarterly dividend of 020 020 0465 and 0465 per share in august 2020 may 2020 february 2020 and november 2019 respectively and 182 per share in fiscal 2019 in may 2020 we reduced our dividend given the uncertain market conditions at the time driven by covid19 we believe the reduction was prudent given the uncertain market conditions at the time and the reduction has allowed us to allocate additional cash to pay down our outstanding debt our shortterm goal has 

 

been to reduce debt and leverage and return capital to stockholders through a competitive annual dividend longer term our capital allocation priorities include i investing in our business ii consistently growing our dividend iii maintaining our investment grade profile iv pursue tuckin acquisitions that align to our strategy and generate attractive returns and v opportunistic share repurchases 

in july 2015 our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 400 million shares of our common stock representing approximately 15 of our outstanding common stock as of july 1 2015 shares of our common stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions the timing manner price and amount of repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on factors including the market price of our common stock general economic and market conditions and applicable legal requirements the repurchase program may be commenced suspended or discontinued at any time in fiscal 2021 we repurchased approximately 25 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 1251 million a portion of which settled after september 30 2021 in fiscal 2020 we repurchased no shares of our common stock in fiscal 2019 we repurchased approximately 21 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 886 million as of september 30 2021 we had approximately 166 million shares of common stock available for repurchase under the program

we anticipate that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures interest payments dividends and stock repurchases pension payments working capital needs note repurchases restructuring activities repayments of current portion of longterm debt and other corporate actions for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from our accounts receivable sales agreements proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities or other additional longterm debt financing including new or amended facilities in addition we continually review our capital structure and conditions in the private and public debt markets in order to optimize our mix of indebtedness in connection with these reviews we may seek to refinance existing indebtedness to extend maturities reduce borrowing costs or otherwise improve the terms and composition of our indebtedness

contractual obligations 

we summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at september 30 2021 and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table certain amounts in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans because these estimates and assumptions are subjective the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those presented in the table

each series of notes and the related guarantees constitute unsecured unsubordinated obligations of the applicable obligor each series of notes and the related guarantees ranks equally in right of payment with all of the applicable obligor’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt ranks senior in right of payment to all of the applicable obligor’s existing and future subordinated debt is effectively junior to the applicable obligor’s existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and is structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities of each subsidiary of the applicable obligor that is not itself an obligor that does not guarantee such notes 

the indentures governing each series of notes contain covenants that among other things limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to grant liens on our assets and enter into sale and leaseback transactions in addition the indentures limit as applicable the ability of the issuer and guarantors to merge consolidate or sell convey transfer or lease our or their properties and assets substantially as an entirety the covenants contained in the indentures do not restrict the company’s ability to pay dividends or distributions to stockholders

the guarantee obligations of the guarantors under the notes are also subject to certain limitations and terms similar to those applicable to other guarantees of similar instruments including that i the guarantees are subject to fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws and ii the obligations of each guarantor under its guarantee of each series of notes will be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the obligations of such guarantor under its guarantee of such notes not to be deemed to constitute a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law

nongaap financial measures 

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “ gaap ” however management believes certain nongaap financial measures provide our board of directors investors potential investors securities analysts and others with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance management also uses these nongaap financial measures in making financial operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our gaap results the nongaap financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies

we use the nongaap financial measures “adjusted net income” and “adjusted earnings per diluted share” management believes these measures provide our board of directors investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because they exclude restructuring and other costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business we and our board of directors use this information to evaluate our performance relative to other periods we believe that the most directly comparable gaap measures to adjusted net income and adjusted 

 

earnings per diluted share are net income loss attributable to common stockholders and earnings loss per diluted share respectively 

set forth below is a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure adjusted earnings per diluted share to earnings loss per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measure in dollars per share for the periods indicated

 



 

 

 

 

the gaap results in the tables below for pretax tax and net of tax are equivalent to the line items “income loss before income taxes” “income tax expense” and “consolidated net income loss” respectively as reported on the consolidated statements of operations set forth below are reconciliations of adjusted net income to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income loss attributable to common stockholders represented in the table below as the gaap results for consolidated net income loss ie net of tax less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the periods indicated in millions

 



 

 

 

we discuss certain of these charges in more detail in “ note 4 restructuring and other costs ” “ note 7 segment information ” and “ note 17 commitments and contingencies — indirect tax claim ”

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates

we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities reported certain significant accounting policies are described in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

these critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management’s most subjective and complex judgments the accounting for these 

 

matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts circumstances and assumptions that in management’s judgment could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and accordingly could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates 

goodwill

we review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value as set forth in asc 350 “intangibles — goodwill and other” we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component

asc 350 allows an optional qualitative assessment prior to a quantitative assessment test to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we generally do not attempt a qualitative assessment and move directly to the quantitative test as part of the quantitative test we utilize the present value of expected cash flows or as appropriate a combination of the present value of expected cash flows and the guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units this present value model requires management to estimate future cash flows the timing of these cash flows and a discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions that the reporting units use for internal planning purposes which we believe would be generally consistent with that of a market participant if we determine that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if we determine that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value we measure the goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value as required under asu 201704  “ simplifying the test for goodwill impairment ” which we early adopted starting with our fiscal 2020 annual goodwill impairment test on july 1 2020 we describe our accounting policy for goodwill further in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — goodwill and longlived assets ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing we considered factors such as but not limited to our expectations for the shortterm and longterm impacts of covid19 macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations and financial performance including planned revenue earnings and capital investments of each reporting unit the discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 80 to 120 we used perpetual growth rates in the reporting units ranging from 05 to 10 all reporting units that have goodwill were noted to have a fair value that exceeded their carrying values by more than 20 each if we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis points to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value

at september 30 2021 the north american corrugated consumer packaging brazil corrugated and victory packaging reporting units had 35185 million 22959 million 1037 million and 411 million of goodwill respectively our longlived assets including intangible assets remain recoverable subsequent to our annual test we monitored industry economic trends until the end of our fiscal year and determined no additional testing for goodwill impairment was warranted we have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years currently we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses however we cannot predict certain market factors with certainty including the impact of covid19 and have certain risks inherent to our operations as described in item 1a “ risk factors ”  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material

see item 1a “ risk factors — we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a writedown would adversely impact our operating results and shareholders’ equity ”  

longlived assets

we follow the provisions included in asc 360 “property plant and equipment” in determining whether the carrying value of any of our longlived assets including rightofuse assets “ rou ” and amortizing intangibles 

 

other than goodwill is impaired we review longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the longlived asset might not be recoverable if we determine that indicators of impairment are present we determine whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows for the potentially impaired assets are less than the carrying value this requires management to estimate future cash flows through operations over the remaining useful life of the asset and its ultimate disposition the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions we use for internal planning purposes updated to reflect current expectations if our estimated undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the asset and record an impairment charge if the carrying value is greater than the fair value of the asset we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows observable prices for similar assets or other valuation techniques 

our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors market conditions and operational performance future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired evaluating impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows which also require judgment by management 

accounting for income taxes

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances if any we use significant judgment in i determining whether a tax position based solely on its technical merits is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination and ii measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is “more likely than not” to be realized upon ultimate settlement we do not record any benefit for the tax positions where we do not meet the “more likely than not” initial recognition threshold income tax positions must meet a “more likely than not” recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized we generally recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations resolution of the uncertain tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or materially benefit our results of operations in future periods depending upon their ultimate resolution a 1 change in our effective tax rate would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately 109 million for fiscal 2021 a 1 change in our effective tax rate used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets as recorded on the september 30 2021 consolidated balance sheet would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately 124 million for fiscal 2021

pension

the funded status of our qualified and nonqualified us and nonus pension plans increased 3534 million in fiscal 2021 our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans were over funded by 3879 million as of september 30 2021 our nonus pension plans were over funded by 172 million as of september 30 2021 our us pension plan benefit obligations were negatively impacted in fiscal 2021 primarily by a 1basis point decrease in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date the nonus pension plan obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2021 by a 47basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date

the determination of pension obligations and pension expense requires various assumptions that can significantly affect liability and expense amounts such as the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets discount rates projected future compensation increases and mortality rates for each of our plans these assumptions are determined annually in conjunction with our actuary the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts circumstances and assumptions that in management’s judgment could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and accordingly could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates

 

a 25basis point change in the discount rate compensation level expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and interest crediting rate factoring in our corridor as defined herein as appropriate would have had the following effect on fiscal 2021 pension expense amounts in the table in parentheses reflect additional income in millions

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk from changes in among other things interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices we aim to identify and understand these risks and then implement strategies to manage them when evaluating these strategies we evaluate the fundamentals of each market our sensitivity to movements in pricing and underlying accounting and business implications our chief executive officer and chief financial officer must approve the execution of all transactions contemplated in accordance with our financial and commodity risk management corporate policy the sensitivity analyses we present below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes we may not be successful in managing these risks

containerboard and paperboard shipments

we are exposed to market risk related to our sales of containerboard and paperboard we sell a significant portion of our mill production and converted products pursuant to contracts that provide that prices are either fixed for specified terms or provide for price adjustments based on negotiated terms including changes in specified index prices we have the capacity to annually ship approximately 121 million tons in our corrugated packaging segment and approximately 41 million tons in our consumer packaging segment although our mill system operating rates may vary from year to year due to changes in market and other factors our simple average mill system operating rates for the last three years averaged 91 a hypothetical 10 per ton change in the price of containerboard and paperboard throughout the year based on our capacity would impact our sales by approximately 121 million and 41 million in our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments respectively see item 1a “ risk factors — our earnings are highly dependent on volumes ” 

energy

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas coal oil electricity diesel and wood byproducts biomass at times have fluctuated significantly in our recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and at a few mills to generate electricity used on site in our virgin fiber mills we use biomass natural gas and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates we may from time to time use commodity contracts to hedge energy exposures

we spent approximately 903 million and 773 million on all energy sources in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively to operate our facilities the increase in energy costs in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to inflation natural gas and electricity each account for approximately 30 to 40 of our energy purchases depending upon 

 

pricing while the amount of energy we consume may vary from year to year due to production levels and other factors in fiscal 2022 we expect to consume approximately 90 million mmbtu of natural gas a hypothetical 10 change in the price of energy throughout the year would impact our cost of energy by approximately 90 million based on fiscal 2021 pricing and consumption 

recycled fiber

recycled fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of recycled paperboard and a portion of our containerboard in fiscal 2021 and 2020 we consumed approximately 58 million and 55 million tons of recycled fiber respectively recycled fiber prices can fluctuate significantly our purchases of old corrugated containers and doublelined kraft clippings accounted for our largest recycled fiber costs and approximately 85 to 90 of our recycled fiber purchases the remaining 10 to 15 of our recycled fiber purchases consisted of a number of other grades of recycled paper the mix of recycled fiber may vary due to factors such as market demand availability and pricing recycled fiber prices increased in fiscal 2021 from prior year levels while the amount of recycled fiber we consume may vary from year to year due to production levels and other factors in fiscal 2022 we expect to consume approximately 59 million tons of recycled fiber a hypothetical 10 change in recycled fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would impact our costs by approximately 59 million

virgin fiber

virgin fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of a portion of our containerboard bleached paperboard and market pulp while virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices they also fluctuate particularly due to significant changes in weather such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations virgin fiber prices increased modestly in fiscal 2021 from prior year levels a hypothetical 10 change in virgin fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would impact our costs by approximately 138 million

freight

inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us factors that influence our freight expense are items such as distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs primarily diesel freight costs increased in fiscal 2021 following a decline in freight costs in fiscal 2020 primarily due to inflation and supply constraints a hypothetical 10 change in freight costs for fiscal 2021 and 2020 would impact our costs by approximately 190 million and 161 million respectively in fiscal 2022 we expect to consume approximately 83 million gallons of diesel see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

interest rates

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our shortterm and longterm debt as discussed below we may from time to time use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at september 30 2021 and 2020 including the impact of our interest rate swaps if market interest rates change an average of 100 basis points our annual interest expense would be impacted by approximately 11 million and 13 million respectively we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs this analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment see item 1a “ risk factors — we have had significant levels of indebtedness in the past and may incur significant levels of indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ” 

derivative instruments  forward contracts

we periodically may issue and settle foreign currency denominated debt exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates on open balances at each balance sheet date from time to time we may use foreign exchange contracts to hedge these exposures with terms of generally one month based on our open foreign exchange contracts as of september 30 2021 and 2020 the effect of a 1 change in exchange rates would impact other income net by 

 

approximately 3 million for each year although these foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the foreign currency denominated debt exposures the fluctuation of these instruments may cause future cash settlement of the hedge 

we periodically may also enter into interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our outstanding debt but currently have no active interest rate swaps or commodity forward contracts interest rate swaps are either designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of forecasted floating interest payments on variable rate debt or fair value hedges of fixed rate debt or we may elect not to treat them as accounting hedges we may enter into swaps or forward contracts on certain commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases or sales of those commodities 

pension plans

our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment among other factors adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities during fiscal 2021 and 2020 the effect of a 025 decrease in the discount rate would have reduced pretax income by approximately 15 million and 13 million respectively and a 025 increase in the discount rate would have increased pretax income by 15 million and 15 million respectively similarly mepps in which we participate could experience similar circumstances which could impact our funding requirements and therefore expenses see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps ” 

foreign currency

we predominately operate in markets in the us but derived 185 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers although we are impacted by the exchange rates of a number of currencies our largest exposures are generally to the brazilian real british pound canadian dollar euro and mexican peso in conducting our foreign operations we also make intercompany sales and receive royalties and dividends denominated in different currencies these activities expose us to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates flows of foreign currencies into and out of our operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements 

at times certain of our foreign subsidiaries have us dollardenominated external debt in these instances we may hedge the nonfunctional currency exposure with derivatives we issue intercompany loans to and receive foreign cash deposits from our foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates from deposits from time to time we may use foreignexchange hedge contracts with terms of generally less than one year to hedge these exposures although our derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the matched exposures

during fiscal 2021 and 2020 the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies that we have exposure to compared to the us dollar would have impacted our segment results by approximately 40 million and 30 million respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

during fiscal 2021 and 2020 the effect of a hypothetical 1 change in exchange rates would have impacted accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately 30 million and 21 million respectively this impact does not consider the effects of a stronger or weaker us dollar on our ability to compete for export business or the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment changes in foreign exchange rates could impact the price and the demand for our products such as a strengthening us dollar causes exports to become more expensive to foreign customers and business that have to pay for them in other currencies see item 1a “ risk factors — we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ”

we are one of the largest manufacturers of folding cartons in north america we believe we are the largest manufacturer of solid fiber partitions in north america measured by net sales our folding cartons are used to package items such as food paper beverages dairy products tobacco confectionery health and beauty and other household consumer commercial and industrial products primarily for retail sale our folding cartons are also used by our customers to attract consumer attention at the pointofsale we manufacture express mail packages for the overnight courier industry provide inserts and labels as well as rigid packaging and other printed packaging products such as transaction cards eg credit debit etc brochures product literature marketing materials such as booklets folders inserts cover sheets and slipcases and grower tags and plant stakes for the horticultural market for the global healthcare market we manufacture paperboard packaging for overthecounter and prescription drugs our customers generally use our inserts and labels to provide customer product information either inside a secondary package eg a folding carton or affixed to the outside of a primary package eg a bottle folding cartons typically protect customers’ products during shipment and distribution and employ graphics to promote them at retail we manufacture folding cartons from recycled and virgin paperboard laminated paperboard and various substrates with specialty characteristics such as grease masking and microwaveability we print coat diecut and glue the cartons to customer specifications and ship finished cartons to customers for assembling filling and sealing we employ a broad range of offset flexographic gravure backside printing coating and finishing technologies as well as iridescent holographic textured and dimensional effects to provide differentiated packaging products and support our customers with new package development innovation and design services and package testing services we manufacture and sell our solid fiber and corrugated partitions and diecut paperboard components principally to glass container manufacturers producers of beer food wine spirits cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and the automotive industry 

sales of consumer packaging products to external customers accounted for 353 357 and 401 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information

land and development segment

during fiscal 2020 we completed the monetization of the various real estate holdings that we owned that were concentrated in the charleston sc region sales in our land and development segment to external customers accounted for 01 01 and 09 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” for additional information we completed the monetization of our assets in the land and development segment during fiscal 2020 therefore this segment no longer exists

seasonality

while our businesses are not materially impacted by seasonality there is some variability in demand that occurs from quarter to quarter with net sales in the first quarter of each fiscal year typically being the lowest as such we disclose net sales segment income and shipment data by segment by quarter in item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” generally we expect more of our earnings and cash flows to be generated in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half of the fiscal year due to these variations and other factors including the timing of scheduled mill maintenance outages

raw materials

the primary raw materials used by our mill operations are recycled fiber at our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills and virgin fiber from hardwoods and softwoods at our virgin containerboard and paperboard mills certain of our virgin containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate significantly while virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices they also fluctuate particularly due to significant changes in weather such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations

containerboard and paperboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations our converting operations use many different grades of containerboard and paperboard we supply substantially all of our converting operations needs for containerboard and paperboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps with other manufacturers these arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs because there are other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of containerboard and paperboard used in our converting operations we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from 

 

other suppliers in the event that we incur production disruptions for recycled or virgin containerboard and paperboard see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ”  

energy

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas coal oil electricity and wood byproducts biomass at times has fluctuated significantly in our recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and at a few mills to generate electricity used on site in our virgin fiber mills we use natural gas biomass and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates see item 1 “ business — governmental regulation — environmental ” for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ”  see also item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — “energy” and “derivative instruments  forward contracts” for additional information regarding our energy consumption

transportation

inbound and outbound freight is a significant cost for us factors that influence our freight expense are distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from our facilities to our customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs while we experienced higher freight costs in fiscal 2019 freight costs declined in fiscal 2020 the principal markets for our products are in north america south america europe asia and australia see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

sales and marketing

none of our external customers individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2020 we generally manufacture our products pursuant to our customers’ orders we believe that we have good relationships with our customers see item 1a “ risk factors — we depend on certain large customers ” 

as a result of our vertical integration our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products during fiscal 2020 approximately twothirds of our coated natural kraft tons shipped approximately threefifths of our coated recycled paperboard tons shipped and approximately onefifth of our bleached paperboard tons shipped were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture folding cartons and approximately threefourths of our containerboard tons shipped including trade swaps and buysell transactions were delivered to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products under the terms of our seven hills joint venture arrangement our joint venture partner is required to purchase all of the qualifying gypsum paperboard liner produced by seven hills excluding the production from seven hills and from our aurora il mill which is converted into book covers and other products approximately onethird of our specialty recycled paperboard tons shipped in fiscal 2020 were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture interior partitions we have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our operations

as a result of our broad portfolio of differentiated and sustainable paper and packaging solutions we serve more than 15000 customers including 160 customers who buy at least 1 million from both our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments we believe that our ability to leverage our full portfolio of differentiated solutions and capabilities enables us to set ourselves apart from our competitors

we market our products primarily through our own sales force we also market a number of our products through independent sales representatives and independent distributors we generally pay our sales personnel a combination of base salary commissions and annual bonus we pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis orders from our customers generally do not have significant lead times we discuss foreign net sales to unaffiliated customers and other nonus operations’ financial and other segment information in “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 

competition 

we operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large well established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions including industry capacity changes global competition economic conditions in the us and abroad as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates

the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and no single company dominates any of those industries our containerboard and paperboard operations compete with integrated and nonintegrated national and regional companies operating primarily in north america and to a limited extent manufacturers outside of north america our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies in the corrugated packaging and folding carton markets we compete with a significant number of national regional and local packaging suppliers in north america and abroad in the solid fiber interior packaging promotional pointofpurchase display and converted paperboard products markets we primarily compete with a smaller number of national regional and local companies offering highly specialized products 

since all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly discuss sales opportunities for new business or for renewal of existing business with customers our packaging products compete with packaging made from other materials including plastics the primary competitive factors we face include price design product innovation quality service and sustainability with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences our machinery solutions represent one example of how we compete by providing differentiated solutions that create value for our customers we believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and we obtain feedback on our performance with periodic customer surveys among other means

the industries in which we operate have undergone consolidation within the packaging products industry larger customers with an expanded geographic presence have tended to seek suppliers that can because of their broad geographic presence efficiently and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs in addition our customers continue to demand higher quality products meeting stricter quality control requirements increasing demand for more sustainable products is also impacting our industry see item 1 “ business — sustainability ” for additional information

see item 1a “ risk factors — we face intense competition ” and “risk factors — we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ” 

governmental regulation

health and safety

our business involves the use of heavy equipment machinery and chemicals and requires the performance of activities that create safety exposures the health and safety of our teammates is our first priority and we have established safety policies programs procedures and training for our manufacturing operations we are subject to a broad range of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety and our safety program includes measures required for compliance in addition our program includes the ongoing identification and elimination of workplace exposures that can lead to injuries and sharing of health and safety best practices

certain governmental authorities in locations where we do business have established asbestos standards for the workplace although we do not use asbestos in manufacturing our products asbestos containing material “ acm ” is present in some of the facilities we lease or own for those facilities where acm is present and acm is subject to regulation we have established procedures for properly managing it 

we do not believe that future compliance with occupational health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 

environmental 

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ manufacturing processes that involve discharges to water air emissions water intake and waste handling activities these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various governmental authorities complex and lengthy processes may be required to obtain and renew approvals permits and licenses for new existing or modified facilities additionally the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency response procedures our integrated chemical pulping mills in the us and brazil are subject to more stringent environmental programs and regulations but all of our manufacturing facilities have environmental compliance obligations

on january 31 2013 the us environmental protection agency the “ epa ” published a set of four interrelated final rules establishing national air emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants from industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters commonly known as “ boiler mact ” the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact on july 29 2016 vacating key portions of the rule including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers and sending it back to the epa for further rulemaking on august 24 2020  a proposed epa rule to amend boiler mact was published in the federal register in response to issues raised in multiple court decisions concerning the rule the epa’s proposal would change several numeric emission limits for new and existing boilers and process heaters including new fluidized bed boilers and existing coalfired boilers like those at several westrock paper mills based on our evaluation of the proposed rule emissions data and testing we do not believe that the capital or operating costs for us to comply with the proposed boiler mact limits will be material however we are continuing to track the development of the proposed rule and its potential impacts on us we anticipate that we will have up to three years after the effective date of the final rule to demonstrate compliance with the new boiler mact limits

in addition to boiler mact we are subject to several other federal state local and international environmental rules that may impact our business including other maximum achievable control technology standards national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide fine particulate matter and ozone for facilities and national pollutant discharge elimination system permitting requirements in the us legal requirements to review and revise existing environmental regulations applicable to our business as well as litigation challenging these regulations could result in more stringent or additional compliance obligations that may require capital investments or increase our operating costs

we are involved in various administrative and other proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business and we may become involved in similar matters in the future although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information we do not believe that the currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

we face potential liability under federal state local and international laws as a result of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment from various sites owned and operated by third parties at which companygenerated wastes have allegedly been deposited generators of hazardous substances sent to offsite disposal locations at which environmental problems exist as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are liable for response costs for the investigation and remediation of such sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “ cercla ” and analogous laws while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla liability is typically shared with other potentially responsible parties “ prps ” and costs are commonly allocated according to relative amounts of waste deposited and other factors

in addition certain of our current or former locations are being investigated or remediated under various environmental laws including cercla based on information known to us and assumptions we do not believe that the costs of these investigation and remediation projects will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows however the discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations including natural resources damages at these or other sites in the future could result in additional costs

 

we believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under purchase and other agreements in connection with certain remediation sites in addition we believe that we have insurance coverage subject to applicable deductibles or retentions policy limits and other conditions for certain environmental matters however there can be no assurance that we will be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights or that if we are successful any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights will be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses we also cannot predict with certainty whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at other locations and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed current reserves in addition we cannot currently assess with certainty the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or federal state or other environmental laws regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

see item 1a “ risk factors — we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs ” 

we estimate that we will invest approximately 27 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2021 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions and the project completion dates may change and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects and changes in environmental laws and regulations

climate change

some of our paper mills our most energyintensive manufacturing facilities burn renewable biomass to generate more than 60 percent of their energy needs based on overall fuel mix most of these facilities also selfgenerate the steam and power needed for their manufacturing processes using combined heat and power or “cogeneration” systems our recycling operations help to divert approximately 8 million tons of paper and packaging from landfills where it would otherwise degrade and release greenhouse gases in the form of methane which has a high global warming potential our fiber procurement activities create economic incentives for landowners and family tree farmers to maintain their holdings as working forests that sequester carbon and provide many other environmental benefits including protection for fresh water supplies and habitats for diverse species of plants and animals 

 

in 2015 the company established a goal to reduce its scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions per ton of production by 20 from a 2015 baseline by 2020 as of september 30 2019 we achieved a 15 reduction of greenhouse gas “ ghg ” per ton of production and an absolute reduction of 21 from our baseline we have accomplished these reductions primarily by displacing coal with natural gas and investing in new biomass boilers at our covington va and demopolis al mills our strategy for achieving our existing target includes continued investments in natural gas projects and infrastructure as well as implementation of measures to improve the energy efficiency of our manufacturing operations responsibility for tracking performance against our ghg target is led by our sustainability group which reports to our chief innovation officer and the data is verified by our internal audit department 

 

climate change presents opportunities for our business for example we produce renewable energy in abundant amounts and generates renewable energy credits “ recs ” an entity seeking to reduce its greenhouse gas profile can purchase our recs and receive the rights to the environmental attributes of the renewable electricity generated by our integrated kraft paper mills the recs we generate are flexible marketbased tools that support the renewable energy market and advance climaterelated sustainability initiatives our recycling activities also may present the opportunity to generate offsets that could be used to meet climaterelated obligations for ourselves or others

 

climate change also presents potential risks and uncertainties for us with respect to physical climate risks our manufacturing operations may be impacted by weatherrelated events such as hurricanes and floods potentially resulting in lost production supply chain disruptions and increased material costs unpredictable weather patterns also may impact virgin fiber prices which may fluctuate during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought on the other hand changes in climate also could result in more accommodating weather patterns for greater periods of time in certain areas which may create favorable fiber market conditions we incorporate a review of meteorological forecast data into our fiber procurement decisions and strategies to the extent that 

 

climaterelated risks materialize and we are unprepared for them we may incur unexpected costs which could have a material effect on our financial results of operations 

responses to climate change may result in regulatory risks as new laws and regulations aimed at mandating ghg reductions come into effect these rules and regulations could take the form of capandtrade carbon taxes or ghg reductions mandates for utilities that could increase the cost of purchased electricity new climate rules and regulations also may result in higher fossil fuel prices or fuel efficiency standards that could increase transportation costs certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have already taken actions to address climate change in the us the epa has issued the clean air act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit ghg the epa also has promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to file an annual report of their emissions while we have facilities subject to existing ghg permitting and reporting requirements the impact of these requirements has not been material to date

in addition to these national efforts some us states in which we have manufacturing operations including washington new york and virginia are taking measures to reduce ghg emissions such as requiring ghg emissions reporting or developing regional capandtrade programs in addition several of our international facilities are located in countries that have already adopted ghg emissions trading schemes for example quebec has become a member of the western climate initiative which is a collaboration among california and certain canadian provinces that have joined together to create a capandtrade program to reduce ghg emissions in 2009 quebec adopted a target of reducing ghg emissions by 20 below 1990 levels by 2020 and 375 from 1990 levels by 2030 in 2011 quebec issued a final regulation establishing a regional capandtrade program that required reductions in ghg emissions from covered emitters as of january 1 2013 our mill in quebec is subject to these capandtrade requirements although the direct impact of this regulation has not been material to date other countries in which we conduct business including china european union member states and india have set ghg reduction targets in accordance with the agreement signed in april 2016 among over 170 countries that established a framework for reducing global ghg emissions also known as the “ paris agreement ” which became effective in november 2016

regulation related to climate change continues to develop in the areas of the world where we conduct business we have systems in place for tracking the ghg emissions from our energyintensive facilities and we carefully monitor developments in climate related laws regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and disclosure obligations compliance with climate programs may require future expenditures to meet ghg emission reduction obligations in future years these obligations may include carbon taxes the requirement to purchase ghg credits or the need to acquire carbon offsets also we may be required to make capital and other investments to displace traditional fossil fuels such as fuel oil and coal with lower carbon alternatives such as biomass and natural gas 

sustainability

 

at westrock we say sustainability is in every fiber of our company in truth it forms an integral part of our busines plan where our goal is to embed sustainability into our culture and strategy to innovate create value and build competitive advantage our vision imagining and delivering on the promise of a sustainable future  is represented by three pillars







we deliver our fiberbased packaging solutions by way of our core purpose connecting people to products® through safe and sustainable packaging paperbased packaging has many attributes that make it wellsuited to helping our customers deliver more sustainable solutions to their customers it is lightweight durable versatile made with renewable materials and in many instances recyclable or compostable we believe that our size and scale coupled with our history of developing innovative products and solutions uniquely positions us to help our customers meet or exceed their sustainability objectives 

we are one of the largest recyclers in the paper industry we recover 8 million tons annually of paper cardboard and other materials representing waste that would otherwise go into landfills we use the majority of 

 

that recovered fiber in our own paper mills to make new products all of the virgin fiber used by our paper mills in north america is certified through the sustainable forestry initiative’s fiber sourcing standard 

by operating across the entire supply chain we are an example of the circular economy in action using raw materials that are either recovered or that in many instances can be reused recycled or composted in a more sustainable “closed loop” business model our customers are increasingly interested in our commitment to sustainability as our progress with developing more sustainable products helps them achieve their sustainability goals

other examples of our commitment to sustainability include having one of the industry’s largest certified virgin fiber procurement systems and heading industryleading foodservice recycling initiatives we have been recognized for our sustainability efforts through among other things industry award programs and inclusion in the ftse 4 good index 

we are committed to our vision of imagining and delivering on the promise of a more sustainable future to create longterm value for our people communities customers and the planet

patents and other intellectual property

we hold a substantial number of foreign and domestic trademarks trademark applications trade names patents patent applications and licenses relating to our business our products and our production processes our patent portfolio consists primarily of utility and design patents relating to our products and manufacturing operations it also includes exclusive rights to substantial proprietary packaging system technology in the us or other licenses obtained from a third party our brand name and logo and certain of our products and services are protected by domestic and foreign trademark rights our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights particularly those relating to our converting operations are important to our operations as a whole our intellectual property has various expiration dates

employees

at september 30 2020 we employed approximately 49300 people of which approximately 78 were located in the us and canada and 22 were located in europe south america mexico and asia pacific of the approximately 49300 employees approximately 71 were hourly and 29 were salaried approximately 56 of our hourly employees in the us and canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements “ cbas ” which typically have four to sixyear terms approximately 21 of those employees covered under cbas are operating under agreements that expire within one year and approximately 15 of those employees are working under expired contracts 

while we have experienced isolated work stoppages in the past we have been able to resolve them and we believe that working relationships with our employees are generally good while the terms of our cbas vary we believe the material terms of the agreements are customary for the industry the type of facility the classification of the employees and the geographic location covered

in december 2019 the united steelworkers union “ usw ” ratified a new master agreement that applies to substantially all of our us facilities represented by the usw the agreement has a fouryear term and covers a number of specific items including wages medical coverage and certain other benefit programs substance abuse testing and safety individual facilities will continue to have local agreements for subjects not covered by the master agreement and those agreements will continue to have staggered terms the master agreement permits us to apply its terms to usw employees who work at facilities we acquire during the term of the agreement including most former meadwestvaco corporation kapstone and other acquired facilities the master agreement covers approximately 63 of our us operating locations and approximately 8700 of our employees

see item 1a “ risk factors — we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters ” 

 

human capital 

human capital management 

the attraction retention and development of exceptional teammates is critical to our success we accomplish this in part by developing the capabilities of our team members through our continuous learning development and performance management programs these programs include our safety six sigma supply chain leadership excellence commercial excellence and manager fundamentals programs we sponsor early in career rotations and college hire programs that support our functions and local operations we build partnerships with schools universities and associations to promote future careers in manufacturing

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more occur could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock par value 001 per share “ common stock ” in evaluating us our business and a potential investment in our securities you should consider the following risk factors and the other information presented in this report as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec the risks addressed below are not the only ones we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely impact our business

industry risks

we may experience pricing variability

our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue experiencing cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product prices for our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in the industries within which we compete and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which may be unpredictable and volatile if supply exceeds demand prices for our products could decline and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected for example we believe that the trading price of our common stock has been adversely affected in recent years due in part to concerns about announcements by certain of our competitors of planned additional capacity in the north american containerboard market as well as the subsequent implementation of certain of those plans

certain published indices including those published by pulp and paper week “ ppw ” contribute to the setting of selling prices for some of our products ppw is a limited survey that may not accurately reflect changes in market conditions for our products changes in how ppw is maintained or other indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the selling prices for these products

our earnings are highly dependent on volumes

because our operations generally have high fixed operating cost components our earnings are highly dependent on volumes which tend to fluctuate these fluctuations make it difficult to predict our financial results with any degree of certainty volumes for certain of the products that we produce were significantly impacted in fiscal 2020 by covid19 the pandemic has affected our operational and financial performance and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance will continue to depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic efforts of the 

 

pandemic and related containment measures among others any failure to maintain volumes may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation

we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials energy sources and thirdparty companies to transport our goods

the costs of recycled fiber and virgin fiber the principal externally sourced raw materials for our paper mills are subject to pricing variability due to market and industry conditions demand for recycled fiber has fluctuated and may increase due to among other factors the addition of new recycled paper mill capacity increasing demand for products packaged in packaging produced from paper manufactured from 100 recycled fiber and the shift by manufacturers of virgin paperboard tissue newsprint and corrugated packaging to the production of products with some recycled fiber content in 2018 china implemented a ban on the importation of some categories of recyclable materials including mixed paper and set strict contamination levels for other recovered paper imports which resulted in higher levels of recycled fiber supply in the us and lower associated costs for usbased recycled fiber paper mills in 2020 we experienced periods of increased recycled fiber costs including those driven by the impact of covid19 beginning in 2021 china has announced that it will ban all imports of solid waste including unsorted mixed papers which may impact the cost of recycled fiber in the markets in which we compete and benefit producers that have a high concentration of recycled fiber mills

the market price of virgin fiber varies based on availability and source of virgin fiber and the availability of virgin fiber may be impacted by among other factors weather conditions in fiscal 2019 for instance the profitability of our us operations was adversely impacted by wet weather conditions which adversely impacted the availability of virgin fiber at some of our mills in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations fluctuate which impacts our manufacturing costs certain published indices contribute to price setting for some of our raw materials and future changes in how these indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the pricing of these raw materials

the cost of natural gas which we use in many of our manufacturing operations including many of our mills and other energy costs including energy generated by burning natural gas fuel oil biomass and coal has at times fluctuated significantly high energy costs could increase our operating costs and make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors

we distribute our products primarily by truck and rail although we also distribute some of our products by cargo ship the reduced availability of trucks rail cars or cargo ships could adversely impact our ability to distribute our products in a timely manner high transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors 

because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the cost of raw materials energy or transportation through price increases for our products the failure to obtain raw materials energy or transportation services at reasonable market prices or the failure to pass on price increases to our customers or a reduction in the availability of raw materials energy or transportation services due to increased demand significant changes in climate or weather conditions or other factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we face intense competition

we compete in industries that are highly competitive our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies we generally compete with companies operating in north america although we have operations spanning north america south america europe asia and australia factors affecting our ability to compete include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors’ pricing strategies the introduction by our competitors of new technologies and equipment our ability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our ability to maintain the costefficiency of our facilities in addition changes within these industries including the consolidation of our competitors and our customers may impact competitive dynamics if our competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our results of 

 

operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal customer shifts away from containerboard and paperboard packaging to packaging made from other materials could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

operating risks

our business has been and will continue to be impacted by the outbreak of the covid19 novel coronavirus

 

the global impact of covid19 continues to evolve rapidly covid19 has impacted our operations and financial performance and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance in future periods will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures among others

in response to the spread of covid19 governmental authorities implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus including travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelterinplace and work from home orders and shutdowns of socalled “nonessential” businesses these measures have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operations as well as those of our customers vendors and suppliers we have manufacturing operations in the us canada brazil mexico australia china and in europe and each of these countries or regions has been affected by the outbreak of covid19 and taken various measures to try to contain it among other impacts to our business from the outbreak of covid19

 



 

our business has been and will continue to be impacted by the outbreak of the covid19 novel coronavirus and these impacts may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial conditions and the trading price of our common stock

 

we may be unsuccessful in making and integrating mergers acquisitions and investments and completing divestitures 

we have completed a number of mergers acquisitions investments and divestitures in recent years including the combination of meadwestvaco corporation and rocktenn company “ rocktenn ” in fiscal 2015 to form westrock the “ combination ” our investments in gondi sa de cv “ grupo gondi ” beginning in fiscal 2016 the spinoff of our specialty chemicals business in fiscal 2016 the sale of our home health and beauty business a former division of our consumer packaging segment “ hhb ” in fiscal 2017 the acquisition of multi packaging solutions international limited a bermuda exempted company “ mps ” or “ mps acquisition ” in fiscal 2017 and the kapstone acquisition in fiscal 2019 and we may acquire invest in or sell or enter into joint ventures with additional companies we may not be able to identify suitable targets or purchasers or successfully complete suitable transactions in the future and completed transactions may not be successful these transactions create risks including but not limited to risks associated with

 



mergers acquisitions and investments may not be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers that place higher strategic value on these businesses and assets than we do for acquisitions our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of realizing them depend on the successful integration of the acquired businesses and operations with our business and operations even if we integrate these businesses and operations successfully we may not realize the full benefits we expected within the anticipated timeframe or at all and the benefits may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays

we expect the kapstone acquisition to generate runrate synergies and performance improvements of more than 200 million by the end of fiscal 2021 the success of the kapstone acquisition will depend on among other things our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities cost savings and other synergies if we are not able to successfully integrate kapstone within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected cost savings and synergies and other benefits of the kapstone acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer or cost us more to realize than expected the combined businesses may not perform as expected management’s time and energy may be diverted and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

 

our acquisition of kapstone subjects us to various risks and uncertainties 

as a result of the kapstone acquisition we are subject to various risks and uncertainties including the following 



any one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may incur business disruptions

the operations at our manufacturing facilities may be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks including but not limited to risks associated with



for example in 2018 operations at our florence sc and panama city fl mills were interrupted by hurricanes resulting in lost mill production and the incurrence of damages supply chain disruptions and increased input costs see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information also in 2019 and 2020 operations at three of our mills located in the southeastern us and operations at our evadale tx and hodge la mills respectively were interrupted by hurricanes resulting in lost mill production and in fiscal 2020 we experienced a flood at our operations in guangzhou china that negatively impacted our operations

business disruptions may impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences

our success depends in part on our ability to offer differentiated solutions and we must continually develop and introduce new products and services to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments and changing customer preferences the services and products that we offer customers may not meet their needs as their business models evolve also our customers may decide to decrease their use of our products use alternative 

 

materials for their product packaging or forego the packaging of certain products entirely regulatory developments can also significantly alter the market for our products for example a move to electronic distribution of disclaimers and other paperless regimes could adversely impact our healthcare inserts and labels businesses similarly new jersey adopted a law in november 2020 banning singleuse paper bags and a number of other states charge businesses or customers fees to use paper bags these and similar developments could adversely impact demand for certain of our products 

consumer preferences for products and packaging formats are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience and health environmental and social concerns and perceptions for example changing consumer dietary habits and preferences have slowed the sales growth for certain of the food and beverage products that we package also there is an increasing focus among consumers to ensure that products delivered through ecommerce are packaged efficiently for instance in 2019 amazon began requiring all items sold through amazon that are larger than a specified size to be designed and certified as readytoship our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences

our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated

we regularly make capital expenditures and many of our capital projects are complex costly andor implemented over an extended period of time for example in october 2020 we started up our strategic capital project at our florence sc mill in fiscal 2020 we completed a reconfiguration of our charleston sc mill and we continue to invest in a strategic project at our tres barras brazil mill our capital expenditures for these and other capital projects could be higher than we anticipated we may experience unanticipated business disruptions andor we may not achieve the desired benefits from the capital projects any of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in addition disputes between us and contractors who are involved with implementing capital projects could lead to timeconsuming and costly litigation

we are exposed to risks related to international sales and operations

we derived 177 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected by risks related to the countries outside the us in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil china mexico and india are exposed to varying degrees of economic political and social instability in addition these countries’ economies and operating environments have been and likely will continue to be adversely impacted to varying degrees by covid19 we are exposed to risks of operating in those countries as well as others including but not limited to risks associated with



 

any one or more of these risks could adversely affect our international operations and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we cannot operate our joint ventures solely for our benefit which subjects us to risks

we have invested in joint ventures and may form additional joint ventures in the future our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks including but not limited to risks associated with



we may produce faulty or contaminated products due to failures in quality control measures and systems

our failure to produce products that meet safety and quality standards could result in adverse effects on consumer health litigation exposure loss of market share and adverse financial impacts among other potential consequences and we may incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action up to and including recalling products from end consumers and to reimburse customers andor end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of these failures our actions or omissions with respect to product safety and quality could lead to regulatory investigations enforcement actions andor prosecutions and result in adverse publicity which may damage our reputation any of these results could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we provide guarantees or representations in certain of our contracts that our products are produced in accordance with customer specifications if the product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated the manufacturer of the product may allege that the packaging we provided caused the fault or contamination even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications if our packaging fails to function properly or to preserve the integrity of its contents we could face liability from our customers and third parties for bodily injury or other damages these liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we depend on certain large customers

our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments have large customers the loss of which could adversely affect each segment’s sales and depending on the significance of the loss our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in particular because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly bid for new business or for the renewal of existing business the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may adversely impact our financial results

we are subject to cybersecurity risks including related to customer employee vendor or other company data

we use information technologies to securely manage operations and various business functions we rely on various technologies some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information in addition we facilitate a variety of business processes and activities including reporting on our business and interacting with customers vendors and employees we also collect and store data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information that is subject to 

 

privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls our systems are subject to recurring attempts by third parties to access information or to disrupt our operations despite our security design and controls and those of our thirdparty providers we may become subject to system damage disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes including cyberattacks breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages telecommunication or utility failures systems failures service provider failures natural disasters or other catastrophic events these vulnerabilities may remain undetected for an extended period of time we may face other challenges and risks during our integration of acquired businesses and operations as we upgrade and standardize our information technology systems we maintain contingency plans and processes to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events however these events could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data and depending on their nature and scope could lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and exposure to liability such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions including reputational damage and legal claims or proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters

a significant number of our union employees are governed by cbas expired contracts are in the process of renegotiation and others expire within one year we may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts without work stoppages or labor difficulties or renegotiate them on favorable terms we have experienced work stoppages in the past and may experience them in the future if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected in addition our businesses rely on vendors suppliers and other third parties that have union employees strikes or work stoppages affecting these vendors suppliers and other third parties could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel including key personnel

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate train and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers the increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire if we fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel or if we experience excessive turnover we may experience declining sales manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies increased recruiting training and relocation costs and other difficulties and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted

we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively the loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted in particular our failure to identify candidates with the leadership skills to manage our increasingly complex organization and our failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key executives could hinder our strategic planning and execution

financial risks

we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change

our businesses may be adversely affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control including but not limited to



 



for example we may experience lower demand for our products and the products of our customers that utilize our products if economic conditions in the us and globally including in europe brazil and mexico deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates lower family income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment or lower consumer spending in 2020 unemployment rates in the principal geographic markets that we serve increased significantly and gross domestic product in these markets decreased significantly in each case due to covid19 these trends resulted in generally lower levels of demand for our products which adversely impacted our financial results in addition changes in trade policy including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs could impact demand for our products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments macroeconomic challenges may also lead to changes in tax laws or tax rates that may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities we are not able to predict with certainty economic and financial market conditions and social and political change and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected by adverse market conditions and social and political change

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business

at september 30 2020 we had 94 billion of debt outstanding the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences including



 

certain of our variable rate debt uses the london interbank offered rate “ libor ” as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate the uk financial conduct authority intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in addition other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt 

we are subject to agreements that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants and may restrict us from among other things disposing of assets and incurring additional indebtedness these restrictions may limit our flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures

credit rating downgrades could increase our borrowing costs or otherwise adversely affect us

some of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from rating agencies our credit ratings could change based on among other things our results of operations and financial condition credit ratings are 

 

subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a “watch list” for a possible downgrade or assigned a “negative outlook” actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could increase our borrowing costs which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock if a downgrade were to occur or a negative outlook were to be assigned it could impact our ability to access the capital markets to raise debt andor increase the associated costs in addition while our credit ratings are important to us we may take actions and otherwise operate our business in a manner that adversely affects our credit ratings 

we sell shortterm receivables from certain customer trade accounts on a revolving basis any downgrade of the credit rating or deterioration of the financial condition of these customers may make it more costly or difficult for us to engage in these activities which could adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity

we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a writedown would adversely impact our operating results and shareholders’ equity 

at september 30 2020 the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was 96 billion we review the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when impairment indicators exist the impairment test requires us to analyze a number of factors and make estimates that require judgment in fiscal 2020 we recorded a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of approximately 13 billion in our consumer packaging reporting unit the rest of our reporting units had fair values that exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows changes in our business strategy and external market conditions among other factors could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net income if a significant write down were required the charge could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and shareholders’ equity and could impact the trading price of our common stock see “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — goodwill and longlived assets ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring

we have previously restructured portions of our operations and likely will engage in future restructuring initiatives because we are not able to predict with certainty market conditions including changes in the supply and demand for our products the loss of large customers the selling prices for our products or our manufacturing costs we may not be able to predict with certainty the appropriate time to undertake restructurings the cash and noncash costs associated with these activities vary depending on the type of facility impacted with the noncash cost of a mill closure generally being more significant than that of a converting facility due to the higher level of investment restructuring activities may divert the attention of management disrupt our operations and fail to achieve the intended cost and operations benefits

we may utilize our cash flow or incur additional indebtedness to satisfy certain payment obligations related to or otherwise increase our investment in grupo gondi

in connection with our investment in the joint venture with grupo gondi we entered into an option agreement pursuant to which we and certain shareholders of grupo gondi agreed to future put and call options with respect to the equity interests in the joint venture held by each party we own 323 of the joint venture pursuant to the option agreement prior to april 1 2021 we may exercise a right to purchase an additional 187 equity interest in grupo gondi from our joint venture partners at a predetermined purchase price if we exercise our right to purchase the additional 187 equity interest our partners may elect to sell us their remaining interest at fair market value at that time or a portion thereof in the future in accordance with the terms of the option agreement in addition in the event that we do not exercise our right to purchase the additional 187 equity interest our joint venture partners may call our 323 equity interest at a predetermined price between october 1 2021 and april 1 2022 these arrangements or other arrangements pursuant to which we increase our ownership in grupo gondi may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to satisfy our payment or investment obligations which may reduce the amount of funds available for our operations capital expenditures and corporate development activities also we may be required to incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities in order to satisfy our payment or investment obligations 

 

we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps 

we participate in several mepps our contributions to any particular mepp may increase based on the declining funded status of a mepp and legal requirements such as those of the pension act which require substantially underfunded mepps to implement a funding improvement plan “ fip ” or a rehabilitation plan “ rp ” to improve their funded status the funded status of a mepp may be impacted by among other items a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans the inability or failure of companies withdrawing from the plan to pay their withdrawal liability low interest rates changes in actuarial assumptions andor lower than expected returns on pension fund assets

we believe that certain of the mepps in which we participate or have participated including piumpf have material unfunded vested benefits in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from piumpf and the central states southeast and southwest areas pension fund “ central states ” and recorded aggregate withdrawal liabilities of 1842 million nearly all of which was for piumpf which includes an estimate of our portion of piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency we may withdraw from other mepps in the future

in september 2019 we received a demand from piumpf asserting that we owe 1703 million on an undiscounted basis approximately 07 million per month for the next 20 years with respect to our withdrawal liability the demand did not address any assertion of liability for piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency we began making monthly payments for the withdrawal liability in fiscal 2020 in february 2020 we received a demand letter from piumpf asserting that we owe 512 million for our prorata share of piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency including interest we expect to challenge the accumulated funding deficiency demand the impact of increased contributions future funding obligations or future withdrawal liabilities may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including our estimated withdrawal liabilities and a summary of all the demand letters we received from piumpf

legal and regulatory risks

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign laws regulations and other requirements including those relating to the environment product safety competition corruption occupational health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax and health care these laws regulations and other requirements may change or be applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our equipment andor operations subject us to enforcement risk expose us to reputational harm or impose on or require us to incur additional costs including substantial compliance costs which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental regulations our environmental expenditures include those related to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater including situations where we have been identified as a prp because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws and our compliance costs could increase materially future compliance with existing and new laws and requirements may disrupt our business operations and require significant expenditures and our existing reserves for specific matters may not be adequate to cover future costs in particular our manufacturing operations consume significant amounts of energy and we may in the future incur additional or increased capital operating and other expenditures from changes due to new or increased climaterelated and other environmental regulations we could also incur substantial liabilities including fines or sanctions enforcement actions natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury under environmental and common laws 

the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 and local antibribery laws including those in brazil china mexico india and the united kingdom where we maintain operations directly or through a joint venture prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of influencing official decisions our internal control policies and procedures or those of our vendors may not adequately protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed or alleged to have been committed by our employees agents or 

 

vendors any such violations could lead to civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties andor could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of labor and employment and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility additionally changing privacy laws in the united states where the california consumer privacy act became effective in 2020 europe where the general data protection regulation became effective in 2018 and elsewhere have created new individual privacy rights imposed increased obligations on companies handling personal data and increased potential exposure to fines and penalties

executive summary 

 



 

 

in fiscal 2020 we continued to pursue our strategy of offering differentiated and sustainable paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win as a result of our broad portfolio 160 customers bought at least 1 million from both our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments in fiscal 2020 net sales of 175788 million for fiscal 2020 decreased 7102 million or 39 compared to fiscal 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower selling pricemix and lower volumes excluding acquisitions including the impact of covid19 as well as unfavorable foreign currency impacts across our segments

 

segment income decreased 4274 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segment income a detailed review of our performance appears below under “ results of operations ”

 

we generated 20707 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 compared to 23102 million in fiscal 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower earnings largely due to lower selling pricemix lower volumes excluding acquisitions including covid19 as well as other factors given the uncertainties associated with the severity and duration of covid19 as discussed below in may 2020 we implemented the westrock pandemic action plan see “ covid19 response — westrock pandemic action plan ” for more information we invested 9781 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 while returning 3445 million in dividends to our stockholders we believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest to sustain and improve our operating performance see “ liquidity and capital resources ” for more information 

loss per diluted share was 267 in fiscal 2020 compared to earnings per diluted share of 333 in fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings per diluted share were 275 and 398 in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively the loss per diluted share in fiscal 2020 was driven by a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of 13332 million in our consumer packaging reporting unit 

a detailed review of our fiscal 2020 and 2019 performance appears below under “ results of operations ”

 

expectations for fiscal 2021 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

 

we expect to generate strong cash flows and reduce our debt meaningfully in fiscal 2021 we expect capital investments to be 800 to 900 million which is higher than the estimates that we incorporated into the westrock pandemic action plan due to specific growth projects that we subsequently identified we expect to complete the tres barras mill upgrade in the first half of 2021 and to add more than 125 million in ebitda in fiscal 2021 from capturing synergies related to the kapstone acquisition the new paper machine at our florence sc mill our box plant in porto feliz brazil and the reconfiguration at our north charleston sc mill we expect that our financial results in fiscal 2021 will continue to be impacted by covid19 see “ covid19 response — end market segment demand trends ” and “ covid19 response — health and safety of our teammates ” for additional information 

 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we expect a sequential decline in net sales and earnings from the fourth quarter reflecting the normal seasonal sequential volume declines in many of our businesses we expect higher north american corrugated box shipments to be offset by three fewer shipping days during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 while volume should remain strong in brazil we will execute a significant outage to support our tres barras mill upgrade and estimate 27000 tons of maintenance downtime we also expect higher energy and transportation costs entering the winter season along with increased health insurance costs prior to the annual reset of employee deductibles in addition our shortterm incentive payouts for fiscal 2020 were below target as 

 

part of our pandemic action plan and we will begin accruing shortterm incentive payouts for fiscal 2021 at a target level that is higher than the payout level for fiscal 2020 

 

covid19 response 

 

westrock pandemic action plan 

 

in fiscal 2020 we executed our differentiated strategy with financial strength and substantial liquidity and we adapted quickly to changing market conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic given the uncertainties associated with the severity and duration of the pandemic in may 2020 we announced and began implementing the westrock pandemic action plan we have modified the westrock pandemic action plan as the impact of covid19 has continued and we may further modify it in the future by for example changing our capital expenditure assumptions future estimates or the duration of the planned items we expect that the actions that we have undertaken and will continue to undertake pursuant to the plan will provide an additional 1 billion in cash through the end of fiscal 2021 that we will be able to use to reduce our outstanding indebtedness pursuant to the westrock pandemic action plan we committed ourselves to

 





















in fiscal 2020 we achieved more than 350 million of the 1 billion goal set forth in the westrock pandemic action plan we expect that our actions under the westrock pandemic action plan will continue to position us both to sustain our business in a range of economic and market conditions and for longterm success

 

health and safety of our teammates 

 

our first priority is the health and safety of our teammates we have taken and continue to take actions to protect the health and safety of our teammates during covid19 including  

 





 







 

we have also implemented health questionnaires and temperature screenings in compliance with applicable law and launched an online coronavirus resource center to keep our teammates up to date on company and health authority information including information from the world health organization and the us centers for disease control and prevention 

 

during fiscal 2020 we provided onetime covid19 recognition awards to our teammates who work in manufacturing and operations and recognized expense of 316 million for those awards during fiscal 2020 we also incurred an additional expense of 324 million for cleaning safety supplies and equipment screening resources and other items we expect to continue to incur expenses for these items as needed in the future 

 

business continuity 

 

our business is an essential part of the global supply chain our paper and packaging products enable our customers to package essential food beverage health products cleaning products and other goods we are continuing to operate and meet or exceed our customers’ needs in this rapidly evolving demand environment

 

we formed a business continuity team comprised of senior leaders throughout our organization that develops and implements business continuity plans to ensure that our operations are well positioned to continue producing and delivering products to customers without disruption the business continuity team meets regularly to identify and address issues as they arise and focuses on taking actions that address current circumstances associated with covid19 while positioning us for future growth

 

financial flexibility and liquidity 

 

we expect the resetting of our dividend from 0465 per share to 020 per share will allow for in excess of 400 million to be available for debt repayment through the end of fiscal 2021 

 

in june 2020 wrkco issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of its 300 senior notes due 2033 a t september 30 2020 we had approximately 36 billion of availability under longterm committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents we have limited debt maturities prior to march 2022 we believe that we have substantial liquidity to navigate the current dynamic environment and remain focused on maintaining our investment grade rating and managing our working capital and taking appropriate actions to ensure our access to necessary liquidity 

 

the cares act allows employers to postpone paying their share of employment taxes incurred through the end of calendar year 2020 we expect to postpone an estimated 120 million of such payments over the three quarters ended december 31 2020 and will be required to pay 50 of these amounts in december 2021 and the remaining 50 in december 2022

 

end market segment demand trends 

 

end market demand trends continue to be impacted by covid19 since the onset of covid19 w e have experienced strong sequential demand from the ecommerce food and healthcare end markets as we exited the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 corrugated container volumes increased and october 2020 shipments continued to rise as compared to the prior year however we have also experienced lower sales in other market segments including specialty solid bleached sulphate “ sbs ” especially for commercial print tobacco plate and cup stock markets although we are not certain whether these trends will continue into future reporting periods and if so for how long and to what degree we believe the decline in specialty sbs in particular for certain end markets is more systemic our view of related growth and earnings opportunities has been diminished in the foreseeable future as 

 

a result of the expected lower volumes and cash flows in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 13 billion pretax in our consumer packaging reporting unit in october 2020 we announced the shutdown of one of our sbs paper machines at our evadale tx mill which will result in the removal of 200000 tons of capacity 

 

we believe that our diverse portfolio of sustainable fiberbased paper and packaging solutions positions us well to adapt and meet our customers’ changing needs across a broad crosssection of the economy in particular for customers and markets that have had increased demand the scale of our operations has enabled us to partner with our customers to support these needs 

 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes our consolidated results for the two years ended september 30 2020

 



net sales unaffiliated customers 

net sales in fiscal 2020 decreased 7102 million or 39 compared to fiscal 2019 the decrease was primarily due to lower selling pricemix and lower volumes excluding acquisitions including the impact of covid19 as well as unfavorable foreign currency impacts across our segments these decreases were partially offset by higher containerboard volumes and the impact of the kapstone acquisition as the prior year included only eleven months of kapstone ownership the transaction closed on november 2 2018 the change in net sales by segment is outlined below in “ results of operations — corrugated packaging segment ” and “ results of operations — consumer packaging segment ”

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold decreased to 143816 million in fiscal 2020 compared to 145400 million in fiscal 2019 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 818 in fiscal 2020 compared to 795 in fiscal 2019 the decrease in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in net sales 

 

productivity improvements net cost deflation and lower depreciation which were partially offset by increased cost of goods sold associated with the impact of acquisitions primarily an additional month of kapstone ownership in fiscal 2020 onetime covid19 recognition awards to our teammates who work in manufacturing and operations and other manufacturing cost increases including increased costs resulting from the north charleston sc mill reconfiguration and florence sc mill strategic capital project as well as increased costs for safety cleaning and other items related to covid19 in fiscal 2020 and 2019 we incurred approximately 45 million and 1139 million respectively of direct costs and property damage associated with hurricane michael and received hurricane michaelrelated insurance proceeds of 323 million and 1800 million respectively which were recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold in our corrugated packaging segment the insurance proceeds were for 206 million and 1247 million of direct costs and property damage for fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively and for 117 million and 553 million for business interruption recoveries respectively see “ hurricane michael ” below for additional information in fiscal 2020 and 2019 we recorded a reduction of cost of goods sold of 321 million and 114 million respectively in connection with an indirect tax claim in brazil primarily in the corrugated packaging segment see “ note 18 commitments and contingencies — indirect tax claim ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information in fiscal 2019 we recorded a 247 million acquisition inventory stepup charge in our corrugated packaging segment related to the kapstone acquisition we discuss these items in greater detail below in “ results of operations — corrugated packaging segment ” and “ results of operations — consumer packaging segment ”  

selling general and administrative excluding intangible amortization 

selling general and administrative expenses “ sga ” excluding intangible amortization decreased 908 million to 16244 million in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 in part due to a 313 million reduction in bonus compensation expense primarily associated with the pandemic action plan a 383 million reduction in travel and entertainment and other reductions associated with the implementation of shelterinplace orders that were initiated in response to covid19 decreases for fiscal 2020 were partially offset by an additional month of kapstone ownership in fiscal 2020 as well as a 99 million increase in bad debt expense compared to the prior year sga excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of net sales declined in fiscal 2020 to 92 from 94 in fiscal 2019

selling general and administrative intangible amortization 

sga intangible amortization was 4005 million and 4002 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively fiscal 2020 included an additional month of kapstone ownership in fiscal 2020 

gain on disposal of assets 

the gain on disposal of assets in fiscal 2020 was 163 million and the gain on disposal of assets in fiscal 2019 was 412 million the gain on disposal of assets in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the 485 million gain on sale of our former atlanta beverage facility recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

land and development impairments 

in fiscal 2019 we recorded 130 million of pretax noncash impairments of certain mineral rights following the termination of a third party leasing relationship this charge is not reflected in segment income 

restructuring and other costs 

we recorded aggregate pretax restructuring and other costs of 1127 million and 1737 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively these amounts are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with each restructuring acquisition integration or divestiture vary we generally expect the integration of a closed facility’s assets and production with other facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility see “ note 4 restructuring and other costs ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including a description of the type of costs incurred we have restructured portions of our operations from time to time and it is likely that we will engage in additional restructuring opportunities in the future see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring ” 

 

goodwill impairment 

in fiscal 2020 we recorded a pretax noncash goodwill impairment of 13332 million in our consumer packaging reporting unit the impairment is described below in “ critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates — goodwill ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements

interest expense net 

interest expense net was 3935 million and 4313 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively interest expense net in fiscal 2020 decreased primarily due to 205 million of interest income recorded in connection with an indirect tax claim in brazil compared to 08 million in fiscal 2019 lower levels of debt and lower interest rates in the current year period these increases were partially offset by an additional month of interest expense associated with the kapstone acquisition in the current year compared to the prior year see “ note 18 commitments and contingencies — indirect tax claim ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see item 1a “ risk factors — the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ” 

pension and other postretirement nonservice income 

pension and other postretirement nonservice income was 1033 million and 742 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively the increases were primarily due to the increase in plan asset balances used to determine the expected return on plan assets for fiscal 2020 customary pension and other postretirement income costs are included in segment income see “ note 5 retirement plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information

other income net 

other income net was 95 million and 24 million in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively 

provision for income taxes 

 

we recorded income tax expense of 1635 million for fiscal 2020 at an effective tax rate of 313 due to the loss before income tax in fiscal 2020 compared to an income tax expense of 2768 million at an effective tax rate of 242 in fiscal 2019 excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment which was largely not tax deductible our effective tax rate was 225 see “note 6 income taxes ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including a table reconciling the statutory federal tax rate to our effective tax rate

impact of covid19 in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we have made onetime covid19 recognition awards to our manufacturing and operations teammates and incurred increased costs for safety cleaning and other items related to covid19 of approximately 251 million 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

we fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures mergers acquisitions and investments restructuring activities dividends and stock repurchases from net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from our ar sales agreement as hereinafter defined proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment removed from service and proceeds received in connection with the issuance of debt and equity securities see “ note 13 debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information funding for our domestic operations in the foreseeable future is expected to come from sources of liquidity within our domestic operations including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facilities as such our foreign cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be a key source of liquidity to our domestic operations 

cash and cash equivalents were 2511 million at september 30 2020 and 1516 million at september 30 2019 approximately onehalf of the cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2020 were held outside of the us at september 30 2020 total debt was 94306 million 2229 million of which was current at september 30 2019 total debt was 100634 million 5611 million of which was current included in our total debt at september 30 2020 was 2089 million of noncash acquisition related stepup total debt declined compared to the prior year primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities exceeding aggregate capital expenditures and dividends by 7481 million which was partially offset by a 995 million increase in our cash and cash equivalents balance this includes the achievement of more than 350 million of the 1 billion goal set forth in the westrock pandemic action plan in addition debt was also increased by 1003 million related to our october 1 2019 adoption of the leasing guidance codified in financial accounting standards board’s “ fasb ” accounting standards codification “ asc ” 842 “ leases”  “ asc 842 ” that recharacterized 1003 million from shortterm and longterm liabilities for two chip mills to a finance lease obligation

in june 2020 wrkco issued 6000 million aggregate principal amount of its 300 senior notes due 2033 the “ june 2033 notes ” we may redeem the june 2033 notes in whole or in part at any time at specified redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest if any the proceeds from the issuance of the june 2033 notes were primarily used to repay the 1000 million principal amount of westrock mwv llc’s “ mwv ” 975 notes due june 2020 and reduce outstanding indebtedness under our receivables securitization facility and revolving credit facility each as hereinafter defined see “ note 13 debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

at september 30 2020 we had approximately 36 billion of availability under longterm committed credit facilities and cash and cash equivalents our primary availability is under our revolving credit facilities and receivables securitization facility the majority of which matures on november 21 2024 this liquidity may be used to provide for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes including acquisitions dividends and stock repurchases we have limited debt maturities prior to march 2022

certain restrictive covenants govern our maximum availability under the credit facilities we test and report our compliance with these covenants as required by these facilities and were in compliance with all of these covenants at september 30 2020

at september 30 2020 we had 629 million of outstanding letters of credit not drawn upon

 

we use a variety of working capital management strategies including supply chain financing  scf  programs vendor financing and commercial card programs a monetization facility where we sell shortterm receivables to a group of thirdparty financial institutions and a receivables securitization facility we describe these programs below and in the notes to consolidated financial statements

we engage in certain customerbased scf programs to accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding accounts receivables from certain customers certain costs of these programs are borne by the customer or us receivables transferred under these customerbased supply chain finance programs generally meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales in accordance with guidance under asc 860 “transfers and servicing” 

 

resulting in derecognition of such receivables from our consolidated balance sheets receivables involved with these customerbased supply chain finance programs constitute approximately 2 of our annual net sales in addition we have a monetization facility which sells to a thirdparty financial institution all of the shortterm receivables generated from certain customer trade accounts for a discussion of our monetization facility see “ note 12 fair value — ar sales agreement ” 

our working capital management strategy includes working with our suppliers to revisit terms and conditions including the extension of payment terms our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers generally range from payable upon receipt to 120 days and vary for items such as the availability of cash discounts we do not believe our payment terms will be shortened significantly in the near future and we do not expect our net cash provided by operating activities to be significantly impacted by additional extensions of payment terms certain financial institutions offer voluntary scf programs that enable our suppliers at their sole discretion to sell their receivables from us to the financial institutions on a nonrecourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus might be more beneficial to our suppliers we and our suppliers agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure including prices quantities and payment terms regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in scf programs the suppliers sell us goods or services and issue the associated invoices to us based on the agreedupon contractual terms the due dates of the invoices are not extended due to the supplier’s participation in scf programs our suppliers at their sole discretion if they choose to participate in a scf program determine which invoices if any they want to sell to the financial institutions no guarantees are provided by us under scf programs and we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the scf program therefore amounts due to our suppliers that elect to participate in scf programs are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet and the activity is reflected in net cash provided by operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows based on correspondence with the financial institutions that are involved with our two primary scf programs while the amount suppliers elect to sell to the financial institutions varies from period to period the amount generally averages approximately 15 of our accounts payable balance

we also participate in certain vendor financing and commercial card programs to support our travel and entertainment expenses and smaller vendor purchases amounts outstanding under these programs are classified as debt primarily because we receive the benefit of extended payment terms and a rebate from the financial institution that we would not have otherwise received without the financial institutions’ involvement we also have a receivables securitization facility as defined herein that allows for borrowing availability based on the eligible underlying accounts receivable and compliance with certain covenants for a discussion of our receivables securitization facility and the amount outstanding under our vendor financing and commercial card programs see “ note 13 debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

cash flow activity 

 



net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2020 decreased 2395 million from fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower consolidated net income and a 1177 million net increase in the use of working capital compared to the prior year 

net cash used for investing activities of 9215 million in fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of 9781 million for capital expenditures that was partially offset by 350 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment and 169 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance benefits net cash used for investing activities of 45796 million in fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of 33742 million for cash paid for the purchase of businesses net of cash acquired excluding the assumption of debt primarily related to the kapstone acquisition and 13691 million for capital expenditures that were partially offset by 1191 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment primarily related to the sale of our atlanta beverage facility 332 million of 

 

proceeds from corporate owned life insurance benefits and 255 million of proceeds from property plant and equipment insurance proceeds related to our panama city fl mill 

under the westrock pandemic action plan which we announced in may 2020 in response to the covid19 pandemic we expected to reduce our fiscal 2020 capital expenditures by approximately 150 million to approximately 950 million fiscal 2020 capital expenditures aggregated 9781 million in fiscal 2020 including work on our strategic projects at our florence sc and tres barras brazil mills we also had to navigate the impact of shelterinplace and other similar restrictions and the availability of contract and technical resources as a result of covid19 we started up the paper machine at our florence sc mill in october 2020 and expect to increase capacity during fiscal 2021 the tres barras mill upgrade project should be completed in the first half of 2021 with the expected completion of certain of our strategic projects we had expected to transition to our longrange capital expenditure runrate of approximately 900 million to 10 billion a year in fiscal 2021 we expect to invest 800 million to 900 million in fiscal 2021 which is higher than the estimates that we incorporated into the westrock pandemic action plan due to specific growth projects that we subsequently identified at these capital investment levels we are confident that we will continue to invest in the appropriate safety environmental and maintenance projects and complete our strategic mill projects while also making investments to support productivity and growth in our business however it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions may change project completion dates may change or we may decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify or changes in market conditions or to comply with environmental or other regulatory changes

in fiscal 2020 net cash used for financing activities of 10211 million consisted primarily of a net decrease in debt of 6739 million and cash dividends paid to stockholders of 3445 million in fiscal 2019 net cash provided by financing activities of 17802 million consisted primarily of a net increase in debt of 23146 million primarily related to the kapstone acquisition and partially offset by cash dividends paid to stockholders of 4679 million and purchases of common stock of 886 million

we estimate that we will invest approximately 27 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2021 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance we were obligated to purchase approximately 310 million of fixed assets at september 30 2020 for various capital projects see item 1a “ risk factors — our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated ” 

at september 30 2020 the us federal state and foreign net operating losses and other us federal and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately 78 million in future potential reductions of us federal state and foreign cash taxes based on our current projections we expect to utilize nearly all of the remaining us federal net operating losses and other us federal credits during the current fiscal year foreign and state net operating losses and credits will be used over a longer period of time our cash tax rate is highly dependent on our taxable income utilization of net operating losses and credits changes in tax laws or tax rates capital expenditures or other factors barring significant changes in our current assumptions including changes in tax laws or tax rates forecasted taxable income levels of capital expenditures and other items we expect our cash tax rate to be slightly higher than our income tax rate in fiscal 2021 2022 and 2023 primarily due to the absence of certain nonrecurring tax credits the reduction in capital investments as well as reversal of prior years’ accelerated tax depreciation causing taxable income to be higher

during fiscal 2020 and 2019 we made contributions of 225 million and 251 million respectively to our us and nonus pension plans based on current facts and assumptions we expect to contribute approximately 23 million to our us and nonus pension plans in fiscal 2021 we have made contributions and expect to continue to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the pension act and other regulations the net overfunded status of our us and nonus pension plans at september 30 2020 was 517 million based on current assumptions including future interest rates we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our us and nonus pension plans will be approximately 22 million to 23 million annually in fiscal 2022 through 2025 see “ note 5 retirement plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

in the normal course of business we evaluate our potential exposure to mepps including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from two plans and recorded an aggregate estimated withdrawal liability of 1842 million nearly all of which was for piumpf in september 2019 we received a demand from piumpf asserting that we owe 1703 million on an undiscounted basis approximately 07 million per month for the next 20 years with respect to our withdrawal liability the initial 

 

demand did not address any assertion of liability for piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency in october 2019 we received two additional demand letters from piumpf related to a subsidiary of ours asserting that we owe 23 million on an undiscounted basis to be paid over 20 years with respect to the subsidiary’s withdrawal liability and 20 million for its accumulated funding deficiency we received an updated demand letter decreasing the accumulated funding deficiency demand from 20 million to 13 million in april 2020 in february 2020 we received a demand letter from piumpf asserting that we owe 512 million for our prorata share of piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency including interest we are evaluating each of these demands and we expect to challenge the accumulated funding deficiency demands we began making monthly payments for these withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2020 excluding the accumulated funding deficiency demands see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps ” 

on may 5 2020 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 020 per share for an annual rate of 080 per share which was lower than our previous quarterly dividend paid in fiscal 2020 we believe that this reduction in our dividend was prudent given the uncertain market conditions driven by covid19 and allowed us to allocate additional cash to pay down our outstanding debt as the situation with covid19 continues to evolve we will reevaluate the level of our dividend in august 2020 may 2020 february 2020 and november 2019 we paid a quarterly dividend of 020 020 0465 and 0465 per share respectively for a total of 133 per share during fiscal 2019 we paid an annual dividend of 182 per share during fiscal 2018 we paid an annual dividend of 172 per share 

in july 2015 our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 400 million shares of our common stock representing approximately 15 of our outstanding common stock as of july 1 2015 shares of our common stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions the timing manner price and amount of repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on factors including the market price of our common stock general economic and market conditions and applicable legal requirements the repurchase program may be commenced suspended or discontinued at any time in fiscal 2020 we repurchased no shares of our common stock in fiscal 2019 we repurchased approximately 21 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 886 million as of september 30 2020 we had approximately 191 million shares of common stock available for repurchase under the program

we anticipate that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures interest payments dividends and stock repurchases pension payments working capital needs note repurchases restructuring activities repayments of current portion of longterm debt and other corporate actions for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from our ar sales agreement proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities or other additional longterm debt financing including new or amended facilities in addition we continually review our capital structure and conditions in the private and public debt markets in order to optimize our mix of indebtedness in connection with these reviews we may seek to refinance existing indebtedness to extend maturities reduce borrowing costs or otherwise improve the terms and composition of our indebtedness

contractual obligations 

we summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at september 30 2020 and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table certain amounts in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans because these estimates and assumptions are subjective the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those presented in the table

 

 



 



 



 



 



 







in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations presented in the table above we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business these contracts however are subject to change based on our business decisions

expenditures for environmental compliance

see item 1 “ business — governmental regulation — environmental ” and “ business — governmental regulation — climate change ” for a discussion of our expenditures for environmental compliance

 

nongaap financial measures 

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “ gaap ” however management believes certain nongaap financial measures provide investors and other users with additional meaningful information that should be considered when assessing our ongoing performance management also uses these nongaap financial measures in making financial operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our gaap results the nongaap financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures presented by other companies

we use the nongaap financial measures “adjusted net income” and “adjusted earnings per diluted share” 

 

management believes these measures provide our board of directors investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because they exclude restructuring and other costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business we and our board of directors use this information to evaluate our performance relative to other periods we believe that the most directly comparable gaap measures to adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share are net loss income attributable to common stockholders and loss earnings per diluted share respectively 

set forth below is a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure adjusted earnings per diluted share to loss earnings per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measure in dollars per share for the periods indicated

 



 

1 includes a 130 million impairment of mineral rights in fiscal 2019

 

 

the gaap results in the tables below for pretax tax and net of tax are equivalent to the line items “loss income before income taxes” “income tax expense benefit” and “consolidated net loss income” respectively as reported on the statements of operations set forth below are reconciliations of adjusted net income to the most directly comparable gaap measure net loss income attributable to common stockholders represented in the table below as the gaap results for consolidated net loss income ie net of tax less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the periods indicated in millions 

 



 



 

 

we discuss certain of these charges in more detail in “ note 4 restructuring and other costs ” and “ note 18 commitments and contingencies — indirect tax claim ”

critical accounting policies and significant accounting estimates

we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities reported certain significant accounting policies are described in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

these critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management’s most subjective and complex judgments the accounting for these 

 

matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts circumstances and assumptions that in management’s judgment could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and accordingly could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates 

goodwill

we review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value as set forth in asc 350 “intangibles — goodwill and other” we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component

asc 350 allows an optional qualitative assessment prior to a quantitative assessment test to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount we generally do not attempt a qualitative assessment and move directly to the quantitative test as part of the quantitative test we utilize the present value of expected cash flows or as appropriate a combination of the present value of expected cash flows and the guideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units this present value model requires management to estimate future cash flows the timing of these cash flows and a discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows the assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions that the reporting units use for internal planning purposes which we believe would be generally consistent with that of a market participant if we determine that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if we determine that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value we measure goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value as required under asu 201704  “ simplifying the test for goodwill impairment ” which we early adopted starting with our fiscal 2020 annual goodwill impairment test on july 1 2020 we describe our accounting policy for goodwill further in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — goodwill and longlived assets ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements

we began seeing the impact of covid19 in a limited manner at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020 the impact on our operations increased in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 during these interim periods we evaluated the current economic environment including our then current assessment of the longterm impact of covid19 on our forecasts and we concluded there were no indicators of impairment of our longlived assets including goodwill that required a quantitative test to be performed

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing we considered factors such as but not limited to our expectations for the shortterm and longterm impacts of covid19 macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations and financial performance including planned revenue earnings and capital investments of each reporting unit the discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 80 to 140 we used perpetual growth rates in the reporting units ranging from 05 to 10 all reporting units that have goodwill were noted to have a fair value that exceeded their carrying values except the consumer packaging reporting unit as a result we recorded a pretax noncash impairment of 13332 million or 13143 million aftertax each of our other reporting units had fair values that exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 10 each if we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis points to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each of our reporting units excluding consumer packaging would have continued to exceed its carrying value

the impairment was driven by the expected lower volumes and cash flows related to certain external sbs end markets including commercial print tobacco and plate and cup stock markets  we have experienced significant declines in demand for these products and are not showing significant recovery w e believe these declines are more systemic and our view of related growth and earnings opportunities has been diminished for the foreseeable future worldwide sbs operating rates are down and the market has taken increased levels of economic downtime in october 2020 we announced the shutdown of one of our sbs paper machines at our evadale tx mill which will result in the removal of 200000 tons of capacity at september 30 2020 following the impairment the north american corrugated consumer packaging brazil corrugated and victory packaging reporting units had 35330 million 22887 million 994 million and 411 million of goodwill respectively our longlived assets including intangible assets remain recoverable subsequent to our annual test we monitored industry 

 

economic trends until the end of our fiscal year and determined no additional testing for goodwill impairment was warranted we have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years currently we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses however we cannot predict certain market factors with certainty including the impact of covid19 and have certain risks inherent to our operations as described in item 1a “ risk factors ”  if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates particularly for our consumer packaging reporting unit for which the fair value approximates its carrying value after the impairment recognition we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material 

see item 1a “ risk factors — we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a writedown would adversely impact our operating results and shareholders’ equity ”  

accounting for income taxes

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances if any we use significant judgment in i determining whether a tax position based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination and ii measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement we do not record any benefit for the tax positions where we do not meet the “more likely than not” initial recognition threshold income tax positions must meet a “more likely than not” recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized we generally recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations resolution of the uncertain tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or materially benefit our results of operations in future periods depending upon their ultimate resolution a 1 change in our effective tax rate would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately 52 million for fiscal 2020 a 1 change in our effective tax rate used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets as recorded on the september 30 2020 consolidated balance sheet would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately 123 million for fiscal 2020

pension

the funded status of our qualified and nonqualified us and nonus pension plans increased 1375 million in fiscal 2020 our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans were over funded by 1052 million as of september 30 2020 our nonus pension plans were under funded by 535 million as of september 30 2020 our us pension plan benefit obligations were negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 primarily by a 34basis point decrease in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date the nonus pension plan obligations were negatively impacted in fiscal 2020 by a 26basis point decrease in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date a 25basis point change in the discount rate compensation level and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets factoring in our corridor as defined herein as appropriate would have had the following effect on fiscal 2020 pension expense amounts in the table in parentheses reflect additional income in millions

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk from changes in among other things interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices we aim to identify and understand these risks and then implement strategies to manage them when evaluating these strategies we evaluate the fundamentals of each market our sensitivity to movements in pricing and underlying accounting and business implications our chief executive officer and chief financial officer must approve the execution of all transactions contemplated in accordance with our financial and commodity risk management corporate policy the sensitivity analyses we present below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes we may not be successful in managing these risks

containerboard and paperboard shipments

we are exposed to market risk related to our sales of containerboard and paperboard we sell a significant portion of our mill production and converted products pursuant to contracts that provide that prices are either fixed for specified terms or provide for price adjustments based on negotiated terms including changes in specified index prices we have the capacity to annually ship approximately 119 million tons in our corrugated packaging segment and approximately 40 million tons in our consumer packaging segment although our mill system operating rates may vary from year to year due to changes in market and other factors our simple average mill system operating rates for the last three years averaged 93 a hypothetical 10 per ton decrease in the price of containerboard and paperboard throughout the year based on our capacity would decrease our sales by approximately 119 million and 40 million in our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments respectively see item 1a “ risk factors — our earnings are highly dependent on volumes ” 

energy

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas coal oil electricity diesel and wood byproducts biomass at times have fluctuated significantly in our recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and at a few mills to generate electricity used on site in our virgin fiber mills we use biomass natural gas and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates we may from time to time use commodity contracts to hedge energy exposures

we spent approximately 773 million on all energy sources in fiscal 2020 to operate our facilities natural gas and electricity each account for approximately 30 to 40 of our energy purchases depending upon pricing while the amount of energy we consume my vary from year to year due to production levels and other factors in fiscal 2021 we expect to consume approximately 88 million mmbtu of natural gas a hypothetical 10 increase in the price of energy throughout the year would increase our cost of energy by approximately 77 million based on fiscal 2020 pricing and consumption

recycled fiber

recycled fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of recycled paperboard and a portion of our containerboard we consume approximately 55 million tons of recycled fiber per year recycled fiber prices can fluctuate significantly our purchases of old corrugated containers and doublelined kraft clippings accounted for our largest recycled fiber costs and approximately 85 to 90 of our recycled fiber purchases the remaining 10 to 15 of our recycled fiber purchases consisted of a number of other grades of recycled paper the mix of recycled fiber may vary due to factors such as market demand availability and pricing a hypothetical 10 increase in recycled fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately 55 million

virgin fiber

virgin fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of a portion of our containerboard bleached paperboard and market pulp while virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices they also fluctuate particularly due to significant changes in weather such as during prolonged periods of heavy 

 

rain or drought or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations a hypothetical 10 increase in virgin fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately 137 million 

freight

inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us factors that influence our freight expense are items such as distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs primarily diesel while we experienced higher freight costs in fiscal 2019 freight costs declined in fiscal 2020 a hypothetical 10 increase for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately 161 million of which nearly oneeighth to onefifth would be the portion related to higher diesel costs based on our estimated 83 million gallons consumed annually and pricing see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

interest rates

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our shortterm and longterm debt as discussed below we may from time to time use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at september 30 2020 including the impact of our interest rate swaps if market interest rates increase an average of 100 basis points our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 13 million we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs this analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment see item 1a “ risk factors — the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ” 

derivative instruments  forward contracts

we periodically may issue and settle foreign currency denominated debt exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates on open balances at each balance sheet date from time to time we may use foreign exchange contracts to hedge these exposures with terms of generally one month based on our open foreign exchange contracts as of september 30 2020 the effect of a 1 change in exchange rates would impact other income net by approximately 3 million although these foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the foreign currency denominated debt exposures the fluctuation of these instruments may cause future cash settlement of the hedge

we periodically may also enter into interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our outstanding debt interest rate swaps are either designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of forecasted floating interest payments on variable rate debt or fair value hedges of fixed rate debt or we may elect not to treat them as accounting hedges based on our open interest rate swaps as of september 30 2020 the effect of a 1 change in interest rates would impact interest expense by approximately 6 million we may enter into swaps or forward contracts on certain commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases or sales of those commodities we currently have no active commodity forward contracts 

pension plans

our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment among other factors adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities during fiscal 2020 and 2019 the effect of a 025 decrease in the discount rate would have reduced pretax income by approximately 13 million and 10 million respectively and a 025 increase in the discount rate would have increased pretax income by 15 million and 10 million respectively similarly mepps in which we participate could experience similar circumstances which could impact our funding requirements and therefore expenses see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps ” 

 

foreign currency 

we predominately operate in markets in the us but derived 177 of our net sales in fiscal 2020 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers although we are impacted by the exchange rates of a number of currencies our largest exposures are generally to the brazilian real british pound canadian dollar euro and mexican peso in conducting our foreign operations we also make intercompany sales and receive royalties and dividends denominated in different currencies these activities expose us to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates flows of foreign currencies into and out of our operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements 

at times certain of our foreign subsidiaries have us dollardenominated external debt in these instances we may hedge the nonfunctional currency exposure with derivatives we issue intercompany loans to and receive foreign cash deposits from our foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates from deposits from time to time we may use foreignexchange hedge contracts with terms of generally less than one year to hedge these exposures although our derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the matched exposures

during fiscal 2020 and 2019 the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies that we have exposure to compared to the us dollar would have impacted our segment results by approximately 30 million and 39 million respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

during fiscal 2020 and 2019 the effect of a hypothetical 1 change in exchange rates would have impacted accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately 21 million and 31 million respectively this impact does not consider the effects of a stronger or weaker dollar on our ability to compete for export business or the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment changes in foreign exchange rates could impact the price and the demand for our products such as a strengthening dollar causes exports to become more expensive to foreign customers and business that have to pay for them in other currencies see item 1a “ risk factors — we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ”

on may 15 2016 westrock completed the distribution of the outstanding common stock par value 001 per share of ingevity corporation formerly the specialty chemicals business of westrock to westrock’s stockholders the “ separation ” as a result of the separation we disposed of our former specialty chemicals segment in its entirety and ceased to consolidate its assets liabilities and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements accordingly we presented the financial position and results of operations of our former specialty chemicals segment as discontinued operations

on april 6 2017 we completed the sale the “ hhb sale ” of our home health and beauty business a former division of our consumer packaging segment “ hhb ” we used the proceeds from the hhb sale in connection with the mps acquisition as defined below we recorded a pretax gain on sale of hhb of 1928 million in fiscal 2017 see “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — description of business ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

on june 6 2017 we completed the acquisition the “ mps acquisition ” of multi packaging solutions international limited a bermuda exempted company “ mps ” mps is reported in our consumer packaging segment see “ note 3 acquisitions and investment ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

on november 2 2018 pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger the “ merger agreement ” dated as of january 28 2018 among wrkco kapstone paper and packaging corporation “ kapstone ” westrock company formerly known as whiskey holdco inc whiskey merger sub inc and kola merger sub inc the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of kapstone through a transaction in which i whiskey merger sub inc merged with and into wrkco with wrkco surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and ii kola merger sub inc merged with and into kapstone with kapstone surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company together the “ kapstone acquisition ” as a result among other things the company became the ultimate parent of wrkco kapstone and their respective subsidiaries and the company changed its name to “westrock company” and wrkco changed its name to “wrkco inc” wrkco was the accounting acquirer in the transaction therefore the historical consolidated financial statements of wrkco for periods prior to the kapstone acquisition are also considered to be the historical financial statements of the 

 

company the company is the successor issuer to both wrkco and kapstone pursuant to rule 12g3c under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “ exchange act ” see “ note 3 acquisitions and investment ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we aligned our financial results for all periods presented to move our merchandising displays operations from our consumer packaging segment to our corrugated packaging segment and to allocate certain previously nonallocated costs and certain pension and other postretirement nonservice income expense to our reportable segments separately in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we began conducting our recycling operations primarily as a procurement function since then recycling net sales have not been recorded and the margin from these operations has reduced cost of goods sold following the realignment we report our financial results of operations in the following three reportable segments corrugated packaging which consists of our containerboard mills corrugated packaging and distribution operations as well as our merchandising displays and recycling procurement operations consumer packaging which consists of our consumer mills food and beverage and partition operations and land and development which sells real estate primarily in the charleston sc region prior to the hhb sale our consumer packaging segment included hhb

products

corrugated packaging segment

we are one of the largest integrated producers of linerboard and corrugating medium “ containerboard ” corrugated products and specialty papers including kraft papers and saturating kraft in north america measured by tons produced one of the largest producers of highgraphics preprinted linerboard measured by net sales in north america and one of the largest manufacturers of temporary promotional pointofpurchase displays in north america measured by net sales we have integrated corrugated operations in north america brazil and india we believe we are one of the largest paper recyclers in north america and our recycling operations provide substantially all of the recycled fiber to our mills as well as to third parties our brazil operations own and operate forestlands that provide virgin fiber to our brazilian mill

we operate an integrated corrugated packaging system that manufactures primarily containerboard corrugated sheets corrugated packaging and preprinted linerboard for sale to consumer and industrial products manufacturers and corrugated box manufacturers we produce a full range of highquality corrugated containers designed to protect ship store promote and display products made to our customers’ merchandising and distribution specifications we convert corrugated sheets into corrugated products ranging from onecolor protective cartons to graphically brilliant pointofpurchase packaging our corrugated container plants serve local customers and regional and large national accounts corrugated packaging is used to provide protective packaging for shipment and distribution of food paper health and beauty and other household consumer commercial and industrial products corrugated packaging may also be graphically enhanced for retail sale particularly in club store locations we provide customers with innovative packaging solutions to promote and sell their products we provide structural and graphic design engineering services and custom proprietary and standard automated packaging machines offering customers turnkey installation automation line integration and packaging solutions we have a machinery solution that creates pouches that replace singleuse plastics including bubble mailers we also distribute corrugated packaging materials and other specialty packaging products which include stretch film void fill carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes through our network of warehouses and distribution facilities to make corrugated sheet stock we feed linerboard and corrugating medium into a corrugator that flutes the medium to specified sizes glues the linerboard and fluted medium together and slits and cuts the resulting corrugated paperboard into sheets to customer specifications our containerboard mills and corrugated container operations are integrated with the majority of our containerboard production used internally by our corrugated container operations the balance is either used in trade swaps with other manufacturers or sold domestically and internationally

we design manufacture and in certain cases pack temporary displays for sale to consumer products companies and retailers these displays are used as marketing tools to support new product introductions and specific product promotions in mass merchandising stores supermarkets convenience stores home improvement stores and other retail locations we also design manufacture and in some cases preassemble permanent displays for these customers we make temporary displays primarily from corrugated paperboard unlike temporary displays permanent displays are restocked with our customers’ product therefore they are constructed primarily from metal plastic wood and other durable materials we provide contract packing services such as multiproduct promotional packing and product manipulation such as multipacks and onpacks we manufacture and distribute 

 

point of sale material utilizing litho screen and digital printing technologies we manufacture lithographic laminated packaging for sale to our customers that require packaging with high quality graphics and strength characteristics 

our recycling operations primarily procure recovered paper also known as recycled fiber from our converting facilities and from third parties such as factories warehouses commercial printers office complexes grocery and retail stores document storage facilities paper converters and other wastepaper collectors we handle a wide variety of grades of recovered paper including old corrugated containers office paper box clippings newspaper and print shop scraps we operate recycling facilities that collect sort grade and bale recovered paper and after sorting and baling we transfer it to our mills for processing or sell it principally to manufacturers of paperboard or containerboard in the united states “ us ” as well as manufacturers of tissue newsprint roofing products and insulation and to export markets we operate a nationwide fiber marketing and brokerage system that serves large regional and national accounts as well as our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills and sells scrap materials from our converting businesses and mills many of our recycling facilities are located close to our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills which helps promote the availability of supply with reduced shipping costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we began conducting our recycling operations primarily as a procurement function shifting its focus to the procurement of low cost high quality fiber for our mill system as a result we no longer record recycling net sales and the margin from these operations has reduced cost of goods sold 

sales of corrugated packaging products to external customers accounted for 642 590 and 606 of our net sales in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information

consumer packaging segment

we operate integrated virgin and recycled fiber paperboard mills and consumer packaging converting operations which convert items such as folding and beverage cartons interior partitions inserts and labels our integrated system of virgin and recycled mills produces paperboard for our converting operations and third parties we internally consume or sell to manufacturers of folding cartons and other paperboard products our coated natural kraft bleached paperboard and coated recycled paperboard and internally consume or sell to manufacturers of solid fiber interior packaging tubes and cores book covers and other paperboard products our specialty recycled paperboard the mill owned by our seven hills paperboard llc “ seven hills ” joint venture in lynchburg va manufactures gypsum paperboard liner for sale to our joint venture partner

we are one of the largest manufacturers of folding and beverage cartons in north america we believe we are the largest manufacturer of solid fiber partitions in north america measured by net sales our folding and beverage cartons are used to package items such as food paper beverages dairy products tobacco confectionery health and beauty and other household consumer commercial and industrial products primarily for retail sale our folding and beverage cartons are also used by our customers to attract consumer attention at the pointofsale we manufacture express mail packages for the overnight courier industry provide inserts and labels as well as rigid packaging and other printed packaging products such as transaction cards eg credit debit etc brochures product literature marketing materials such as booklets folders inserts cover sheets and slipcases and grower tags and plant stakes for the horticultural market for the global healthcare market we manufacture secondary packages designed to enhance patient adherence for prescription drugs as well as paperboard packaging for overthecounter and prescription drugs our customers generally use our inserts and labels to provide customer product information either inside a secondary package eg a folding carton or affixed to the outside of a primary package eg a bottle folding cartons typically protect customers’ products during shipment and distribution and employ graphics to promote them at retail we manufacture folding and beverage cartons from recycled and virgin paperboard laminated paperboard and various substrates with specialty characteristics such as grease masking and microwaveability we print coat diecut and glue the cartons to customer specifications and ship finished cartons to customers for assembling filling and sealing we employ a broad range of offset flexographic gravure backside printing coating and finishing technologies as well as iridescent holographic textured and dimensional effects to provide differentiated packaging products and support our customers with new package development innovation and design services and package testing services we manufacture and sell our solid fiber and corrugated partitions and diecut paperboard components principally to glass container manufacturers and producers of beer food wine spirits cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and to the automotive industry

sales of consumer packaging products to external customers accounted for 357 401 and 378 of our net sales in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated 

 

financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information 

land and development segment

we seek to maximize the value of the various real estate holdings we own that are concentrated in the charleston sc region we expect to complete the monetization of these holdings during fiscal 2020 sales in our land and development segment to external customers accounted for 01 09 and 16 of our net sales in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” and “ note 9 assets held for sale ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information

raw materials

the primary raw materials used by our mill operations are recycled fiber at our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills and virgin fiber from hardwoods and softwoods at our virgin containerboard and paperboard mills certain of our virgin containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate significantly while virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices they also fluctuate particularly due to significant changes in weather such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations

containerboard and paperboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations our converting operations use many different grades of containerboard and paperboard we supply substantially all of our converting operations needs for containerboard and paperboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps with other manufacturers these arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs because there are other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of containerboard and paperboard used in our converting operations we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from other suppliers in the event that we incur production disruptions for recycled or virgin containerboard and paperboard see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

energy

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas coal oil electricity and wood byproducts biomass at times has fluctuated significantly in our recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and at a few mills to generate electricity used on site in our virgin fiber mills we use natural gas biomass and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates see item 1 “ business — governmental regulation — environmental and other matters ” for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ”  see also item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk — “energy” and “derivative instruments  forward contracts” 

transportation

inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us factors that influence our freight expense are distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from our facilities to our customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs we experienced continued higher freight costs in fiscal 2019 the principal markets for our products are in north america south america europe asia and australia see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

sales and marketing

none of our top ten external customers individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019 we generally manufacture our products pursuant to customers’ orders we believe that we have good relationships with our customers see item 1a “ risk factors — we depend on certain large customers ” 

 

as a result of our vertical integration our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products during fiscal 2019 approximately twothirds of our coated natural kraft tons shipped approximately threefifths of our coated recycled paperboard tons shipped and approximately onefifth of our bleached paperboard tons shipped were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture folding and beverage cartons and approximately threefourths of our containerboard tons shipped including trade swaps and buysell transactions were delivered to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products under the terms of our seven hills joint venture arrangement our joint venture partner is required to purchase all of the qualifying gypsum paperboard liner produced by seven hills excluding the production from seven hills and from our aurora il facility which is converted into book covers and other products approximately onethird of our specialty recycled paperboard tons shipped in fiscal 2019 were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture interior partitions we have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our operations 

as a result of our broad portfolio of differentiated and sustainable paper and packaging solutions we serve over 15000 customers including over 150 customers that buy at least 1 million from each of our segments we believe that our ability to leverage our full portfolio of differentiated solutions and capabilities enables us to set ourselves apart from our competitors

we market our products primarily through our own sales force we also market a number of our products through independent sales representatives independent distributors or both we generally pay our sales personnel a combination of base salary commissions and annual bonus we pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis orders from our customers generally do not have significant lead times we discuss foreign net sales to unaffiliated customers and other nonus operations financial and other segment information in “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements

competition

we operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large well established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions including industry capacity changes global competition economic conditions in the us and abroad as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates

the industries we operate in are highly competitive and no single company dominates any of those industries our containerboard and paperboard operations compete with integrated and nonintegrated national and regional companies operating primarily in north america and to a limited extent manufacturers outside of north america our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies in the corrugated packaging and folding and beverage carton markets we compete with a significant number of national regional and local packaging suppliers in north america and abroad in the solid fiber interior packaging promotional pointofpurchase display and converted paperboard products markets we primarily compete with a smaller number of national regional and local companies offering highly specialized products 

because all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly discuss sales opportunities for new business or for renewal of existing business with customers our packaging products compete with packaging made from other materials including plastics the primary competitive factors we face include price design product innovation quality service and most recently sustainability with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences our machinery solutions represent one example of how we provide differentiated solutions and create value for our customers we believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and we obtain feedback on our performance with customer surveys among other means

the industries in which we operate have undergone consolidation within the packaging products industry larger customers with an expanded geographic presence have tended to seek suppliers that can because of their broad geographic presence efficiently and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs in addition our customers continue to demand higher quality products meeting stricter quality control requirements demand for sustainable products also impacts our industry see item 1 “ business — sustainability ” for additional information

 

see item 1a “ risk factors — we face intense competition ” and “risk factors — we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ”  

governmental regulation

health and safety regulations

our operations are subject to a broad range of foreign federal state and local laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health including the occupational safety and health act of 1970 “ osha ” and similar laws and regulations osha among other things establishes asbestos standards for the workplace although we do not use asbestos in manufacturing our products asbestos containing material “ acm ” is present in some of our facilities for those facilities where acm is present and asbestos is subject to regulation we have established procedures for properly managing acm including but not limited to employee training and work practices to maintain the acm in good condition and minimize exposure we do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

environmental and other matters

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ manufacturing processes that result in various discharges emissions and wastes these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various governmental authorities

on january 31 2013 the us environmental protection agency the “ epa ” published a set of four interrelated final rules establishing national air emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants from industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters commonly known as “ boiler mact ” boiler mact required compliance by january 31 2016 or by january 31 2017 for those mills for which we obtained a prior compliance extension all work required for our boilers to comply with the rule has been completed on july 29 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact the court vacated key portions of the rule including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers and remanded other issues to the epa for further rulemaking at this time we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our existing boiler mact strategies or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised boiler mact standards

in addition to boiler mact we are subject to several other federal state local and international environmental rules that may impact our business including the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide fine particulate matter and ozone for facilities in the us

we are involved in various administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business and we may become involved in similar matters in the future although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information we do not believe that the currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

see item 1a “ risk factors — we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs ” 

cercla and other remediation costs

we face potential liability under federal state local and international laws as a result of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment from various sites owned and operated by third parties at which companygenerated wastes have allegedly been deposited generators of hazardous substances sent to offsite disposal locations at which environmental problems exist as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are liable for response costs for the investigation and remediation of such sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “ cercla ” and analogous laws while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla liability is typically shared with other potentially 

 

responsible parties “ prps ” and costs are commonly allocated according to relative amounts of waste deposited and other factors 

in addition certain of our current or former locations are being investigated or remediated under various environmental laws including cercla based on information known to us and assumptions we do not believe that the costs of these projects will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows however the discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations including natural resources damaged at these or other sites in the future could result in additional costs

on january 26 2009 smurfitstone container corporation “ smurfitstone ” which we acquired in fiscal 2011 and certain of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code smurfitstone’s canadian subsidiaries also filed to reorganize in canada we believe that matters relating to previously identified third party prp sites and certain facilities formerly owned or operated by smurfitstone have been satisfied by claims in the smurfitstone bankruptcy proceedings however we may face additional liability for cleanup activity at sites that are not subject to the bankruptcy discharge but are not currently identified the final bankruptcy distributions were made in fiscal 2018

we believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under purchase and other agreements in connection with certain remediation sites in addition we believe that we have insurance coverage subject to applicable deductiblesretentions policy limits and other conditions for certain environmental matters however there can be no assurance that we will be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights or that if we are successful any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights will be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses we also cannot predict with certainty whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at other locations and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed current reserves in addition we cannot currently assess with certainty the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or federal state or other environmental laws regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

we estimate that we will invest approximately 15 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions and the project completion dates may change and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects and the outcomes of pending legal challenges to the boiler mact rules

climate change

certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have taken actions to address climate change the epa has issued the clean air act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit greenhouse gases “ ghg ” the epa also has promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to file an annual report of their emissions while we have facilities subject to existing ghg permitting and reporting requirements the impact of these requirements has not been material to date

additionally the epa has been working on rulemakings aimed at cutting carbon emissions from power plants on june 20 2019 the epa issued the final affordable clean energy “ ace ” rule which establishes emission guidelines for states to use in developing plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coalfired power plants the ace rule replaced a final rule issued by the epa in 2015 establishing ghg emission guidelines for existing electric utility generating units which was stayed by the us supreme court and has never gone into effect although the ace rule does not apply directly to the power generation facilities at our mills it has the potential to increase the cost of purchased electricity for our manufacturing operations and change the treatment of certain types of biomass that are currently considered carbon neutral due to uncertainties regarding the implementation of the ace rule its potential impacts on us cannot be quantified with certainty at this time

in addition to national efforts to regulate climate change some us states in which we have manufacturing operations are taking measures to reduce ghg emissions such as requiring ghg emissions reporting or developing regional capandtrade programs california has enacted a capandtrade program that took effect in 2012 and includes enforceable compliance obligations that began in 2013 in 2017 california extended the capandtrade program to 2030 we do not have any manufacturing facilities that are subject to the capandtrade 

 

requirements in california however we are continuing to monitor the implementation of this program as well as proposed mandatory ghg reduction efforts in other states the washington department of ecology issued a final rule known as the clean air rule in 2016 which applies to facilities that have average annual carbon dioxide equivalent emissions equal to or exceeding 100000 metric tonsyear energy intensive and trade exposed facilities including our tacoma wa and longview wa mills and transportation fuel importers are subject to regulation under this program various groups filed lawsuits against the washington department of ecology challenging the clean air rule and in 2018 the thurston county superior court invalidated the clean air rule the washington department of ecology subsequently filed an appeal with the state supreme court the case was argued before the supreme court on march 19 2019 and an opinion is expected before the end of 2019 implementation of the clean air rule has been stayed while the appeal is pending in june 2019 the state of new york passed the climate leadership and community protection act “ clcpa ” this legislation which becomes effective in january 2020 commits the state to reaching net zero ghg emissions with interim goals of a 40 reduction in absolute terms from 1990 levels by 2030 and an 85 reduction by 2050 our solvay ny mill could be affected by the implementation of the clcpa although we cannot currently quantify any impacts due to uncertainties regarding implementation of the law the virginia department of environmental quality has issued regulations that would link the commonwealth to the regional greenhouse gas initiative “ rggi ” which is a ninestate marketbased carbon capandtrade program although industrial facilities like our paper mills and converting facilities in virginia would be exempt from the rggi regulations electric generating units and utilities subject to the rggi carbon reduction requirements may incur increased costs that could be passed on to ratepayers like our industrial facilities in virginia the state air pollution control board approved the final rggi carbon trading regulations in april 2019 however legislative amendments made to virginia’s 2019 budget currently block the use of state funds to join rggi or any climate change compacts and to prevent using any capandtrade revenue without general assembly approval in september 2019 governor ralph northam issued executive order 43 “ eo 43 ” setting goals for virginia to generate 30 percent of its electricity from carbonfree sources by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050 eo 43 directs various state agencies including the department of environmental quality to develop a plan of action to meet these energy goals and address related issues such as energy storage energy efficiency and environmental justice 

the agreement signed in april 2016 among the us and over 170 other countries which arose out of negotiations at the united nation’s conference of parties cop21 climate summit in december 2015 the “ paris agreement ” established a framework for reducing global ghg emissions by signing the paris agreement the us made a nonbinding commitment to reduce economywide ghg emissions by 26 to 28 below 2005 levels by 2025 other countries in which we conduct business including china european union member states and india have set ghg reduction targets the paris agreement became effective in november 2016 although a party to the agreement may not provide the required oneyear notice of withdrawal until three years after the effective date in 2017 president trump announced that the us intended to withdraw from the paris agreement at this time it is not possible to determine how the paris agreement or any potential us commitments in lieu of those under the agreement may impact us industrial facilities including our domestic operations

several of our international facilities are located in countries that have already adopted ghg emissions trading schemes for example quebec has become a member of the western climate initiative which is a collaboration among california and certain canadian provinces that have joined together to create a capandtrade program to reduce ghg emissions in 2009 quebec adopted a target of reducing ghg emissions by 20 below 1990 levels by 2020 and 375 from 1990 levels by 2030 in 2011 quebec issued a final regulation establishing a regional capandtrade program that required reductions in ghg emissions from covered emitters as of january 1 2013 our mill in quebec is subject to these capandtrade requirements although the direct impact of this regulation has not been material to date compliance with this program and other similar programs may require future expenditures to meet required ghg emission reduction requirements in future years

regulation related to climate change continues to develop in the areas of the world where we conduct business we have systems in place for tracking the ghg emissions from our energyintensive facilities and we carefully monitor developments in climate related laws regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and disclosure obligations

sustainability

sustainability is an integral part of our business strategy and one of our four stated key value drivers for our customers paperbased packaging has several attributes that we believe makes it wellsuited to helping our customers provide sustainable solutions for their customers for example it is lightweight durable versatile and in 

 

many instances recyclable and made with renewable materials given the size and geographic breadth of our manufacturing operations and our history of developing innovative products and solutions we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help our customers improve their sustainability also we are helping to drive the development of the circular economy by recovering used paperbased packaging through our extensive network of recycling facilities and turning the recovered fiber into new packaging or selling it to others to use to make new products examples of our commitment to sustainability include having one of the industry’s largest certified virgin fiber procurement systems and heading an industryleading foodservice recycling initiative we have been recognized for our sustainability efforts through among other things industry award programs and inclusion in the ftse 4 good index 

patents and other intellectual property

we hold a substantial number of foreign and domestic trademarks trademark applications trade names patents patent applications and licenses relating to our business our products and our production processes our patent portfolio consists primarily of utility and design patents relating to our products and manufacturing operations it also includes exclusive rights to substantial proprietary packaging system technology in the us or other licenses obtained from a third party our brand name and logo and certain of our products and services are protected by domestic and foreign trademark rights our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights particularly those relating to our converting operations are important to our operations as a whole our intellectual property has various expiration dates

employees

at september 30 2019 we employed approximately 51100 people of which approximately 78 were located in the us and canada and 22 were located in europe south america mexico and asiapacific of the approximately 51100 employees approximately 71 were hourly and 29 were salaried approximately 46 of our hourly employees in the us and canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements “ cba” or “ cbas ” which typically have four to six year terms approximately 17 of those employees covered under cbas are operating under agreements that expire within one year and approximately 4 of those employees are working under expired contracts 

while we have experienced isolated work stoppages in the past we have been able to resolve them and we believe that working relationships with our employees are generally good while the terms of our cbas vary we believe the material terms of the agreements are customary for the industry the type of facility the classification of the employees and the geographic location covered

in october 2014 we entered into a master agreement with the united steelworkers union “ usw ” that applied to substantially all of our legacy rocktenn facilities represented by the usw at that time the agreement has a six year term and covers a number of specific items including wages medical coverage and certain other benefit programs substance abuse testing and successorship individual facilities will continue to have local agreements for subjects not covered by the master agreement and those agreements will continue to have staggered terms wage increases specified in the master agreement have been negotiated and ratified the master agreement permits us to apply its terms to usw employees who work at facilities we acquire during the term of the agreement and it now covers many former meadwestvaco kapstone and other facilities acquired westrock and the usw are currently renegotiating a successor agreement to the original master agreement the master agreement covers approximately 63 of our us facilities and approximately 8900 of our employees

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more occur could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock par value 001 per share “ common stock ” in evaluating us our business and a potential investment in our securities you should consider the following risk factors and the other information presented in this report as well as the other reports and registration statements we file from time to time with the sec the risks addressed below are not the only ones we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely impact our business

industry risks

we may experience pricing variability

our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue experiencing cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product prices for our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in the industries within which we compete and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which may be unpredictable and volatile if supply exceeds demand prices for our products could decline and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected for example we believe that the trading price of our common stock was adversely affected in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 due in part to concerns about announcements by certain of our competitors of planned additional capacity in the north american containerboard market as well as the subsequent implementation of certain of those plans

certain published indices including those published by pulp and paper week “ppw” contribute to the setting of selling prices for some of our products ppw is a limited survey that may not accurately reflect changes in market conditions for our products changes in how ppw is maintained or other indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the selling prices for these products

our earnings are highly dependent on volumes

because our operations generally have high fixed operating cost components our earnings are highly dependent on volumes which tend to fluctuate these fluctuations make it difficult to predict our financial results with any degree of certainty any failure to maintain volumes may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation

we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials energy sources and thirdparty companies to transport our goods

the costs of recycled fiber and virgin fiber the principal externally sourced raw materials for our mills are subject to pricing variability due to market and industry conditions demand for recycled fiber has fluctuated and may increase due to among other factors the addition of new recycled paper mill capacity increasing demand for products packaged in packaging produced from paper manufactured from 100 recycled fiber and the shift by 

 

manufacturers of virgin paperboard tissue newsprint and corrugated packaging to the production of products with some recycled fiber content in 2018 china implemented a ban on the importation of some categories of recyclable materials including mixed paper and set strict contamination levels for other recovered paper imports the implementation of these policies resulted in lower demand for recycled fiber in the us and lower associated costs for us in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 if china ends or changes these policies demand for recycled fiber may increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability the market price of virgin fiber varies based on availability and source of virgin fiber and the availability of virgin fiber may be impacted by among other factors weather conditions in fiscal 2019 the profitability of our us operations was adversely impacted by wet weather conditions particularly in the southern portion of the us which adversely impacted the availability of virgin fiber at some of our mills in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations fluctuate which impacts our manufacturing costs certain published indices contribute to price setting for some of our raw materials and future changes in how these indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the pricing of these raw materials 

the cost of natural gas which we use in many of our manufacturing operations including many of our mills and other energy costs including energy generated by burning natural gas fuel oil biomass and coal has at times fluctuated significantly high energy costs could increase our operating costs and make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors

we distribute our products primarily by truck and rail although we also distribute some of our products by cargo ship the reduced availability of trucks rail cars or cargo ships could adversely impact our ability to distribute our products in a timely manner high transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors 

because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the cost of raw materials energy or transportation through price increases for our products the failure to obtain raw materials energy or transportation services at reasonable market prices or the failure to pass on price increases to our customers or a reduction in the availability of raw materials energy or transportation services due to increased demand significant changes in climate or weather conditions or other factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we face intense competition

we compete in industries that are highly competitive our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies we generally compete with companies operating in north america although we have operations spanning north america south america europe asia and australia factors affecting our ability to compete include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors’ pricing strategies the introduction by our competitors of new technologies and equipment our ability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our ability to maintain the costefficiency of our facilities in addition changes within these industries including the consolidation of our competitors and our customers may impact competitive dynamics for example in 2018 international paper company completed the combination of its north american consumer packaging business with a subsidiary of graphic packaging holding company which competes with our consumer packaging segment if our competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected

our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal customer shifts away from containerboard and paperboard packaging to packaging made from other materials could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

 

operating risks 

we may be unsuccessful in making and integrating mergers acquisitions and investments and completing divestitures

we have completed a number of mergers acquisitions investments and divestitures in recent years including the combination our investment in gondi sa de cv “ grupo gondi ” the separation the hhb sale the mps acquisition and the kapstone acquisition and we may acquire invest in or sell or enter into joint ventures with additional companies we may not be able to identify suitable targets or purchasers or successfully complete suitable transactions in the future and completed transactions may not be successful these transactions create risks including but not limited to risks associated with

 



mergers acquisitions and investments may not be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers that place higher strategic value on these businesses and assets than we do for acquisitions our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of realizing them depend on the successful integration of the acquired businesses and operations with our business and operations even if we integrate these businesses and operations successfully we may not realize the full benefits we expected within the anticipated timeframe or at all and the benefits may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays

we expect the kapstone acquisition to generate runrate synergies and performance improvements of more than 200 million by the end of fiscal 2021 the success of the kapstone acquisition will depend on among other things our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities cost savings and other synergies our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of realizing these benefits will depend on us successfully integrating kapstone with our corrugated packaging business which may be more difficult complex costly and time consuming than we expect the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the kapstone acquisition may disrupt ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with employees suppliers customers and others if we are not able to successfully integrate kapstone within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected cost savings and synergies and other benefits of the kapstone acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer or cost us more to realize than expected the combined businesses may not perform as expected management’s time and energy may be diverted and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

 

our acquisition of kapstone subjects us to various risks and uncertainties 

as a result of the kapstone acquisition we are subject to various risks and uncertainties including the following 



any one or more of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may incur business disruptions

the operations at our manufacturing facilities may be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks including but not limited to risks associated with



for example in 2018 operations at our florence south carolina and panama city fl mills were interrupted by hurricanes resulting in lost mill production and the incurrence of damages supply chain disruptions and increased input costs see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information and in 2019 operations at three of our mills located in the southeastern us were temporarily idled in advance of the landfall of a hurricane

business disruptions may impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences

our success depends in part on our ability to offer differentiated solutions and we must continually develop and introduce new products and services to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments and changing customer preferences the services and products that we offer customers may not meet their needs as their business models evolve also our customers may decide to decrease their use of our products use alternative 

 

materials for their product packaging or forego the packaging of certain products entirely regulatory developments can also significantly alter the market for our products for example a move to electronic distribution of disclaimers and other paperless regimes could adversely impact our healthcare inserts and labels businesses 

consumer preferences for products and packaging formats are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience and health environmental and social concerns and perceptions for example changing consumer dietary habits and preferences have slowed the sales growth for certain of the food and beverage products we package also there is an increasing focus among consumers to ensure that products delivered through ecommerce are packaged efficiently for instance amazon has begun requiring that all items sold through amazon that are larger than a specified size be designed and certified as readytoship our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences

our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated

we regularly make capital expenditures and many of our capital projects are complex costly andor implemented over an extended period of time for example in fiscal 2019 we completed strategic capital projects at our porto feliz corrugated box plant in the brazilian state of sao paulo our cottonton alabama and covington virginia mills and we continue to invest in strategic projects at our florence south carolina and tres barras brazil mills our capital expenditures for these and other capital projects could be higher than we anticipated we may experience unanticipated business disruptions andor we may not achieve the desired benefits from the capital projects any of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in addition disputes between us and contractors who are involved with implementing capital projects could lead to timeconsuming and costly litigation

we are exposed to risks related to international sales and operations

we derived 182 of our net sales in fiscal 2019 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected by risks related to the countries outside the us in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil china mexico and india where we maintain operations directly or through a joint venture are exposed to varying degrees of economic political and social instability we are exposed to risks of operating in those countries as well as others including but not limited to risks associated with



any one or more of these risks could adversely affect our international operations and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

 

we cannot operate our joint ventures solely for our benefit which subjects us to risks 

we have invested in joint ventures and may form additional joint ventures in the future our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks including but not limited to risks associated with



we may produce faulty or contaminated products due to failures in quality control measures and systems

our failure to produce products that meet safety and quality standards could result in adverse effects on consumer health litigation exposure loss of market share and adverse financial impacts among other potential consequences and we may incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action up to and including recalling products from end consumers and to reimburse customers andor end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of these failures our actions or omissions with respect to product safety and quality could lead to regulatory investigations enforcement actions andor prosecutions and result in adverse publicity which may damage our reputation any of these results could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we provide guarantees or representations in certain of our contracts that our products are produced in accordance with customer specifications if the product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated the manufacturer of the product may allege that the packaging we provided caused the fault or contamination even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications if our packaging fails to function properly or to preserve the integrity of its contents we could face liability from our customers and third parties for bodily injury or other damages these liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we depend on certain large customers

our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments have large customers the loss of which could adversely affect each segment’s sales and depending on the significance of the loss our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in particular because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly bid for new business or for the renewal of existing business the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may adversely impact our financial results

we are subject to cybersecurity risks including related to customer employee vendor or other company data

we use information technologies to securely manage operations and various business functions we rely on various technologies some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including reporting on our business and interacting with customers vendors and employees in addition we collect and store data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls our systems are subject to repeated attempts by third parties to access information or to disrupt our systems despite our security design and controls and those of our thirdparty providers we may become subject to system damage disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes including cyberattacks breaches employee error or 

 

malfeasance power outages telecommunication or utility failures systems failures service providers natural disasters or other catastrophic events these vulnerabilities may remain undetected for an extended period of time we may face other challenges and risks as we upgrade and standardize our information technology systems as part of our integration of acquired businesses and operations we maintain contingency plans to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events however these events could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data and depending on their nature and scope could lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and exposure to liability such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions including reputational damage and legal claims or proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters

a significant number of our union employees are governed by cbas expired contracts are in the process of renegotiation and others expire within one year for example we are negotiating a successor agreement to the original master agreement with the usw which is scheduled to expire october 2020 we may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts without work stoppages or labor difficulties or renegotiate them on favorable terms we have experienced work stoppages in the past and may experience them in the future if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected in addition our businesses rely on vendors suppliers and other third parties that have union employees strikes or work stoppages affecting these vendors suppliers and other third parties could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel including key personnel

our success depends on our ability to attract motivate train and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers the increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire if we fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel or if we experience excessive turnover we may experience declining sales manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies increased recruiting training and relocation costs and other difficulties and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted

we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively the loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted in particular our failure to identify candidates with the leadership skills to manage our increasingly complex organization and our failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key executives could hinder our strategic planning and execution

financial risks

we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change

our businesses may be adversely affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control including but not limited to



 



for example we may experience lower demand for our products and the products of our customers that utilize our products if economic conditions in the us and globally including in europe brazil and mexico deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates lower family income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment or lower consumer spending in addition changes in trade policy including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs could impact demand for our products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments macroeconomic challenges may also lead to changes in tax laws or tax rates that may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities we are not able to predict with certainty economic and financial market conditions and social and political change and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected by adverse market conditions and social and political change

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business

at september 30 2019 we had 101 billion of debt outstanding the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences including



 

certain of our variable rate debt uses the london interbank offered rate “ libor ” as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate the uk financial conduct authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 in addition other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation reform or replacement may negatively impact the cost of our variable rate debt 

we are subject to agreements that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants and may restrict us from among other things disposing of assets and incurring additional indebtedness these restrictions may limit our flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures

credit rating downgrades could increase our borrowing costs or otherwise adversely affect us

some of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from rating agencies our credit ratings could change based on among other things our results of operations and financial condition credit ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a “watch list” for a possible downgrade or assigned a “negative outlook” actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could increase our borrowing costs which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our 

 

common stock if a downgrade were to occur or a negative outlook were to be assigned it could impact our ability to access the capital markets to raise debt andor increase the associated costs in addition while our credit ratings are important to us we may take actions and otherwise operate our business in a manner that adversely affects our credit ratings 

we sell shortterm receivables from certain customer trade accounts on a revolving basis any downgrade of the credit rating or deterioration of the financial condition of these customers may make it more costly or difficult for us to engage in these activities which could adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity

we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a writedown would adversely impact our operating results and shareholders’ equity 

at september 30 2019 the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was 113 billion we review the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when impairment indicators exist the impairment test requires us to analyze a number of factors and make estimates that require judgment in fiscal 2019 we identified our consumer packaging and victory packaging reporting units as having fair values that exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows changes in our business strategy and external market conditions among other factors could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net income if a significant write down were required the charge could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and shareholders’ equity and could impact the trading price of our common stock see “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — goodwill and longlived assets ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

our pension plans will likely require additional cash contributions

we expect to continue to make contributions to our pension plans in the coming years in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate and meet the requirements of the pension act and other regulations at september 30 2019 our pensions were underfunded by approximately 01 billion the actual required amounts and timing of future cash contributions will be highly sensitive to changes in the applicable discount rates and returns on plan assets and could also be impacted by future changes in the laws and regulations applicable to plan funding our pension plan assets are primarily made up of fixed income equity and alternative investments fluctuations in the market performance of these assets and changes in interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension plan costs in future periods changes in assumptions regarding expected longterm rate of return on plan assets our discount rate expected compensation levels or mortality could also increase or decrease pension costs these changes along with future turmoil in financial and capital markets may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring

we have previously restructured portions of our operations and likely will engage in future restructuring initiatives because we are not able to predict with certainty market conditions including changes in the supply and demand for our products the loss of large customers the selling prices for our products or our manufacturing costs we may not be able to predict with certainty the appropriate time to undertake restructurings the cash and noncash costs associated with these activities vary depending on the type of facility impacted with the noncash cost of a mill closure generally being more significant than that of a converting facility due to the higher level of investment restructuring activities may divert the attention of management disrupt our operations and fail to achieve the intended cost and operations benefits

we may utilize our cash flow or incur additional indebtedness to satisfy certain payment obligations related to or otherwise increase our investment in grupo gondi

in connection with our investment in the joint venture with grupo gondi we entered into an option agreement pursuant to which we and certain shareholders of grupo gondi agreed to future put and call options with respect to the equity interests in the joint venture held by each party we own 323 of the joint venture pursuant to the option agreement our joint venture partners may exercise a right on april 1 2020 to sell us up to 24 of the equity interest in grupo gondi at fair market value and between october 1 2020 and april 1 2021 we may exercise a right to purchase an additional 187 equity interest in grupo gondi from our joint venture partners at a predetermined purchase price if we exercise our right to purchase the additional 187 equity interest our partners may elect to 

 

sell us their remaining interest at fair market value at that time or a portion thereof in the future in accordance with the terms of the option agreement in addition in the event that we do not exercise our right to purchase the additional 187 equity interest our joint venture partners may call our 323 equity interest at a predetermined price between october 1 2021 and april 1 2022 these arrangements or other arrangements pursuant to which we increase our ownership in grupo gondi may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to satisfy our payment or investment obligations which may reduce the amount of funds available for our operations capital expenditures and corporate development activities also we may be required to incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities in order to satisfy our payment or investment obligations 

we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps

we participate in several mepps our contributions to any particular mepp may increase based on the declining funded status of a mepp and legal requirements such as those of the pension act which require substantially underfunded mepps to implement a funding improvement plan “ fip ” or a rehabilitation plan “ rp ” to improve their funded status the funded status of a mepp may be impacted by among other items a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans the inability or failure of companies withdrawing from the plan to pay their withdrawal liability low interest rates changes in actuarial assumptions andor lower than expected returns on pension fund assets

we believe that certain of the mepps in which we participate or have participated including piumpf have material unfunded vested benefits in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from piumpf and the central sates southeast and southwest areas pension fund “ central states ” and recorded aggregate withdrawal liabilities of 1842 million nearly all of which was for piumpf which includes an estimate of our portion of piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency we may withdraw from other mepps in the future

in september 2019 we received a demand from piumpf asserting that we owe 1703 million on an undiscounted basis approximately 07 million per month for the next 20 years with respect to our withdrawal liability the demand did not address any assertion of liability for piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency we expect to begin making monthly payments for these withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2020

the impact of increased contributions future funding obligations or future withdrawal liabilities may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including a summary of the demand letters we received from piumpf

legal and regulatory risks

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign laws regulations and other requirements including those relating to the environment product safety competition corruption occupational health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax and health care these laws regulations and other requirements may change or be applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our equipment andor operations subject us to enforcement risk expose us to reputational harm or impose on or require us to incur additional costs including substantial compliance costs which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental health and safety laws and regulations our environmental expenditures include those related to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater including situations where we have been identified as a prp because environmental health and safety regulations are constantly evolving we will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws and our compliance costs could increase materially future compliance with existing and new laws and requirements may disrupt our business operations and require significant expenditures and our existing reserves for specific matters may not be adequate to cover future costs in particular our manufacturing operations consume significant amounts of energy and we may in the future incur additional or increased capital operating and other expenditures from changes due to new or increased climaterelated and other environmental regulations we could also incur substantial liabilities 

 

including fines or sanctions enforcement actions natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury under environmental and common laws 

the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 and local antibribery laws including those in brazil china mexico india and the united kingdom where we maintain operations directly or through a joint venture prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of influencing official decisions our internal control policies and procedures or those of our vendors may not adequately protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed or alleged to have been committed by our employees agents or vendors any such violations could lead to civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties andor could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility additionally changing privacy laws in the united states including the california consumer privacy act which will become effective in january 2020 europe where the general data protection regulation became effective in 2018 and elsewhere have created new individual privacy rights imposed increased obligations on companies handling personal data and increased potential exposure to fines and penalties

acquisitions and investments 

during fiscal 2019 and 2018 we completed acquisitions that expanded our product and geographic scope allowed us to increase our integration levels and impacted our comparative financials we expect to continue to evaluate similar potential acquisitions in the future although the size of individual acquisitions may vary below we summarize certain of these acquisitions

on november 2 2018 we completed the kapstone acquisition kapstone is a leading north american producer and distributor of containerboard corrugated products and specialty papers including liner and medium containerboard kraft papers and saturating kraft kapstone also owns victory packaging a packaging solutions 

 

distribution company with facilities in the us canada and mexico we have included the financial results of kapstone in our corrugated packaging segment since the date of the acquisition

business

 



 

 

in fiscal 2019 we continued to pursue our strategy of offering differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win we successfully executed this strategy in fiscal 2019 in a rapidly changing cost and price environment net sales of 182890 million for fiscal 2019 increased 20039 million or 123 compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was primarily due to the kapstone acquisition and higher selling pricemix in our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments these increases were partially offset by the absence of recycling net sales in fiscal 2019 as a result of conducting the operations primarily as a procurement function beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 lower volumes unfavorable foreign currency impacts across our segments compared to the prior year and decreased land and development net sales

 

segment income increased 826 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to increased corrugated packaging segment income that was partially offset by lower consumer packaging and land and development segment income the impact of the contribution from the acquired kapstone operations higher selling pricemix across our segments and productivity improvements was largely offset by lower volumes across our segments economic downtime cost inflation increased maintenance and scheduled strategic outage expense including projects at our mahrt al and covington va mills and lower land and development segment income due to the winddown of sales with respect to segment income we experienced higher levels of cost inflation in both our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments during fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 that were partially offset by recovered fiber deflation the primary inflationary items were virgin fiber freight energy and wage and other costs

 

we generated 23102 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared to 19312 million in fiscal 2018 we remained committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy during fiscal 2019 by investing 13691 million in capital expenditures deployed 33742 million to strategic acquisitions excluding the 

 

assumption of debt while returning 4679 million in dividends and 886 million to our stockholders in share repurchases in the nine months following december 2018 the quarter that included the kapstone acquisition we reduced total debt 7574 million we believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest to sustain and improve our operating performance in fiscal 2020 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 11 billion see “ liquidity and capital resources ” for more information 

a detailed review of our fiscal 2019 and 2018 performance appears below under “ results of operations consolidated ” and “ results of operations — segment data ”

for fiscal 2020 we expect to generate net sales of between 180 billion and 185 billion our expectations reflect the anticipated impact of the flow through of previously published price declines in north america containerboard and kraft paper index pricing as well as the full year impact of market pricing declines that we have experienced in export containerboard and kraft paper and market pulp we expect that these declines will be partially offset by the impact of an additional month of kapstone sales and growth in our corrugated box volumes in north america and brazil as well as increased volumes in our consumer packaging segment

we expect our earnings in fiscal 2020 to be impacted by the pricing declines noted above as well as cost inflation related to wages benefits and other noncommodity categories we expect to experience commodity cost deflation particularly related to recycled fiber similar to past years we expect that slightly more of our earnings will be generated in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half of the fiscal year due to seasonality the timing of scheduled mill maintenance outages and our strategic capital projects

in fiscal 2019 we announced plans to reconfigure our north charleston sc mill the project which we expect to begin in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 is expected to reduce our linerboard capacity by approximately 288000 tons and our annual costs by approximately 40 million including a workforce reduction over a fivemonth period

we expect to invest approximately 11 billion in capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 including approximately 275 million for our strategic capital projects at our florence sc and tres barras brazil mills we expect to start up the project at our florence sc mill in the spring of 2020 and to incur maintenance downtime during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 in connection with this project

 

 

results of operations consolidated 

the following table summarizes our consolidated results for the two years ended september 30 2019

 



 

nongaap financial measures 

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “ gaap ” however we have included financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our gaap results the nongaap financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures of other companies

we use the nongaap financial measures “adjusted net income” and “adjusted earnings per diluted share” management believes these nongaap financial measures provide our board of directors investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because the measures exclude restructuring and other costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating results of the business we and our board of directors use this information to evaluate our performance relative to other periods we believe that the most directly comparable gaap measures to adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share are net income attributable to common stockholders and earnings per diluted share respectively 

diluted earnings per share were 333 in fiscal 2019 compared to 734 in fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per diluted share were 398 and 409 in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively

set forth below is a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure adjusted earnings per diluted share to earnings per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measure in dollars per share for the periods indicated

 

 



 



 

the gaap results in the tables below for pretax tax and net of tax are equivalent to the line items “income before income taxes” “income tax expense benefit” and “consolidated net income” respectively as reported on the statements of income set forth below are reconciliations of adjusted net income to the most directly comparable gaap measure net income attributable to common stockholders represented in the table below as the gaap results for consolidated net income ie net of tax plus noncontrolling interests for the periods indicated in millions

 



 

 



 



 



 

we discuss certain of these charges in more detail in “ note 4 restructuring and other costs ” “ note 5 retirement plans ” and “ note 6 income taxes ”

net sales unaffiliated customers 

net sales in fiscal 2019 increased 20039 million or 123 compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was primarily attributable to the kapstone acquisition and higher selling pricemix in our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments these increases were partially offset by the absence of recycling net sales in fiscal 2019 as a result of conducting the operations primarily as a procurement function beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency impacts across our segments compared to the prior year the change in net sales by segment is outlined below in “ results of operations — segment data ”

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold increased to 145400 million in fiscal 2019 compared to 129231 million in fiscal 2018 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 795 in fiscal 2019 compared to 794 in fiscal 2018 the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to increased net sales associated with the impact of acquisitions primarily the kapstone acquisition higher levels of cost inflation and other items these factors were partially offset by lower recovered fiber costs and productivity improvements we discuss these items in greater detail below in fiscal 2019 we received 1800 million of insurance proceeds related to hurricane michael primarily associated with our panama city fl mill that were recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold see “ hurricane michael ” below for additional information we discuss these items in greater detail below in “ results of operations — segment data ” 

selling general and administrative excluding intangible amortization 

selling general and administrative expenses “ sga ” excluding intangible amortization increased 1686 million to 17152 million in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to the kapstone acquisition sga excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of net sales declined in fiscal 2019 to 94 from 95 in fiscal 2018

 

selling general and administrative intangible amortization 

sga intangible amortization was 4002 million and 2966 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively the increase in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the kapstone acquisition 

gain loss on disposal of assets 

the gain on disposal of assets in fiscal 2019 was 412 million and the loss on disposal of assets in fiscal 2018 was 101 million the gain on disposal of assets in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the 485 million gain on sale of our former atlanta beverage facility recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 

multiemployer pension withdrawal income expense 

in the fiscal 2019 we recorded a 63 million reduction to a previously recorded mepp withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from piumpf and central states and recorded aggregate estimated withdrawal liabilities of 1842 million which includes an estimate of our portion of piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency since these withdrawal liabilities assume payment over 20 years the liabilities were discounted at a credit adjusted riskfree rate and therefore we will accrete the liability over time with a charge to interest expense see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including the receipt of demand letters from piumpf see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps ”

land and development impairments 

in fiscal 2019 we recorded 130 million of pretax noncash impairments of certain mineral rights following the termination of a third party leasing relationship in fiscal 2018 we recorded 319 million of pretax noncash impairments of certain mineral rights and real estate the 236 million impairment of mineral rights in fiscal 2018 was driven by the nonrenewal of a lease and associated with declining oil and gas prices and the other 83 million was recorded to writedown the carrying value of certain real estate projects where the projected sales proceeds were less than the carrying value these charges are not reflected in segment income 

restructuring and other costs 

we recorded aggregate pretax restructuring and other costs of 1737 million and 1054 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively we generally expect the integration of a closed facility’s assets and production with other facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility costs recorded in each period are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with each restructuring acquisition divestiture or integration vary see “ note 4 restructuring and other costs ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including a description of the type of costs incurred we have restructured portions of our operations from time to time and it is likely that we will engage in additional restructuring opportunities in the future see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring ” 

interest expense net 

interest expense net was 4313 million and 2938 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively interest expense net in fiscal 2019 increased primarily due to debt incurred as a result of the kapstone acquisition and higher interest rates interest expense net in fiscal 2019 and 2018 was reduced by 278 million and 310 million respectively related to the amortization of the fair value of debt steppedup in purchase accounting see item 1a “ risk factors — the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ” 

pension and other postretirement nonservice income 

pension and other postretirement nonservice income was 742 million and 953 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively subsequent to the adoption of asu 201707 as hereinafter defined we began presenting the nonservice components of our pension and other postretirement income expense separately from the service 

 

cost components and outside the subtotal of operating profit the decrease in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the decline in plan asset balances used to determine the expected return on plan assets 

other income net 

other income net was 24 million and 127 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively other income net in fiscal 2018 included a 123 million gain on the sale of our solid waste management brokerage services business 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded income tax expense of 2768 million for fiscal 2019 at an effective tax rate of 242 compared to an income tax benefit of 8745 million at an effective tax rate benefit of 845 in fiscal 2018 including a 11288 million provisional benefit from the tax act

 

the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to i the inclusion of state taxes ii income derived from certain foreign jurisdictions subject to higher tax rates iii the exclusion of tax benefits related to losses recorded by certain foreign operations iv the limitation of certain transaction costs and v the increase of deferred tax liabilities in certain state jurisdictions partially offset by vi the inclusion of tax benefits related to sharebased compensation and state tax law changes vii research and development tax credits and viii an adjustment of the valuation allowance against net operating losses of foreign subsidiaries

 

the effective tax rate benefit for fiscal 2018 was lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to i the provisional amounts related to the enactment of the tax act ii favorable tax items such as the domestic production deduction tax benefit of sharebased compensation and cash tax planning that resulted in reduced deferred tax liabilities iii the true up of certain deferred taxes and foreign tax returns and iv a change in valuation allowance partially offset by v the inclusion of state taxes and vi the exclusion of tax benefits related to losses recorded by certain foreign operations

see “ note 6 income taxes ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including the impact of the tax act

 

hurricane michael 

 

in october 2018 our containerboard and pulp mill located in panama city fl sustained extensive damage from hurricane michael we shut down the mill’s operations in advance of the hurricane’s landfall repair work was completed during june 2019 on the two paper machines and related infrastructure and these paper machines are now producing at normal production levels other repairs at the mill are continuing and all remaining repair work is expected to be completed during fiscal 2020 and 2021 while we are still identifying the full cost associated with the damage from hurricane michael we anticipate the total of our property damage and business interruption claim will exceed 200 million

 

in fiscal 2019 we received 1800 million of insurance proceeds net of our 15 million deductible that were recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold in our corrugated packaging segment related primarily to the panama city mill the insurance proceeds consisted of 553 million for business interruption recoveries and 1247 million for direct costs and property damage our consolidated statements of cash flow in fiscal 2019 included 1545 million in net cash provided by operating activities and 255 million net cash used for investing activities we expect to recover the majority of the additional amount of direct costs and lost production and sales in future periods through insurance reimbursements

north american corrugated packaging shipments

corrugated packaging shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent which includes external and intersegment tons shipped from our corrugated packaging mills plus corrugated packaging container shipments converted from billion square feet “ bsf ” to tons we have presented the corrugated packaging shipments in two groups north american and brazil  india because we believe investors potential investors securities analysts and 

 

others find this breakout useful when evaluating our operating performance we have included the impact of the kapstone acquisition beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the shipment data table excludes merchandising displays since there is not a common unit of measure the table below reflects shipments in thousands of tons bsf and millions of square feet “ mmsf ”

corrugated packaging segment 

 



 



net sales aggregate — corrugated packaging segment

net sales before intersegment elimination for the corrugated packaging segment increased 21237 million in the fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 the increase in net sales was primarily due to 28515 million from acquisitions notably the kapstone acquisition and 2035 million from higher corrugated selling pricemix as we had higher selling prices for domestic containerboard and corrugated containers that were partially offset by declining export prices these increases were partially offset by the absence of 4616 million of recycling net sales in fiscal 2019 as a result of conducting the operations primarily as a procurement function beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 4177 million of lower volumes as lower containerboard volumes were partially offset by increased corrugated container shipments and 654 million related to the impact of unfavorable foreign currency 

segment income — corrugated packaging segment

segment income attributable to the corrugated packaging segment in fiscal 2019 increased 1596 million compared to fiscal 2018 primarily due to a 2310 million of contribution from the acquired kapstone operations before an estimated 231 million of economic downtime and net of a 247 million acquisition inventory stepup charge an estimated 1228 million of productivity improvements and 1188 million of higher corrugated selling pricemix these increases were partially offset by 1265 million of lower volumes unfavorable cost inflation of 909 million an estimated 664 million of economic downtime including kapstone 124 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts and other costs the net impact of cost inflation was unfavorable compared to the prior year as lower recovered fiber costs were more than offset by higher wage and other costs virgin fiber costs freight costs energy costs and chemical costs in fiscal 2019 corrugated packaging segment income included 113 million for a receivable established for the recovery of indirect taxes in brazil see “ note 18 commitments and contingencies — indirect tax claim ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information fiscal 2018 results were negatively affected by an estimated 207 million due to the impact of winter weather and 190 million of startup issues following a major maintenance outage at our panama city fl and tacoma wa mills fiscal 2019 results included an estimated 77 million and 59 million of expense due to the impact of hurricane dorian and startup issues following a major maintenance outage respectively the full year impact of hurricane michael net of recoveries on corrugated packaging segment income was not significant

consumer packaging segment 

 



 



net sales aggregate — consumer packaging segment

net sales before intersegment eliminations for the consumer packaging segment decreased 115 million in fiscal 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to 1283 million of higher selling pricemix and 320 million from acquisitions which were more than offset by 880 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts and 837 million of lower volumes lower volumes were primarily driven by a decline in mill volumes that were partially offset by a 37 increase in north american food and beverage tons shipped

segment income — consumer packaging segment

 

segment income attributable to the consumer packaging segment in fiscal 2019 decreased 570 million compared to the prior year segment income in the period was reduced by an estimated 1125 million due to the net impact of cost inflation compared to the prior year an estimated 351 million of increased maintenance and scheduled strategic outage expense including the projects at the mahrt al and covington va mills 445 million due to the impact of lower volumes 145 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts 56 million of higher

land and development segment 

 



 



net sales aggregate — land and development segment

net sales for the land and development segment in fiscal 2019 and 2018 were 234 million and 1424 million respectively the decrease in fiscal 2019 was due to the winddown of sales we include the remainder of the real estate holdings in assets held for sale because we have met the held for sale criteria

segment income loss — land and development segment

segment income attributable to the land and development segment was 25 million and 225 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively the pretax noncash impairments of certain mineral rights and real estate discussed above under the caption “ land and development impairments ” are not included in segment income

liquidity and capital resources

we fund our working capital requirements capital expenditures mergers acquisitions and investments restructuring activities dividends and stock repurchases from net cash provided by operating activities borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from our ar sales agreement as hereinafter defined proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment removed from service and proceeds received in connection with the issuance of debt and equity securities see “ note 13 debt ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information funding for our domestic operations in the foreseeable future is expected to come from sources of liquidity within our domestic operations including cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our credit facilities as such our foreign cash and cash equivalents are not expected to be a key source of liquidity to our domestic operations 

 

at september 30 2019 we had approximately 29 billion of availability under our committed credit facilities primarily under our revolving credit facility the majority of which matures on july 1 2022 this liquidity may be used to provide for ongoing working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes including acquisitions dividends and stock repurchases 

certain restrictive covenants govern our maximum availability under the credit facilities we test and report our compliance with these covenants as required and we were in compliance with all of these covenants at september 30 2019 at september 30 2019 we had 1298 million of outstanding letters of credit not drawn upon 

cash and cash equivalents were 1516 million at september 30 2019 and 6368 million at september 30 2018 we used a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents on hand at september 30 2018 in connection with the closing of the kapstone acquisition primarily all of the cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2019 were held outside of the us at september 30 2019 total debt was 100634 million 5611 million of which was current at september 30 2018 total debt was 64152 million 7407 million of which was current the increase in debt was primarily related to the kapstone acquisition

cash flow activity 

 



net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019 increased 3790 million from fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher cash earnings and a 3403 million net decrease in the use of working capital compared to the prior year as a result of the retrospective adoption of asu 201615 and asu 201618 each as hereinafter defined as discussed in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2018 was reduced by 4897 million and cash provided by investing activities increased 4838 million primarily for the change in classification of proceeds received for beneficial interests obtained for transferring trade receivables in securitization transactions 

net cash used for investing activities of 45796 million in fiscal 2019 consisted primarily of 33742 million for cash paid for the purchase of businesses net of cash acquired excluding the assumption of debt primarily related to the kapstone acquisition and 13691 million for capital expenditures that were partially offset by 1191 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment primarily related to the sale of our atlanta beverage facility 332 million of proceeds from corporate owned life insurance benefits and 255 million of proceeds from property plant and equipment insurance proceeds related to the panama city fl mill net cash used for investing activities of 8151 million in fiscal 2018 consisted primarily of 9999 million for capital expenditures 2399 million for cash paid for the purchase of businesses net of cash acquired primarily related to the plymouth acquisition and the schlüter acquisition and 1080 million for an investment in grupo gondi these investments were partially offset by 4616 million of cash receipts on sold trade receivables as a result of the adoption of asu 201615 240 million of proceeds from the sale of certain affiliates as well as our solid waste management brokerage services business and 233 million of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment 

in fiscal 2019 net cash provided by financing activities of 17802 million consisted primarily of a net increase in debt of 23146 million primarily related to the kapstone acquisition and partially offset by cash dividends paid to stockholders of 4679 million and purchases of common stock of 886 million in fiscal 2018 net cash used for financing activities of 7551 million consisted primarily of cash dividends paid to stockholders of 4409 million and purchases of common stock of 1951 million and net repayments of debt of 1201 million 

our capital expenditures aggregated 13691 million in fiscal 2019 we expect fiscal 2020 capital expenditures to be approximately 11 billion including approximately 275 million for our strategic capital projects at our florence sc and tres barras brazil mills we expect to start up the project at our florence mill in the spring of 2020 and the tres barras project in the first half of calendar 2021 with the completion of certain of our strategic capital projects in fiscal 2019 and 2020 we expect to transition to our longrange capital expenditure run rate of 

 

approximately 900 million to 10 billion a year in fiscal 2021 we generally expect our base capital expenditures to be roughly half invested in maintenance and half invested in high return generating projects however it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions may change project completion dates may change or we may decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify or changes in market conditions or to comply with environmental or other regulatory changes 

we estimate that we will invest approximately 15 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance we were obligated to purchase approximately 623 million of fixed assets at september 30 2019 for various capital projects see item 1a “ risk factors — our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated ” 

at september 30 2019 the us federal state and foreign net operating losses and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately 83 million in future potential reductions of us federal state and foreign cash taxes based on our current projections we expect to utilize the remaining us federal net operating losses over the next two years foreign and state net operating losses and credits will be used over a longer period of time it is possible that our utilization of these net operating losses and credits may change due to changes in taxable income tax laws or tax rates capital expenditures or other factors including the estimated impact of book and tax differences subject to changes in tax laws we expect our cash tax rate to move closer to our income tax rate in fiscal 2020 2021 and 2022

during fiscal 2019 and 2018 we made contributions of 250 million and 377 million respectively to our us and nonus pension plans based on current facts and assumptions we expect to contribute approximately 27 million to our us and nonus pension plans in fiscal 2020 we have made contributions and expect to continue to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the pension act and other regulations the net underfunded status of our us and nonus pension plans at september 30 2019 was 858 million based on current assumptions including future interest rates we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our us and nonus pension plans will be in the range of approximately 24 million to 28 million annually in fiscal 2021 through 2024 see “ note 5 retirement plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also item 1a “ risk factors —our pension plans will likely require additional cash contributions ” 

in the normal course of business we evaluate our potential exposure to mepps including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from two plans and recorded an aggregate estimated withdrawal liability of 1842 million nearly all of which was for piumpf in september 2019 we received a demand from piumpf asserting that we owe 1703 million on an undiscounted basis approximately 07 million per month for the next 20 years with respect to our withdrawal liability the demand did not address any assertion of liability for piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency in october 2019 we received two additional demand letters from piumpf related to a subsidiary asserting that we owe 23 million on an undiscounted basis to be paid over 20 years with respect to the subsidiary’s withdrawal liability and 20 million for its accumulated funding deficiency we are evaluating each of these demands we expect to challenge the accumulated funding deficiency we expect to begin making monthly payments for these withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2020 see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps ” 

in november 2019 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0465 per share representing a 22 increase from the prior 0455 per share quarterly dividend and an annual dividend of 186 per share during fiscal 2019 and 2018 we paid an annual dividend of 182 per share and 172 per share respectively 

in july 2015 our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 400 million shares of our common stock representing approximately 15 of our outstanding common stock as of july 1 2015 shares of our common stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions the timing manner price and amount of repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on factors including the market price of our common stock general economic and market conditions and applicable legal requirements the repurchase program may be commenced suspended or discontinued at any time in fiscal 2019 we repurchased approximately 21 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 886 million in fiscal 2018 we repurchased approximately 34 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost 

 

of 1951 million as of september 30 2019 we had approximately 191 million shares of common stock available for repurchase under the program 

we anticipate that we will be able to fund our capital expenditures interest payments dividends and stock repurchases pension payments working capital needs note repurchases restructuring activities repayments of current portion of longterm debt and other corporate actions for the foreseeable future from cash generated from operations borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from our ar sales agreement proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities or other additional longterm debt financing including new or amended facilities in addition we continually review our capital structure and conditions in the private and public debt markets in order to optimize our mix of indebtedness in connection with these reviews we may seek to refinance existing indebtedness to extend maturities reduce borrowing costs or otherwise improve the terms and composition of our indebtedness

contractual obligations

we summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at september 30 2019 and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table certain amounts in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans because these estimates and assumptions are subjective the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those presented in the table

 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 





in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations presented in the table above we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business these contracts however are subject to change based on our business decisions

expenditures for environmental compliance

see item 1 “ business — governmental regulation — environmental and other matters ” “ business — governmental regulation — cercla and other remediation costs ” and “ business — governmental regulation — climate change ” for a discussion of our expenditures for environmental compliance

critical accounting policies and estimates

we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities reported certain significant accounting policies are described in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” 

these critical accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require some of management’s most subjective and complex judgments the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts circumstances and assumptions that in management’s judgment could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and accordingly could cause our future reported financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates

goodwill

we review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value we determine recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value including goodwill of that reporting unit we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method or as appropriate a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the guideline public company method our discounted cash flow analysis is based on the sum of two components the present value of our projected cash flows and the present value of a terminal value the cash flow estimates are derived from our current forecast and our longterm forecasts prepared for each reporting unit considering historical results and anticipated future performance and capital expenditures and require considerable judgment the discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows are derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis utilizing a beta derived from peer companies in addition we give consideration in the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital for equity risks including size risk industry risk and country specific risk as appropriate for each of our reporting units the guideline public company method involves comparing the reporting unit to similar companies whose stock is freely traded on an organized exchange the fair values determined by the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods were weighted to arrive at the concluded fair value of the reporting unit however in instances where comparisons to our peers was less meaningful no weight was placed on the guideline public company method to arrive at the concluded fair value of the reporting unit

estimating the fair value of the reporting unit involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs capital expenditures industry economic factors and future business strategy the variability of the factors that management uses to perform the goodwill impairment test depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and cash flows including anticipated changes in revenues and costs and synergies and productivity improvements resulting from the acquisitions capital expenditures and continuous improvement projects these factors are interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation accordingly our accounting estimates may materially change from period to period due to changing market factors if we had used other 

 

assumptions and estimates or if conditions change in future periods our operating results could be materially impacted any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these reporting units and their prospects such as changes in our strategy or products the loss of key customers regulatory changes or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a change in the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2019 we tested our goodwill for potential impairment on an interim basis due to changing market conditions including the impact on the trading price of our common stock all reporting units that have goodwill were noted to have a fair value that exceeded their carrying values as of the interim impairment test date the discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 85 to 140 we used perpetual growth rates in the reporting units that have goodwill ranging from 00 to 10 our consumer packaging and victory packaging reporting units had fair values that exceeded their respective carrying values by less than 10 each primarily due to the fair value accounting related to the combination and the mps acquisition for consumer packaging and the kapstone acquisition for victory packaging if we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis points to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill the fair value of each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value except for the consumer packaging reporting unit the consumer packaging and victory packaging reporting units had 35906 million and 402 million of goodwill respectively at september 30 2019 we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter and continually monitored industry economic trends until the end of our fiscal year and determined no additional testing for goodwill impairment was warranted we have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years currently we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material

see item 1a “ risk factors — we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a writedown would adversely impact our operating results and shareholders’ equity ”  

accounting for income taxes

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences projected future taxable income tax planning strategies recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances if any we use significant judgment in i determining whether a tax position based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination and ii measuring the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement we do not record any benefit for the tax positions where we do not meet the more likely than not initial recognition threshold income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized we generally recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income resolution of the uncertain tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or materially benefit our results of operations in future periods depending upon their ultimate resolution a 1 change in our effective tax rate would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately 114 million for fiscal 2019 a 1 change in our effective tax rate used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets as recorded on the september 30 2019 consolidated balance sheet would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately 1213 million for fiscal 2019

business combinations

from time to time we may enter into business combinations in accordance with asc 805 “ business combinations ” we generally recognize the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in an acquiree at their fair values as of the date of acquisition we measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred which we also measure at fair value over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed the acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition including the fair values of identifiable intangible assets deferred tax asset valuation allowances liabilities including those related to debt pensions and other postretirement plans uncertain tax positions contingent consideration and contingencies significant estimates and assumptions include subjective 

 

andor complex judgements regarding items such as discount rates customer attrition rates economic lives and other factors including estimating future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets 

the acquisition method of accounting also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date if we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations no changes in fiscal 2019 to our fiscal 2018 provisional fair value estimates of assets and liabilities assumed in acquisitions have been significant if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could record future impairment charges in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased or the acquired asset could be impaired

pension

the funded status of our qualified and nonqualified us and nonus pension plans decreased 2335 million in fiscal 2019 our us qualified and nonqualified pension plans and nonus pension plans were under funded by 436 million and 422 million respectively as of september 30 2019 our us pension plan benefit obligations were negatively impacted in fiscal 2019 primarily by a 115basis point decrease in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date the nonus pension plan obligations were negatively impacted in fiscal 2019 by a 100basis point decrease in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date a 25basis point change in the discount rate compensation level and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets factoring in our corridor as appropriate would have had the following effect on fiscal 2019 pension expense amounts in the table in parentheses reflect additional income in millions

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk from changes in among other things interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices we aim to identify and understand these risks and then implement strategies to manage them when evaluating these strategies we evaluate the fundamentals of each market our sensitivity to movements in pricing and underlying accounting and business implications to implement these strategies we may enter into various hedging transactions the sensitivity analyses we present below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes we may not be successful in managing these risks

containerboard and paperboard shipments

we are exposed to market risk related to our sales of containerboard and paperboard we sell a significant portion of our mill production and converted products pursuant to contracts that provide that prices are either fixed for specified terms or provide for price adjustments based on negotiated terms including changes in specified index 

 

prices we have the capacity to annually ship approximately 118 million tons in our corrugated packaging segment and approximately 42 million tons in our consumer packaging segment although our mill system operating rates may vary from year to year due to changes in market and other factors our simple average mill system operating rates for the last three years averaged 94 a hypothetical 10 per ton decrease in the price of containerboard and paperboard throughout the year based on our capacity would decrease our sales by approximately 118 million and 42 million in our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments respectively see item 1a “ risk factors — our earnings are highly dependent on volumes ” 

energy

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas coal oil electricity diesel and wood byproducts biomass at times have fluctuated significantly in our recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and at a few mills to generate electricity used on site in our virgin fiber mills we use biomass natural gas and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates we may from time to time use commodity contracts to hedge energy exposures

we spent approximately 879 million on all energy sources in fiscal 2019 to operate our facilities natural gas and electricity each accounted for approximately a third of our total energy purchases in fiscal 2019 while the amount of energy we consume my vary from year to year due to production levels and other factors in fiscal 2020 we expect to consume approximately 84 million mmbtu of natural gas a hypothetical 10 increase in the price of energy throughout the year would increase our cost of energy by approximately 88 million based on fiscal 2019 pricing and consumption

recycled fiber

recycled fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of recycled paperboard and a portion of our containerboard we consume approximately 56 million tons of recycled fiber per year recycled fiber prices can fluctuate significantly our purchases of old corrugated containers and doublelined kraft clippings accounted for our largest recycled fiber costs and approximately 85 to 90 of our recycled fiber purchases the remaining 10 to 15 of our recycled fiber purchases consisted of a number of other grades of recycled paper the mix of recycled fiber may vary due to factors such as market demand availability and pricing a hypothetical 10 increase in recycled fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately 61 million

virgin fiber

virgin fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of a portion of our containerboard bleached paperboard and market pulp while virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices they also fluctuate particularly due to significant changes in weather such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations a hypothetical 10 increase in virgin fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately 151 million

freight

inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us factors that influence our freight expense are items such as distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs primarily diesel we experienced significantly higher freight costs in fiscal 2019 as transportation companies raised prices to address a shortage of drivers and strong demand a hypothetical 10 increase for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately 165 million of which nearly onefifth would be the portion related to higher diesel costs based on our estimated 82 million gallons consumed annually see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs for or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

 

interest rates 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our shortterm and longterm debt as discussed below we may from time to time use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at september 30 2019 including the impact of our interest rate swaps if market interest rates increase an average of 100 basis points our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 25 million we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs this analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment see item 1a “ risk factors — the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ” 

derivative instruments  forward contracts

we periodically may issue and settle foreign currency denominated debt exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates on open balances at each balance sheet date from time to time we may use foreign exchange contracts to hedge these exposures with terms of generally one month based on our open foreign exchange contracts as of september 30 2019 the effect of a 1 change in exchange rates would impact other income net by approximately 4 million although these foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the foreign currency denominated debt exposures the fluctuation of these instruments may cause future cash settlement of the hedge

we periodically may also enter into interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with a portion of our outstanding debt interest rate swaps are either designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of forecasted floating interest payments on variable rate debt or fair value hedges of fixed rate debt or we may elect not to treat them as accounting hedges based on our open interest rate swaps as of september 30 2019 the effect of a 1 change in interest rates would impact interest expense by approximately 6 million we may enter into swaps or forward contracts on certain commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases or sales of those commodities based on our open natural gas contracts as of september 30 2019 the effect of a 1 change in prices would impact cost of goods sold by less than 1 million 

pension plans

our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment among other factors adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities during fiscal 2019 and 2018 the effect of a 025 decrease in the discount rate would have reduced pretax income by approximately 10 million and 11 million respectively and a 025 increase in the discount rate would have increased pretax income by 10 million and 11 million respectively similarly mepps in which we participate could experience similar circumstances which could impact our funding requirements and therefore expenses see “ note 5 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also item 1a “ risk factors —our pension plans will likely require additional cash contributions ” and “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with mepps ” 

foreign currency

we predominately operate in us markets but derived 182 of our net sales in fiscal 2019 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers although we are impacted by the exchange rates of a number of currencies our largest exposures are generally to the brazilian real british pound canadian dollar euro and mexican peso in conducting our foreign operations we also make intercompany sales and receive royalties and dividends denominated in different currencies these activities expose us to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates flows of foreign currencies into and out of our operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements our foreign currency management policy permits us to enter into foreign currency hedges when these flows exceed a threshold which is a function of these cash flows and forecasted annual operations

 

at times certain of our foreign subsidiaries have us dollardenominated external debt in these instances we may hedge the nonfunctional currency exposure with derivatives we issue intercompany loans to and receive foreign cash deposits from our foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates from deposits from time to time we may use foreignexchange hedge contracts with terms of generally less than one year to hedge these exposures although our derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the matched exposures 

during fiscal 2019 and 2018 the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies that we have exposure to versus to the us dollar would have impacted our segment results by approximately 39 million and 36 million respectively see “ note 7 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

during fiscal 2019 and 2018 the effect of a hypothetical 1 change in exchange rates would have impacted accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately 31 million and 37 million respectively this impact does not consider the effects of a stronger or weaker dollar on our ability to compete for export business or the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment changes in foreign exchange rates could impact the price and the demand for our products see item 1a “ risk factors — we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ”

our recycling operations primarily procure recovered paper also known as recycled fiber from our converting facilities and from third parties such as factories warehouses commercial printers office complexes grocery and retail stores document storage facilities paper converters and other wastepaper collectors we handle a wide variety of grades of recovered paper including old corrugated containers office paper box clippings newspaper and print shop scraps we operate recycling facilities that collect sort grade and bale recovered paper and after sorting and baling we transfer it to our mills for processing or sell it principally to manufacturers of paperboard or containerboard in the united states “ us ” as well as manufacturers of tissue newsprint roofing products and insulation and to export markets we operate a nationwide fiber marketing and brokerage system that serves large regional and national accounts as well as our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills and sells scrap materials from our converting businesses and mills brokerage contracts provide bulk purchasing often resulting in lower prices and cleaner recovered paper many of our recycling facilities are located close to our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills which helps promote the availability of supply with reduced shipping costs in fiscal 2019 we plan to operate our recycling operations primarily as a procurement function shifting its focus to the procurement of low cost high quality fiber for our mill system as a result we will no longer record recycling sales sales of corrugated packaging products to external customers accounted for 549 555 and 546 of our net sales in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively see “ note 6 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information

consumer packaging segment

we operate integrated virgin and recycled fiber paperboard mills consumer packaging converting operations which convert items such as folding and beverage cartons displays interior partitions inserts and labels our integrated system of virgin and recycled mills produces paperboard for our converting operations and third parties we internally consume or sell to manufacturers of folding cartons and other paperboard products our coated natural kraft bleached paperboard and coated recycled paperboard and internally consume or sell to manufacturers of solid fiber interior packaging tubes and cores book covers and other paperboard products our specialty recycled paperboard the mill owned by our seven hills paperboard llc “ seven hills ” joint venture in lynchburg va manufactures gypsum paperboard liner for sale to our joint venture partner

 

we are one of the largest manufacturers of folding and beverage cartons in north america we believe we are one of the largest manufacturers of temporary promotional pointofpurchase displays in north america measured by net sales and the largest manufacturer of solid fiber partitions in north america measured by net sales our folding and beverage cartons are used to package items such as food paper beverages dairy products tobacco confectionery health and beauty and other household consumer commercial and industrial products primarily for retail sale our folding and beverage cartons are also used by our customers to attract consumer attention at the pointofsale we manufacture express mail packages for the overnight courier industry provide inserts and labels as well as rigid packaging and other printed packaging products such as transaction cards eg credit debit etc brochures product literature marketing materials such as booklets folders inserts cover sheets and slipcases and grower tags and plant stakes for the horticultural market for the global healthcare market we manufacture secondary packages designed to enhance patient adherence for prescription drugs as well as paperboard packaging for overthecounter and prescription drugs our customers generally use our inserts and labels to provide customer product information either inside a secondary package eg a folding carton or affixed to the outside of a primary package eg a bottle folding cartons typically protect customers’ products during shipment and distribution and employ graphics to promote them at retail we manufacture folding and beverage cartons from recycled and virgin paperboard laminated paperboard and various substrates with specialty characteristics such as grease masking and microwaveability we print coat diecut and glue the cartons to customer specifications and ship finished cartons to customers for assembling filling and sealing we employ a broad range of offset flexographic gravure backside printing coating and finishing technologies as well as iridescent holographic textured and dimensional effects to provide differentiated packaging products and support our customers with new package development innovation and design services and package testing services we manufacture and sell our solid fiber and corrugated partitions and diecut paperboard components principally to glass container manufacturers and producers of beer food wine spirits cosmetics and pharmaceuticals and to the automotive industry 

we design manufacture and in certain cases pack temporary displays for sale to consumer products companies and retailers these displays are used as marketing tools to support new product introductions and specific product promotions in mass merchandising stores supermarkets convenience stores home improvement stores and other retail locations we also design manufacture and in some cases preassemble permanent displays for these customers we make temporary displays primarily from corrugated paperboard unlike temporary displays permanent displays are restocked with our customers’ product therefore they are constructed primarily from metal plastic wood and other durable materials we provide contract packing services such as multiproduct promotional packing and product manipulation such as multipacks and onpacks we manufacture and distribute point of sale material utilizing litho screen and digital printing technologies we manufacture lithographic laminated packaging for sale to our customers that require packaging with high quality graphics and strength characteristics

sales of consumer packaging products to external customers accounted for 442 428 and 446 of our net sales in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively see “ note 6 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information

land and development segment

we are responsible for maximizing the value of the various real estate holdings we own that are concentrated in the charleston sc region some of which are held through partnerships we are in the process of accelerating the monetization of these holdings and expect to complete the monetization during fiscal 2019 after we complete the monetization the segment will cease to exist sales in our land and development segment to external customers accounted for 09 17 and 08 of our net sales in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively see “ note 6 segment information ” and “ note 9 assets held for sale ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information

raw materials

the primary raw materials used by our mill operations are recycled fiber at our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills and virgin fibers from hardwoods and softwoods at our virgin containerboard and paperboard mills certain of our virgin containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate significantly while virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices they also fluctuate particularly during significant changes in weather such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations

 

containerboard and paperboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations our converting operations use many different grades of containerboard and paperboard we supply substantially all of our converting operations needs for containerboard and paperboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps with other manufacturers these arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs because there are other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of containerboard and paperboard used in our converting operations we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from other suppliers in the event we incur production disruptions for recycled or virgin containerboard and paperboard see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ”  

energy

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas coal oil electricity and wood byproducts biomass at times has fluctuated significantly in our recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and at a few mills to generate electricity used on site in our virgin fiber mills we use natural gas biomass and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates see item 1 “ business — governmental regulation — environmental and other matters ” for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

transportation

inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us factors that influence our freight expense are distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from our facilities to our customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs we experienced significantly higher freight costs in fiscal 2018 as transportation companies raised prices to address a shortage of drivers and strong demand the principal markets for our products are in north america south america europe asia and australia see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

sales and marketing

none of our top ten external customers individually accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018 we generally manufacture our products pursuant to customers’ orders we believe that we have good relationships with our customers see item 1a “ risk factors — we depend on certain large customers ” 

as a result of our vertical integration our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products during fiscal 2018 approximately twothirds of our coated natural kraft tons shipped approximately threefifths of our coated recycled paperboard tons shipped and approximately onefifth of our bleached paperboard tons shipped were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture folding and beverage cartons and approximately threefourths of our containerboard tons shipped including trade swaps and buysell transactions were delivered to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products under the terms of our seven hills joint venture arrangement our joint venture partner is required to purchase all of the qualifying gypsum paperboard liner produced by seven hills excluding the production from seven hills and from our aurora il facility which is converted into book covers and other products approximately twofifths of our specialty recycled paperboard tons shipped in fiscal 2018 were delivered to our converting operations primarily to manufacture interior partitions we have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our operations

we aim to execute consistent commercial excellence processes across the company and believe that our ability to leverage our full portfolio of differentiated solutions and capabilities enables us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors

we market our products primarily through our own sales force we also market a number of our products through independent sales representatives independent distributors or both we generally pay our sales personnel a combination of base salary commissions and annual bonus we pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis we discuss foreign net sales to unaffiliated customers and other nonus operations financial and other segment information in “ note 6 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements

 

competition 

we operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large well established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions including industry capacity changes global competition economic conditions in the us and abroad as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates

the industries we operate in are highly competitive and no single company dominates any of those industries our containerboard and paperboard operations compete with integrated and nonintegrated national and regional companies operating primarily in north america and to a limited extent manufacturers outside of north america our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies in the corrugated packaging and folding and beverage carton markets we compete with a significant number of national regional and local packaging suppliers in north america and abroad in the solid fiber interior packaging promotional pointofpurchase display and converted paperboard products markets we primarily compete with a smaller number of national regional and local companies offering highly specialized products our recycled fiber brokerage and collection operations compete with various other companies for the procurement and supply of recovered paper including brokers and companies that export recovered paper to international markets the land and development segment competes in the real estate sales and development market primarily in the charleston sc region

because all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly discuss sales opportunities for new business or for renewal of existing business with customers our packaging products compete with packaging made from other materials including plastics the primary competitive factors we face include price design product innovation quality and service with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences we believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and we obtain feedback on our performance with customer surveys among other means

the businesses we operate in have undergone consolidation within the packaging products industry larger customers with an expanded geographic presence have tended to seek suppliers that can because of their broad geographic presence efficiently and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs in addition our customers continue to demand higher quality products meeting stricter quality control requirements

see item 1a “ risk factors — we face intense competition ” and “risk factors — we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ” 

governmental regulation

health and safety regulations

our operations are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health including the occupational safety and health act of 1970 “ osha ” and similar laws and regulations osha among other things establishes asbestos standards for the workplace although we do not use asbestos in manufacturing our products asbestos containing material “ acm ” is present in some of our facilities for those facilities where acm is present we have established procedures for properly managing the material including but not limited to employee training and work practices to maintain the acm in good condition and minimize exposure we do not believe that future compliance with health and safety laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

environmental and other matters

environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business we employ manufacturing processes that result in various discharges emissions and wastes these processes are subject to numerous federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various governmental authorities

on january 31 2013 the us environmental protection agency “ epa ” published a set of four interrelated final rules establishing national air emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants from industrial commercial and institutional boilers and process heaters commonly known as “ boiler mact ” boiler mact required compliance by january 31 2016 or by january 31 2017 for those mills for which we obtained a prior compliance extension all 

 

work required for our boilers to comply with the rule has been completed on july 29 2016 the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a ruling on the consolidated cases challenging boiler mact the court vacated key portions of the rule including emission limits for certain subcategories of solid fuel boilers and remanded other issues to the epa for further rulemaking at this time we cannot predict with certainty how this decision will impact our existing boiler mact strategies or whether we will incur additional costs to comply with any revised boiler mact standards 

in addition to boiler mact we are subject to a number of other federal state local and international environmental rules that may impact our business including the national ambient air quality standards for nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide fine particulate matter and ozone for facilities in the us

we are involved in various administrative proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business and we may become involved in similar matters in the future although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information we do not believe that the currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

see item 1a “ risk factors — we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs ” 

cercla and other remediation costs

we face potential liability under federal state local and international laws as a result of releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment from various sites owned and operated by third parties at which companygenerated wastes have allegedly been deposited generators of hazardous substances sent to offsite disposal locations at which environmental problems exist as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons are liable for response costs for the investigation and remediation of such sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “ cercla ” and analogous laws while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla liability is typically shared with other potentially responsible parties “ prps ” and costs are commonly allocated according to relative amounts of waste deposited and other factors

in addition certain of our current or former locations are being investigated or remediated under various environmental laws including cercla based on information known to us and assumptions we do not believe that the costs of these projects will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows however the discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations including natural resources damaged at these or other sites in the future could result in additional costs

on january 26 2009 smurfitstone container corporation “ smurfitstone ” and certain of its subsidiaries filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code smurfitstone’s canadian subsidiaries also filed to reorganize in canada we believe that matters relating to previously identified third party prp sites and certain facilities formerly owned or operated by smurfitstone have been satisfied by claims in the smurfitstone bankruptcy proceedings however we may face additional liability for cleanup activity at sites that are not subject to the bankruptcy discharge but are not currently identified the final bankruptcy distributions were made in fiscal 2018

we believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under purchase and other agreements in connection with certain remediation sites in addition we believe that we have insurance coverage subject to applicable deductiblesretentions policy limits and other conditions for certain environmental matters however there can be no assurance that we will be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights or that if we are successful any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights will be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses we also cannot predict with certainty whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at other locations and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed current reserves in addition we cannot currently assess with certainty the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or federal state or other environmental laws regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows

 

we estimate that we will invest approximately 22 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2019 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance excluding kapstone it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions and the project completion dates may change and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects and the outcomes of pending legal challenges to the boiler mact rules 

climate change

certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have taken actions to address climate change the epa has issued the clean air act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit greenhouse gases “ ghg ” the epa also has promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to file an annual report of their emissions while we have facilities subject to existing ghg permitting and reporting requirements the impact of these requirements has not been material to date

additionally the epa has been working on a set of interrelated rulemakings aimed at cutting carbon emissions from power plants on august 3 2015 the epa issued a final rule establishing ghg emission guidelines for existing electric utility generating units known as the “ clean power plan ” on the same day the epa issued a second rulesetting standards of performance for new modified and reconstructed electric utility generating units on february 9 2016 the us supreme court issued a stay halting implementation of the clean power plan until the pending legal challenges to the rule are resolved as directed by executive order by the president of the united states “ executive order ” on april 4 2017 the epa issued a proposed rule announcing its intention to review the clean power plan and if appropriate initiate proceedings to suspend revise or rescind it a number of states subject to the clean power plan have stopped working on their implementation strategies in response to the litigation and executive order however certain states where we operate manufacturing facilities have indicated their intention to continue their carbon reduction efforts on august 21 2018 the epa proposed the affordable clean energy “ ace ” rule which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coalfired power plants the ace rule would replace the 2015 clean power plan which epa has proposed to repeal  the clean power plan was stayed by the us supreme court and has never gone into effect although the clean power plan and ace rule do not apply directly to the power generation facilities at our mills if either rule becomes effective it would have the potential to increase the cost of purchased electricity for our manufacturing operations and change the treatment of certain types of biomass that are currently considered carbon neutral due to ongoing litigation and other uncertainties regarding the clean power plan and ace rule their potential impacts on us cannot be quantified with certainty at this time

in addition to national efforts to regulate climate change some us states in which we have manufacturing operations are also taking measures to reduce ghg emissions such as requiring ghg emissions reporting or developing regional capandtrade programs california has enacted a capandtrade program that took effect in 2012 and includes enforceable compliance obligations that began on january 1 2013 in july 2017 california extended the capandtrade program to 2030 we do not have any manufacturing facilities that are subject to the capandtrade requirements in california however we are continuing to monitor the implementation of this program as well as proposed mandatory ghg reduction efforts in other states also the washington department of ecology issued a final rule known as the clean air rule which applies to facilities that have average annual carbon dioxide equivalent emissions equal to or exceeding 100000 metric tonsyear energy intensive and trade exposed facilities including our tacoma wa and longview wa which we acquired through the kapstone acquisition as hereinafter defined mills and transportation fuel importers are subject to regulation under this program in september 2016 various groups filed lawsuits against the washington department of ecology challenging the clean air rule in april 2018 the thurston county superior court invalidated the clean air rule and the washington department of ecology subsequently filed an appeal with the state supreme court the court has not yet decided whether to grant the appeal implementation of the clean air rule has been stayed in the meantime 

the agreement signed in april 2016 among the us and over 170 other countries which arose out of negotiations at the united nation’s conference of parties cop21 climate summit in december 2015 the “ paris agreement ” established a framework for reducing global ghg emissions by signing the paris agreement the us made a nonbinding commitment to reduce economywide ghg emissions by 26 to 28 below 2005 levels by 2025 other countries in which we conduct business including china european union member states and india have set ghg reduction targets the paris agreement became effective on november 4 2016 although a party to the agreement may not provide the required oneyear notice of withdrawal until three years after the effective date in june 2017 president trump announced that the us intended to withdraw from the paris agreement the 

 

governors of new york california and washington subsequently announced their intent to form a “climate alliance” to coordinate a state response to climate change at this time it is not possible to determine how the paris agreement or any potential us commitments in lieu of those under the agreement may impact us industrial facilities including our domestic operations 

several of our international facilities are located in countries that have already adopted ghg emissions trading schemes for example quebec has become a member of the western climate initiative which is a collaboration among california and certain canadian provinces that have joined together to create a capandtrade program to reduce ghg emissions in 2009 quebec adopted a target of reducing ghg emissions by 20 below 1990 levels by 2020 and 375 from 1990 levels by 2030 in 2011 quebec issued a final regulation establishing a regional capandtrade program that required reductions in ghg emissions from covered emitters as of january 1 2013 the province formally linked its carbon trading system with california’s system in january 2014 and with ontario’s system in january 2018 our mill in quebec is subject to these capandtrade requirements although the direct impact of this regulation has not been material to date compliance with this program and other similar programs may require future expenditures to meet required ghg emission reduction requirements in future years

the regulation of climate change continues to develop in the areas of the world where we conduct business we have systems in place for tracking the ghg emissions from our energyintensive facilities and we carefully monitor developments in climate change laws regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations financial condition cash flows and disclosure obligations

sustainability

sustainability is an integral part of our business strategy and one of our four stated key value drivers for our customers paperbased packaging has several attributes that we believe makes it wellsuited to helping our customers provide sustainable solutions for their customers for example it is lightweight durable versatile renewable and recyclable given the size and geographic breadth of our manufacturing operations and our history of developing innovative products and solutions we believe that we are uniquely positioned to help our customers improve their sustainability also we are helping to drive the development of the circular economy by recovering used paperbased packaging through our extensive network of recycling facilities and turning the recovered fiber into new packaging or selling it to others to use to make new products examples of our commitment to sustainability include having one of the industry’s largest certified virgin fiber procurement systems and heading an industryleading foodservice recycling initiative we have been recognized for our sustainability efforts through among other things industry award programs and inclusion in the ftse 4 good index

patents and other intellectual property

we hold a substantial number of foreign and domestic trademarks trademark applications trade names patents patent applications and licenses relating to our business our products and our production processes our patent portfolio consists primarily of utility and design patents relating to our products and manufacturing operations it also includes exclusive rights to substantial proprietary packaging system technology in the us or other licenses obtained from a third party our brand name and logo and certain of our products and services are protected by domestic and foreign trademark rights our patents trademarks and other intellectual property rights particularly those relating to our converting operations are important to our operations as a whole our intellectual property has various expiration dates see item 1a “ risk factors — we depend on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products andor to acquire and retain intellectual property rights ” 

employees

at september 30 2018 we employed approximately 45100 people of which approximately 76 were located in the us and canada and 24 were located in europe south america mexico and asiapacific of the approximately 45100 employees approximately 71 were hourly and approximately 29 were salaried employees approximately 41 of our hourly employees in the us and canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements “ cba or cbas ” which typically have four to six year terms approximately 3 of our employees in the us and canada are working under expired contracts and approximately 2 of our us and canada employees are covered under cbas that expire within one year approximately 49 of our employees outside the us and canada are covered by agreements similar to cbas which most frequently have four to six year terms approximately 5 of our employees not based in the us and canada are working under expired agreements and approximately 6 of them are covered under agreements that expire within one year

 

while we have experienced isolated work stoppages in the past we have been able to resolve them and we believe that working relationships with our employees are generally good while the terms of our cbas vary we believe the material terms of the agreements are customary for the industry the type of facility the classification of the employees and the geographic location covered 

in october 2014 we entered into a master agreement with the united steelworkers union “ usw ” that applied to substantially all of our legacy rocktenn facilities represented by the usw at that time the agreement has a six year term and covers a number of specific items including wages medical coverage and certain other benefit programs substance abuse testing and successorship individual facilities will continue to have local agreements for subjects not covered by the master agreement and those agreements will continue to have staggered terms wage increases specified in the master agreement have been negotiated and ratified the master agreement permits us to apply its terms to usw employees who work at facilities we acquire during the term of the agreement the master agreement covers approximately 60 of our us facilities and approximately 6800 of our employees

see item 1a “ risk factors — we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters ” 

international operations

our operations outside the us are conducted through subsidiaries located in canada mexico south america europe asia and australia sales attributable to nonus operations were 199 176 and 171 of our net sales in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively some of which were transacted in us dollars see “ note 6 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we are exposed to risks related to international sales and operations ”

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to certain risks and events that if one or more occur could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock par value 001 per share “ common stock ” in evaluating us our business and a potential investment in our securities you should consider the following risk factors and the other information presented in this report as well as the other reports and 

 

registration statements we file from time to time with the sec the risks addressed below are not the only ones we face additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely impact our business in the future 

we may experience pricing variability

our businesses have experienced and are likely to continue experiencing cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions the length and magnitude of these cycles have varied over time and by product prices for our products are driven by many factors including general economic conditions demand for our products and competitive conditions in the industries within which we compete and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes which may be unpredictable and volatile if supply exceeds demand prices for our products could decline and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected for example we believe the trading price of our common stock was adversely affected in fiscal 2018 due in part to concerns about announcements by certain of our competitors of planned additional capacity in the north american containerboard market

further certain published indices contribute to the setting of selling prices for some of our products future changes in how these indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the selling prices for these products

our earnings are highly dependent on volumes

because our operations generally have high fixed operating cost components our earnings are highly dependent on volumes which tend to fluctuate these fluctuations make it difficult to predict our financial results with any degree of certainty any failure to maintain volumes may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may face increased costs or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation

we rely heavily on the use of certain raw materials energy sources and thirdparty companies to transport our goods

the costs of recycled fiber and virgin fiber the principal externally sourced raw materials for our mills are subject to pricing variability due to market and industry conditions increasing demand for products packaged in packaging produced from paper manufactured from 100 recycled fiber greater demand for ussourced recycled fiber by asianbased paper manufacturers and the shift by manufacturers of virgin paperboard tissue newsprint and corrugated packaging to the production of products with some recycled fiber content have and may continue to increase demand for recycled fiber which may result in cost increases periods of higher recycled fiber costs and unusual price volatility have occurred in the past including during 2017 as demand for domestic recycled fiber from asian producers fluctuated significantly the market price of virgin fiber varies based on availability source and the cost of fuels used in the harvesting and transportation of virgin fiber and the availability of virgin fiber may be impacted by among other factors the weather in addition costs for key chemicals used in our manufacturing operations also fluctuate which impacts our manufacturing costs certain published indices contribute to price setting for some of our raw materials future changes in how these indices are established or maintained could adversely impact the pricing of these raw materials

the cost of natural gas which we use in many of our manufacturing operations including many of our mills and other energy costs including energy generated by burning natural gas fuel oil biomass and coal has at times fluctuated significantly high energy costs could increase our operating costs and make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors

we distribute our products primarily by truck and rail although we also distribute some of our products by cargo ship the reduced availability of trucks rail cars or cargo ships could negatively impact our ability to distribute our products in a timely manner and high transportation costs could make our products less competitive compared to similar or alternative products offered by competitors in fiscal 2018 the profitability of our operations in the us was negatively impacted by higher transportation costs as trucking companies raised prices to address a shortage of drivers and strong demand and the profitability of our operations in brazil was negatively impacted by a truckers’ strike

 

because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we may not be able to recoup past or future increases in the cost of raw materials energy or transportation through price increases for our products the failure to obtain raw materials energy or transportation services at reasonable market prices or the failure to pass on price increases to our customers or a reduction in the availability of raw materials energy or transportation services due to increased demand significant changes in climate or weather conditions or other factors could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we face intense competition

we compete in industries that are highly competitive and no single company dominates an industry our competitors include large and small vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller nonintegrated companies we generally compete with companies operating in north america although we have operations spanning north america south america europe asia and australia factors affecting our ability to compete include the entry of new competitors into the markets we serve increased competition from overseas producers our competitors’ pricing strategies the introduction by our competitors of new technologies and equipment our ability to anticipate and respond to changing customer preferences and our ability to maintain the costefficiency of our facilities in addition changes within these industries including the consolidation of our competitors and our customers may adversely affect our competitiveness if our competitors are more successful than we are with respect to any key competitive factor our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected

our products also compete to some extent with various other packaging materials including products made of paper plastics wood and various types of metal customer shifts away from containerboard and paperboard packaging to packaging made from other materials could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may be unsuccessful in making and integrating mergers acquisitions and investments and completing divestitures

we have completed a number of mergers acquisitions investments and divestitures in recent years including the combination our investment in grupo gondi the separation the hhb sale the mps acquisition and the acquisition the “ kapstone acquisition ” of all of the outstanding shares of kapstone paper and packaging corporation “ kapstone ” and we may acquire invest in or sell or enter into joint ventures with additional companies we may not be able to identify suitable targets or purchasers or successfully complete suitable transactions in the future and completed transactions may not be successful these transactions create risks including but not limited to risks associated with

 





















 

in addition mergers acquisitions and investments may not be successful and may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock among the benefits we expect from potential as well as completed acquisitions and joint ventures are synergies cost savings growth opportunities or access to new markets or a combination thereof and in the case of divestitures the realization of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets to purchasers that place higher strategic value on these businesses and assets than we do for acquisitions our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of realizing them depend on the successful integration of the acquired businesses and operations with our business and operations even if we are able to integrate these businesses and operations successfully we may not realize the full benefits we expected within the anticipated timeframe or at all accordingly the benefits from acquisitions may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays in integrating the acquired companies 

on november 2 2018 for example we completed the kapstone acquisition we expect the kapstone acquisition to generate synergies and performance improvements of approximately 200 million by the end of fiscal 2021 the success of the transaction will depend on among other things our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities cost savings and other synergies our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of realizing these benefits will depend on us successfully integrating the kapstone business with our corrugated packaging business which may be more difficult complex costly and time consuming than we expect the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the kapstone acquisition may disrupt ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with employees suppliers customers and others if we are not able to successfully integrate the kapstone business within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected cost savings and synergies and other benefits of the kapstone acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer or cost us more to realize than expected the combined businesses may not perform as expected management’s time and energy may be diverted and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 

our acquisition of kapstone subjects us to various risks and uncertainties

as a result of the kapstone acquisition we are subject to various risks and uncertainties including the following we may fail to realize anticipated synergies cost savings operating efficiencies and other benefits our incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with financing the acquisition may have an adverse effect on our liquidity limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions we may not be able to integrate kapstone into our operations without encountering difficulties including inconsistencies in standards systems and controls and without diverting management’s focus and resources from ordinary business activities and opportunities we may face challenges retaining kapstone’s customers and suppliers we may fail to retain kapstone’s key personnel we may encounter unforeseen internal control regulatory or compliance issues and we may face other additional risks we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits from the kapstone acquisition or it may take us longer or cost us more than expected to achieve them any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change

our businesses may be affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control such as













for example we may experience lower demand for our products and the products of our customers that utilize our products if economic conditions in the us and globally including locations such as europe brazil and mexico 

 

deteriorate and result in higher unemployment rates lower family income unfavorable currency exchange rates lower corporate earnings lower business investment or lower consumer spending in addition changes in trade policy including renegotiating or potentially terminating existing bilateral or multilateral agreements as well as the imposition of tariffs could impact demand for our products and the costs associated with certain of our capital investments macroeconomic challenges may also lead to changes in tax laws or tax rates that may have a material impact on our future cash taxes effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities we are not able to predict with certainty economic and financial market conditions and social and political change and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected by adverse market conditions and social and political change 

we cannot operate our joint ventures solely for our benefit which subjects us to risks

we have invested in joint ventures when circumstances warranted the use of these structures and we may form additional joint ventures in the future our participation in joint ventures is subject to risks including but not limited to risks associated with













we may utilize our cash flow or incur additional indebtedness to satisfy certain payment obligations or otherwise increase our investment in grupo gondi

in connection with our investment in the joint venture with grupo gondi we entered into an option agreement pursuant to which we and certain shareholders of grupo gondi agreed to future put and call options with respect to the equity interests in the joint venture held by each party these arrangements or other arrangements pursuant to which we increase our ownership in grupo gondi may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to satisfy our payment or investment obligations which may reduce the amount of funds available for our operations capital expenditures and corporate development activities similarly we may be required to incur additional indebtedness to satisfy our payment or investment obligations

we are exposed to risks related to international sales and operations

we derived 199 of our net sales in fiscal 2018 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers our operating results and business prospects could be adversely affected by risks related to the countries outside the us in which we have manufacturing facilities or sell our products specifically brazil china mexico and india where we maintain operations directly or through a joint venture are countries that are exposed to economic political and social instability we are exposed to risks of operating in those countries as well as many others including but not limited to risks associated with











 













any one or more of these risks could adversely affect our international operations and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we depend on certain large customers

our corrugated packaging segment and consumer packaging segment each have large customers the loss of which could adversely affect the segment’s sales and depending on the significance of the loss our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in particular because our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments we regularly bid for new business or for the renewal of existing business the loss of business from our larger customers or the renewal of business on less favorable terms may adversely impact our financial results

we may fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences

our success depends in part on our ability to offer differentiated solutions and we must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments and changing customer preferences the services and products we offer customers may not meet their needs as their business models evolve or our customers may decide to decrease or use alternative materials for their product packaging or forego the packaging of certain products entirely regulatory developments can also significantly alter the market for our solutions for example a move to electronic distribution of disclaimers and other paperless regimes could negatively impact our healthcare inserts and labels businesses consumer preferences for products and packaging formats are constantly changing based on among other factors cost convenience and health environmental and social concerns and perceptions for example changing consumer dietary habits and preferences have slowed sales growth for many of the food and beverage products we package also we believe that there is an increasing focus among consumers to ensure that products delivered through ecommerce are packaged efficiently and we are working with our customers to address this concern our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected if we fail to anticipate trends that would enable us to offer products that respond to changing customer preferences

we may produce faulty or contaminated products due to failures in quality control measures and systems

our failure to produce products that meet safety and quality standards could result in adverse effects on consumer health litigation exposure loss of market share and adverse financial impacts among other potential consequences and we may incur substantial costs in taking appropriate corrective action up to and including recalling products from end consumers and to reimburse customers andor end consumers for losses that they suffer as a result of these failures placing an unsafe product on the market failing to notify the regulatory authorities of a safety issue failing to take appropriate corrective action and failing to meet other regulatory requirements relating to product safety could lead to regulatory investigation enforcement action andor prosecution any product quality or safety issue may also result in adverse publicity which may damage our reputation any of these results could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we provide guarantees in certain of our contracts that our products are produced in accordance with customer specifications regarding the proper functioning of our products and the conformity of a product to the specific use 

 

defined by the customer in addition if the product contained in packaging manufactured by us is faulty or contaminated the manufacturer of the product may allege that the packaging we provided caused the fault or contamination even if the packaging complies with contractual specifications if certain of our packaging fails to open properly or to preserve the integrity of its contents we could face liability to our customers and to third parties for bodily injury or other damages suffered as a result these liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we may incur business disruptions

the operations at our manufacturing facilities may be interrupted or impaired by various operating risks including but not limited to risks associated with

























for example in 2018 operations at our mills located in florence south carolina and panama city fl were interrupted by hurricanes resulting in lost mill production and the incurrence of damages supply chain disruptions and increased input costs see “ note 23 subsequent events unaudited ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the panama city fl mill

business disruptions may impair our production capabilities and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business

at september 30 2018 we had 64 billion of debt outstanding in connection with the closing of the kapstone acquisition we incurred approximately 44 billion of additional debt the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences including









 



in addition we are subject to agreements that require us to meet and maintain certain financial ratios and covenants and may restrict us from among other things disposing of assets and incurring additional indebtedness these restrictions may limit our flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and competitive pressures

downgrades in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs

some of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from rating agencies these ratings are limited in scope and do not purport to address all risks relating to an investment in those debt securities our credit ratings could change based on among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and they may be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a socalled “watch list” for a possible downgrade or assigned a “negative outlook” if in any rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could increase our borrowing costs which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock if a downgrade or negative outlook were to occur it could impact our ability to access the capital markets to raise debt andor increase the cost thereof in addition while our credit ratings are important to us we may take actions and otherwise operate our business in a manner that adversely affects our credit ratings

we are subject to a wide variety of laws regulations and other requirements that are subject to change and may impose substantial compliance costs 

we are subject to a wide variety of federal state local and foreign laws regulations and other requirements including those relating to the environment competition corruption health and safety labor and employment data privacy tax and health care these laws regulations and other requirements may change or be applied or interpreted in ways that will require us to modify our operations subject us to enforcement risk or impose on or require us to incur additional costs including substantial compliance costs which may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant capital operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations particularly those related to air and water quality waste disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater including situations where we have been identified as a prp because environmental regulations are constantly evolving we will continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with those laws and our compliance costs could increase materially future remediation requirements and compliance with existing and new laws and requirements may disrupt our business operations and require significant expenditures and our existing reserves for specific matters may not be adequate to cover future costs in particular our manufacturing operations consume significant amounts of energy and we may in the future incur additional or increased capital operating and other expenditures from changes due to new or increased climaterelated and other environmental regulations we could also incur substantial liabilities including fines or sanctions enforcement actions natural resource damages claims cleanup and closure costs and thirdparty claims for property damage and personal injury under environmental and common laws 

the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 “ fcpa ” and local antibribery laws including those in brazil china mexico india and the united kingdom where we maintain operations directly or through a joint venture prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of influencing official decisions our internal control policies and procedures or those of our vendors may not adequately protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed or alleged to have been committed by our employees agents or vendors any such violations could lead to civil or criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties andor could damage our reputation 

we are subject to a number of labor and employment laws and regulations that could significantly increase our operating costs and reduce our operational flexibility additionally changing privacy laws in the united states europe and elsewhere including the adoption by the european union of the general data protection regulation which became effective in may 2018 have created new individual privacy rights imposed increased obligations on companies handling personal data and increased potential exposure to fines and penalties

 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the  tax act  the tax act contains significant changes to corporate taxation including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 additional limitations on the tax deductibility of interest substantial changes to the taxation of foreign earnings immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate the overall impact of the tax act remains uncertain 

our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated

we regularly make capital expenditures and many of our projects are complex costly andor implemented over an extended period of time for example in fiscal 2018 we announced a significant planned investment in our florence south carolina kraft linerboard mill and we are currently in the process of building a new corrugated box plant in the brazilian state of sao paulo and upgrading our tres barras mill our capital expenditures for these and other projects could be higher than we anticipated we may experience unanticipated business disruptions andor we may not achieve the desired benefits from the projects any of which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock in addition disputes between us and contractors who are involved with implementing projects could lead to timeconsuming and costly litigation

we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring

we have previously restructured portions of our operations and we may engage in future restructuring initiatives because we are not able to predict with certainty market conditions including changes in the supply and demand for our products the loss of large customers the selling prices for our products or the cost of manufacturing our products we also may not be able to predict with certainty the appropriate time to undertake restructurings the cash and noncash costs associated with these activities vary depending on the type of facility impacted with the noncash cost of a mill closure generally being more significant than that of a converting facility due to the higher level of investment restructuring activities may divert the attention of management disrupt our operations and fail to achieve the intended cost and operations benefits

we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a writedown would adversely impact our operating results and shareholders’ equity 

at september 30 2018 the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets was 87 billion we review the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when impairment indicators exist the impairment test requires us to analyze a number of factors and make estimates that require judgment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we identified our consumer packaging reporting unit as having a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 future changes in the cost of capital expected cash flows changes in our business strategy and external market conditions among other factors could require us to record an impairment charge for goodwill which could lead to decreased assets and reduced net income if a significant write down were required the charge could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and shareholders’ equity and could impact the trading price of our common stock see “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — goodwill and longlived assets ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters

a significant number of our union employees are governed by cbas expired contracts are in the process of renegotiation and others expire within one year we may not be able to successfully negotiate new union contracts without work stoppages or labor difficulties or renegotiate them on favorable terms we have experienced work stoppages in the past and may experience them in the future if we are unable to successfully renegotiate the terms of any of these agreements or an industry association is unable to successfully negotiate a national agreement when it expires or if we experience any extended interruption of operations at any of our facilities as a result of strikes or other work stoppages our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected in addition our businesses rely on vendors suppliers and other third parties that have union employees strikes or work stoppages affecting these vendors suppliers and other third parties could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

 

certain of our pension plans will likely require additional cash contributions 

while the westrock company consolidated pension plan the “ plan ” is overfunded we expect to make future contributions primarily to certain of our nonus pension plans in the coming years in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate and meet regulatory requirements the actual required amounts and timing of future cash contributions will be highly sensitive to changes in the applicable discount rates and returns on plan assets and could also be impacted by future changes in the laws and regulations applicable to plan funding our pension plan assets are primarily made up of fixed income equity and alternative investments fluctuations in the market performance of these assets and changes in interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension plan costs in future periods changes in assumptions regarding expected longterm rate of return on plan assets our discount rate expected compensation levels or mortality could also increase or decrease pension costs these changes along with future turmoil in financial and capital markets may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with the mepps in which we participate

we participate in several mepps that provide retirement benefits to certain union employees in accordance with various cbas our contributions to a particular mepp are established by the applicable cbas however our required contributions may increase based on the declining funded status of an mepp and legal requirements such as those of the pension act which require substantially underfunded mepps to implement a funding improvement plan “ fip ” or a rehabilitation plan “ rp ” to improve their funded status factors that could impact the funded status of a mepp include without limitation a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans the inability or failure of companies withdrawing from the plan to pay their withdrawal liability low interest rates changes in actuarial assumptions andor lower than expected returns on pension fund assets

we believe that certain of the mepps in which we participate or have participated including piumpf have material unfunded vested benefits in the normal course of business we evaluate our potential exposure to mepps including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from piumpf and the central sates southeast and southwest areas pension fund “ central states ” and recorded aggregate withdrawal liabilities of 1842 million which includes an estimate of our portion of piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency our withdrawal liability for any particular mepp would depend on the nature and timing of any triggering event and the extent of that mepp’s funding of vested benefits in addition we may be obligated to pay a share of a particular mepp’s accumulated funding deficiency as determined under the pension act due to the absence of specific information regarding the applicable funded status and other relevant information for each mepp we are unable to determine with certainty the exact amount of any withdrawal liability and our estimate for withdrawing from piumpf is subject to revision we may withdraw from other mepps in the future

the impact of increased contributions future funding obligations or future withdrawal liabilities may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock see “ note 4 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

we are subject to cybersecurity risks including related to customer employee vendor or other company data

we use information technologies to securely manage operations and various business functions we rely on various technologies some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including reporting on our business and interacting with customers vendors and employees in addition we collect and store certain data including proprietary business information and may have access to confidential or personal information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls our systems are subject to repeated attempts by third parties to access information or to disrupt our systems despite our security design and controls and those of our thirdparty providers we may become subject to system damage disruptions or shutdowns due to any number of causes including cyberattacks breaches employee error or malfeasance power outages computer viruses telecommunication or utility failures systems failures service providers natural disasters or other catastrophic events it is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected 

 

for an extended period of time we may face other challenges and risks as we upgrade and standardize our information technology systems as part of our integration of acquired businesses and operations we maintain contingency plans to prevent or mitigate the impact of these events however these events could result in operational disruptions or the misappropriation of sensitive data and depending on their nature and scope could lead to the compromise of confidential information improper use of our systems and networks manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes operational disruptions and exposure to liability such disruptions or misappropriations and the resulting repercussions including reputational damage and legal claims or proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock 

we depend on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products andor to acquire and retain intellectual property rights

our ability to develop and successfully market new products and to develop acquire andor retain necessary intellectual property rights is important to our continued success and competitive position if we are unable to develop and successfully introduce new products protect our existing intellectual property rights or develop new intellectual property rights or if others develop similar or improved technologies our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected

we are subject to risks associated with monetizing our land and development asset portfolio

in fiscal 2016 we commenced an accelerated monetization strategy of various real estate holdings that are concentrated in the charleston sc region and we expect to complete this process during fiscal 2019 our ability to execute our plans may be affected by general economic conditions including credit markets and interest rates local real estate market conditions including competition from sellers of land and real estate developers and the impact of federal state and local laws and regulations affecting land use land use entitlements land protection and zoning among other factors any failure to execute our plans could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel including key personnel

our ability to maintain and expand our business depends on our ability to attract motivate train and retain employees with the skills necessary to understand and adapt to the continuously developing needs of our customers the increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience changing demographics and labor work force trends also may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire if we fail to attract motivate train and retain qualified personnel or if we experience excessive turnover we may experience declining sales manufacturing delays or other inefficiencies increased recruiting training and relocation costs and other difficulties and our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted

in addition we rely on key executive and management personnel to manage our business efficiently and effectively as our business has grown in size and geographic scope we have relied on these individuals to manage increasingly complex projects teams and operations and to allocate resources to match the size and geographic scope of our business the loss of any of our key personnel could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely impacted effective succession planning is also important to our longterm success our failure to identify candidates with the leadership skills to manage our increasingly complex organization and our failure to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key executives could hinder our strategic planning and execution

the separation could result in substantial tax liability to us and to those of our stockholders who received ingevity stock at the time of the separation

we have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and the rules and regulations thereunder “ code ” the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from ingevity and us regarding the past and future conduct of each of the two companies’ respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings prove to be 

 

incorrect or not satisfied or if the us internal revenue service “ irs ” otherwise determines on audit that the separation is taxable our stockholders who received ingevity stock at the time of the separation andor we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities if the separation is determined to be taxable to those of our stockholders who received ingevity stock at the time of the separation each of those stockholders would generally be treated as having received a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the ingevity shares received 

even if the separation otherwise qualifies as a taxfree transaction to those of our stockholders who received ingevity stock at the time of the separation the distribution could be taxable to us in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of ingevity are determined to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the separation in this event the resulting tax liability would be substantial in connection with the separation we entered into a tax matters agreement with ingevity pursuant to which ingevity agreed a to not engage in certain transactions that could cause the separation to be taxable to us and b to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions the indemnity from ingevity may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities any tax liabilities resulting from the separation or related transactions could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation

we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with ingevity to govern the separation and the relationship of the two companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and ingevity the indemnity rights we have against ingevity under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us in addition our indemnity obligations to ingevity may be significant and these risks could adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the trading price of our common stock

business

 



 

 

in fiscal 2018 we continued to pursue our strategy of offering differentiated paper and packaging solutions that help our customers win we successfully executed this strategy in fiscal 2018 in a rapidly changing cost and price environment net sales of 162851 million for fiscal 2018 increased 14254 million or 96 compared to fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily a result of an increase in corrugated packaging segment sales driven by higher selling pricemix and the contributions from acquisitions and increased consumer packaging segment sales primarily due to the contribution from acquisitions primarily the mps acquisition these increases were partially offset by the absence of net sales from hhb in fiscal 2018 due to the sale of hhb in april 2017 and lower land and development segment sales compared to the prior year period due to the timing of real estate sales as we monetize the portfolio and lower merchandising display sales in the consumer packaging segment segment income increased 4915 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to increased corrugated packaging segment income with respect to segment income we experienced higher levels of cost inflation during fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 which was partially offset by recycled fiber deflation the primary inflationary items were freight costs chemical costs virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs productivity improvements in fiscal 2018 more than offset the net impact of cost inflation while it is difficult to predict specific inflationary items we expect higher cost inflation to continue through fiscal 2019

 

our corrugated packaging segment increased its net sales by 6951 million in fiscal 2018 to 91034 million from 84083 million in fiscal 2017 the increase in net sales was primarily due to higher corrugated selling pricemix and higher corrugated volumes including acquisitions which were partially offset by lower net sales from recycling operations due to lower recycled fiber costs lower sales related to the deconsolidation of a foreign joint venture in fiscal 2017 and the impact of foreign currency north american box shipments increased 41 on a per day basis in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 segment income attributable to the corrugated packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased 4540 million to 12079 million compared to 7539 million in fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher selling pricemix lower recycled fiber costs and productivity improvements which were partially offset by higher levels of cost inflation and other items including increased depreciation and amortization

 

our consumer packaging segment increased its net sales by 8389 million in fiscal 2018 to 72914 million from 64525 million in fiscal 2017 the increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in net sales from acquisitions primarily the mps acquisition and higher selling pricemix partially offset by the absence of net sales from hhb in fiscal 2018 due to the hhb sale in april 2017 and lower volumes segment income attributable to 

 

the consumer packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased 288 million to 4546 million compared to 4258 million in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of productivity improvements lower depreciation and amortization excluding the mps acquisition higher selling pricemix and income from acquisitions which were partially offset by cost inflation and other items the absence of income from hhb in fiscal 2018 due to the hhb sale in april 2017 and lower volumes  consumer packaging’s segment income in fiscal 2017 included a 251 million acquisition inventory stepup charge related primarily to the mps acquisition 

 

our land and development segment sales were 1424 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 2438 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the timing of land sales associated with our accelerated monetization we expect to complete the monetization of our portfolio during fiscal 2019 after we complete the monetization the segment will cease to exist segment income attributable to the land and development segment was 225 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 138 million in fiscal 2017

 

we generated 24209 million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018 compared to 19005 million in fiscal 2017 we remained committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy during fiscal 2018 by investing 9999 million in capital expenditures deployed 3479 million to strategic acquisitions and investments while returning 4409 million in dividends and 1951 million to our stockholders in share repurchases we believe our strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest to sustain and improve our operating performance in fiscal 2019 we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 15 billion including kapstone see “ liquidity and capital resources ” for more information 

a detailed review of our fiscal 2018 performance appears below under “ results of operations consolidated ” and “ results of operations — segment data ”

results of operations consolidated

the following table summarizes our consolidated results for the three years ended september 30 2018

 



 

 

nongaap measures 

we report our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us “ gaap ” however we have included financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with gaap nongaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to and not as an alternative for our gaap results the nongaap financial measures we present may differ from similarly captioned measures of other companies

we use the nongaap financial measures “adjusted income from continuing operations” and “adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share” management believes these nongaap financial measures provide our board of directors investors potential investors securities analysts and others with useful information to evaluate our performance because the measures exclude restructuring and other costs and other specific items that management believes are not indicative of ongoing operating results we and our board of directors use this information to evaluate our performance relative to other periods we believe that the most directly comparable gaap measures to adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share are income from continuing operations and earnings from continuing operations per diluted share respectively the gaap results in the tables that follow for pretax tax and net of tax are equivalent to the line items “income from continuing operations before income taxes” “income tax benefit expense” and “income from continuing operations” respectively as reported on the consolidated statements of operations

diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 734 in fiscal 2018 compared to 277 in fiscal 2017 and 059 in fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share were 409 262 and 252 in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

set forth below is a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure adjusted earnings from continuing operations per diluted share to earnings from continuing operations per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measure in dollars per share for the periods indicated

 



 

 

the gaap results in the tables below for pretax tax and net of tax are equivalent to the line items “income from continuing operations before income taxes” “income tax benefit expense” and “income from continuing operations” respectively as reported on the consolidated statements of operations set forth below are reconciliations of adjusted income from continuing operations to the most directly comparable gaap measure income from continuing operations for the periods indicated in millions 

 



 



 



 

 

 



 



 

we discuss certain of these charges in more detail in “ note 3 restructuring and other costs ” and “ note 4 retirement plans ” “ note 5 income taxes ” and see “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies — description of business ” 

net sales unaffiliated customers 

net sales in fiscal 2018 increased 14254 million or 96 compared to fiscal 2017 the increase was primarily attributable to increased corrugated packaging segment sales driven by higher selling pricemix and contributions from acquisitions and increased consumer packaging segment sales primarily due to the contribution from acquisitions primarily the mps acquisition these increases in segment sales were partially offset by the absence of net sales from hhb in fiscal 2018 due to the sale of hhb in april 2017 in addition land and development segment sales were lower compared to the prior year period due to the timing of real estate sales as we monetize the portfolio and lower merchandising display sales in the consumer packaging segment

net sales for fiscal 2017 increased 6879 million to 148597 million compared to 141718 million in fiscal 2016 the increase was primarily a result of an increase in corrugated packaging segment sales including the partial period impact of the us corrugated acquisition and the island container acquisition an increase in land and development segment sales due to the accelerated monetization and a net increase in consumer packaging segment sales associated with the mps acquisition and the hannapak acquisition partially offset by factors that included the absence of full year net sales from hhb in fiscal 2017 due to the sale of hhb

the change in net sales by segment is outlined in the “ results of operations — segment data ” section below

cost of goods sold 

cost of goods sold increased to 128912 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 121195 million in fiscal 2017 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 792 in fiscal 2018 compared to 816 in fiscal 2017 the increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily due to increased net sales associated with the impact of acquisitions primarily the mps acquisition and higher levels of cost inflation the primary inflationary items were freight costs chemical costs virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs these factors were partially offset by the absence of costs associated with hhb in fiscal 2018 due to the hhb sale productivity improvements lower recycled fiber costs and decreased land sales cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales also decreased as a result of higher selling prices primarily in our corrugated packaging segment fiscal 2018 and 2017 included 10 million and 265 million respectively for the expensing of inventory steppedup in purchase accounting net of related lifo impact

 

cost of goods sold increased to 121195 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 114132 million in fiscal 2016 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 816 in fiscal 2017 compared to 805 in fiscal 2016 primarily due to cost inflation primarily recycled fiber as well as increased land sales due to the accelerated monetization and the net impact of acquisitions offset by the impact of the hhb sale and other items in addition fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by the several hurricanes these factors were partially offset by synergy and productivity improvements fiscal 2017 and 2016 included 265 million and 81 million for the expensing of inventory steppedup in purchase accounting net of related lifo impact respectively 

we discuss these items in greater detail below in “ results of operations — segment data ” 

selling general and administrative excluding intangible amortization 

selling general and administrative expenses “ sga ” excluding intangible amortization increased 937 million to 14933 million in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 this increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017 and 2018 that were partially offset by the impact of the hhb sale sga as a percentage of sales declined in fiscal 2018 to 92 from 94 in fiscal 2017 in part due to higher selling prices

sga excluding intangible amortization increased 202 million to 13996 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 13794 million in fiscal 2016 due primarily to acquisitions sga excluding intangible amortization as a percentage of sales decreased to 94 in fiscal 2017 compared to 97 in fiscal 2016

selling general and administrative intangible amortization 

sga intangible amortization was 2966 million 2296 million and 2118 million in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the increase in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 was due to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2018 and 2017 notably the mps acquisition the increase in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was due to acquisitions completed in fiscal 2017 as well as the full year impact of the packaging acquisition compared to nine months of impact in fiscal 2016 which were partially offset by the impact of the hhb sale 

multiemployer pension withdrawals 

in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from piumpf and central states and recorded aggregate estimated withdrawal liabilities of 1842 million which includes an estimate of our portion of piumpf’s accumulated funding deficiency since these withdrawal liabilities assume payment over 20 years the liabilities were discounted at a credit adjusted riskfree rate and therefore we will accrete the liability over time with a charge to interest expense see “ note 4 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with the mepps in which we participate ”

pension risk transfer expense 

in fiscal 2016 we used plan assets to settle 25 billion of pension obligations of the plan by purchasing group annuity contracts from prudential this transaction transferred payment responsibility to prudential for retirement benefits owed to approximately 35000 us retirees and their beneficiaries as a result we recorded a noncash charge of 3707 million pretax the settlement reduced our overall us pension obligations and assets by approximately 40 the monthly retirement benefit payment amounts currently received by retirees and their beneficiaries did not change as a result of this transaction those plan participants not included in the transaction remain in the plan and responsibility for payment of their retirement benefits remains with us see “ note 4 retirement plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

pension lump sum settlement expense 

in fiscal 2017 lump sum payments to certain beneficiaries of the plan together with several onetime severance benefit payments out of the plan triggered pension settlement accounting and resulted in a 326 million noncash charge to our earnings the lump sum payments were to certain eligible former employees who were not currently receiving a monthly benefit eligible former employees whose present value of future pension benefits exceeded a certain minimum threshold had the option to either voluntarily accept lump sum payments or to not accept the offer and continue to be entitled to their monthly benefit upon retirement see “ note 4 retirement plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

 

land and development impairments 

in fiscal 2018 we recorded 319 million of pretax noncash impairments of certain mineral rights and real estate the 236 million impairment of mineral rights was driven by the nonrenewal of a lease and the other 83 million was recorded to writedown the carrying value on real estate projects similarly in fiscal 2017 we recorded a pretax noncash real estate impairment of 467 million or 397 million net of 70 million of noncontrolling interest due to the accelerated monetization in our land and development segment the real estate impairments in both years were recorded to writedown the carrying value on projects where the projected sales proceeds were less than the carrying value the charge is not reflected in segment income 

restructuring and other costs 

we recorded aggregate pretax restructuring and other costs of 1054 million 1967 million and 3664 million for fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively we generally expect the integration of a closed facility’s assets and production with other facilities to enable the receiving facilities to better leverage their fixed costs while eliminating fixed costs from the closed facility costs recorded in each period are not comparable since the timing and scope of the individual actions associated with each restructuring acquisition divestiture or integration vary the restructuring and other costs exclude the specialty chemicals costs which are included in discontinued operations in fiscal 2016 see “ note 3 restructuring and other costs ” and “ note 7 discontinued operations ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information including a description of the type of costs incurred we have restructured portions of our operations from time to time and it is possible that we may engage in additional restructuring opportunities in the future see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur additional restructuring costs and may not realize expected benefits from restructuring ” 

interest expense net 

interest expense net was 2938 million 2225 million and 2125 million for fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively interest expense net in fiscal 2018 increased primarily due to debt incurred as a result of acquisitions in fiscal 2017 and 2018 as well as an increase in market interest rates the increase in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to debt incurred as a result of acquisitions interest expense net in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 was reduced by 310 million 345 million and 445 million respectively related to the amortization of the fair value of debt steppedup in purchase accounting during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 amortization of debt issuance costs charged to interest expense net were 63 million 45 million and 46 million respectively see item 1a “ risk factors — the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ” 

other income net 

other income net was 127 million 115 million and 144 million in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively other income net in fiscal 2018 included a 123 million gain on the sale of our solid waste management brokerage services business other income net in fiscal 2017 primarily included income from the sale of certain investments other income net in fiscal 2016 included a 121 million gain on investment in grupo gondi related to the three corrugated box plants we contributed to the joint venture

gain on sale of hhb 

on april 6 2017 we announced that we had completed the hhb sale in fiscal 2017 we recorded a pretax gain on sale of 1928 million we used the proceeds from the hhb sale in connection with the mps acquisition 

provision for income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act hr 1 the “ tax act ”  the tax act contains significant changes to corporate taxation including i the reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 ii the acceleration of expensing for certain business assets iii the onetime transition tax related to the transition of us international tax from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system iv the repeal of the domestic production deduction v additional limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and vi expanded limitations on executive compensation the key impacts of the tax act on our financial statements in fiscal 2018 were the remeasurement of deferred tax balances to the new 

 

corporate tax rate and an accrual for the onetime transition tax liability see “ note 5 income taxes — impacts of the tax act ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we recorded income tax benefit from continuing operations of 8745 million at an effective tax rate benefit of 845 in fiscal 2018 including the 11288 million provisional benefit of the tax act as compared to income tax expense from continuing operations of 1590 million at an effective tax rate of 185 in fiscal 2017 and compared to an income tax expense from continuing operations of 898 million at an effective tax rate expense of 367 in fiscal 2016

 

the effective tax rate benefit from continuing operations for fiscal 2018 was lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to i the provisional amounts related to the enactment of the tax act ii favorable tax items such as the domestic production deduction tax benefit of sharebased compensation and cash tax planning that resulted in reduced deferred tax liabilities iii true up of certain deferred taxes and foreign tax returns and iv a change in valuation allowance partially offset by v the inclusion of state taxes and vi the exclusion of tax benefits related to losses recorded by certain foreign operations

the effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2017 was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to i low rates of tax applicable to the hhb sale ii a 287 million tax benefit related to the reduction of a state deferred tax liability as a result of an internal us legal entity restructuring that simplified future operating activities within the us iii favorable tax items such as the domestic manufacturer’s deduction iv lower tax rates applied to foreign earnings primarily in canada and v a change in valuation allowance due to realization of capital loss carryforward partially offset by vi the exclusion of tax benefits related to losses recorded by certain foreign operations and vii the inclusion of state taxes

the effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2016 was different than the statutory rate primarily due to i the impact of state taxes ii the ability to claim the domestic manufacturer’s deduction against us taxable earnings iii the deconsolidation of a subsidiary related to the grupo gondi joint venture including nondeductible goodwill disposed of in connection with the transaction and iv an increase in valuation allowances and a tax rate differential with respect to foreign earnings primarily in canada

see “ note 5 income taxes ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

loss from discontinued operations 

on may 15 2016 we completed the separation subsequent to the separation the operating results of our former specialty chemicals segment are reported as discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations net of tax was 5447 million for fiscal 2016 as a result of goodwill and intangible impairments and restructuring and other costs being partially offset by income from operations

in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 in light of changing market conditions expected revenue and earnings of the reporting unit lower comparative market valuations for companies in specialty chemicals’ peer group and the results of our preliminary “step 2” test we concluded that an impairment of the specialty chemicals reporting unit was probable and could be reasonably estimated as a result we recorded a pretax and aftertax noncash goodwill impairment charge of 4783 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 in conjunction with the separation we performed an impairment assessment under the held for sale model and recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 1011 million for a customer relationships intangible see “ note 7 discontinued operations ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

net sales aggregate — corrugated packaging segment 

net sales before intersegment elimination for the corrugated packaging segment increased 6951 million in the fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to 6835 million of higher corrugated selling pricemix and 1567 million of higher corrugated volumes including acquisitions which were partially offset by 845 million of lower net sales from our recycling operations primarily due to lower recycled fiber prices 362 million of unfavorable foreign currency impacts and 244 million of other items primarily due to the deconsolidation of a foreign joint venture in fiscal 2017 

net sales before intersegment eliminations for the corrugated packaging segment increased 5398 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to 3218 million of higher corrugated selling pricemix 1439 million of higher net sales of our recycling operations primarily due to higher recycled fiber prices 982 million of higher corrugated volumes including acquisitions and 559 million of favorable foreign currency impacts these increases were partially offset by an estimated 450 million decrease due to the impact of several hurricanes in fiscal 2017 and a net 422 million of lower corrugated net sales due to a shift in sales from converted boxes in the prior year period to sales of containerboard in fiscal 2017 as a result of having contributed three box plants to the grupo gondi joint venture in april 2016

segment income — corrugated packaging segment

segment income attributable to the corrugated packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased 4540 million compared to fiscal 2017 primarily due to an estimated 5298 million of higher corrugated selling pricemix an estimated 1107 million of productivity improvements and 252 million of higher corrugated volumes including acquisitions these increases were partially offset by an estimated 789 million of increased depreciation and amortization 522 million for the net impact of cost inflation and an estimated 806 million of other items including 204 million of lower contributions from our recycling operations driven by lower recycled fiber costs an estimated 190 million impact of startup issues following major maintenance outages partially offset by a 95 million lower asset retirement obligations adjustment than in the prior year the net impact of cost inflation included lower recycled fiber costs that were more than offset by higher freight costs chemical costs virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs compared to the prior year the increased depreciation and amortization was primarily a function of acquisitions capital investments and 171 million of increased sga intangible amortization due to acquisitions and included 270 million of accelerated depreciation associated with assets being replaced due to projects to install a 330” stateoftheart kraft linerboard machine at our florence south carolina mill and to build a new corrugated box plant in the brazilian state of sao paulo 

segment income attributable to the corrugated packaging segment in fiscal 2017 increased 140 million to 7539 million compared to 7399 million in fiscal 2016 the increase was primarily due to an estimated 2854 million of favorable selling pricemix 1544 million of synergy and productivity improvements and 210 million of favorable corrugated volumes including acquisitions these factors were largely offset by an estimated 3800 million of cost inflation the impact of several hurricanes and legal charges that reduced segment income by an estimated 404 million and higher depreciation and amortization of 183 million the primary inflation resulted from materials energy freight and wage and other costs 

 

consumer packaging segment 

consumer packaging shipments 

consumer packaging shipments are expressed as a tons equivalent which includes external and intersegment tons shipped from our consumer packaging mills plus consumer packaging converting shipments converted from bsf to tons the shipment data table excludes dispensing sales prior to the april 6 2017 hhb sale and merchandising displays since there is not a common unit of measure as well as gypsum paperboard liner tons produced by seven hills since it is not consolidated 

 



 

 

consumer packaging segment 

 



 



net sales aggregate — consumer packaging segment

net sales before intersegment eliminations for the consumer packaging segment increased 8389 million in fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the 11431 million increase in net sales from acquisitions primarily the mps acquisition and 666 million of higher selling pricemix partially offset by the absence of net sales from hhb which totaled 2976 million in the prior year period due to the hhb sale and 711 million of lower volumes the volume decline primarily reflects lower sales of merchandising displays and lower pulp shipments

net sales before intersegment eliminations for the consumer packaging segment increased 644 million in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of 5751 million of aggregate net sales from the mps acquisition the packaging acquisition and the hannapak acquisition which were largely offset by 1885 million of lower volumes a 2768 million decrease in net sales related to the absence of net sales from hhb since april 2017 261 million of unfavorable selling pricemix and an estimated 200 million decrease due to the impact of several hurricanes in fiscal 2017

segment income — consumer packaging segment

 

segment income attributable to the consumer packaging segment in fiscal 2018 increased 288 million compared to the prior year period primarily due to an estimated 1406 million of productivity improvements an increase of 605 million of segment income related to the mps acquisition 305 million of lower depreciation and amortization excluding the mps acquisition an estimated 316 million of higher selling pricemix and a 201 million favorable acquisition reserve adjustments all of which were largely offset by an estimated 1781 million of cost inflation 388 million related to the absence of income from hhb 167 million for the impact of lower volumes compared to the prior year period and other items the net impact of cost inflation included lower recycled fiber that was more than offset by higher freight costs chemical costs virgin fiber costs and wage and other costs compared to the prior year period consumer packaging segment income in fiscal 2017 was reduced by 251 million of acquisition inventory stepup expense primarily related to the mps acquisition

 

segment income attributable to the consumer packaging segment in fiscal 2017 decreased 559 million compared to fiscal 2016 primarily due to an estimated 1692 million of cost inflation 502 million for the impact of lower volumes the 257 million impact of lower income from hhb in fiscal 2017 as compared to the full year in fiscal 2016 a 204 million increase in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 for the expensing of inventory steppedup in purchase accounting primarily related to the mps acquisition in fiscal 2017 and the packaging acquisition in fiscal 2016 an estimated 122 million related to the impact of several hurricanes in fiscal 2017 and 88 million of lower selling pricemix these factors were partially offset by synergy and productivity improvements of an estimated 2038 million a 294 million contribution from the operations acquired in the mps acquisition prior to expensing 247 million of inventory stepup and 153 million of lower depreciation and amortization expense the lower depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a 101 million pretax benefit from ceasing recording depreciation and amortization expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 in hhb since it was designated as held for sale the primary inflation resulted from materials energy freight and wage and other costs 

land and development segment 

 



 



net sales aggregate — land and development segment

net sales for the land and development segment in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 were 1424 million 2438 million and 1198 million respectively the decrease in fiscal 2018 and the increase in fiscal 2017 were due to the timing of land sales as we monetize the portfolio we include the remainder of the real estate holdings in assets held for sale because we have met the held for sale criteria we expect to complete the monetization of these holdings during fiscal 2019 after we complete the monetization the segment will cease to exist

segment income loss — land and development segment

segment income attributable to the land and development segment was 225 million 138 million and 46 million in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the segment’s assets were steppedup to fair value in fiscal 2015 as a result of purchase accounting which resulted in substantially lower margins on the properties sold compared to earlier levels the pretax noncash impairments of certain mineral rights and real estate discussed above under the caption “ land and development impairments ” are not included in segment income

our capital expenditures aggregated 9999 million in fiscal 2018 we expect fiscal 2019 capital expenditures to be approximately 15 billion including kapstone and investments to restore operations our panama city fl mill following hurricane michael our base capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 should be approximately 950 million to 10 billion with roughly half invested in maintenance and half invested in high return generating projects in fiscal 2019 we expect to invest approximately 05 billion in strategic projects the strategic projects include i installation of a 330” stateoftheart kraft linerboard machine at our florence sc mill ii an upgrade of the tres barras mill that will add virgin pulping capacity a biomass power boiler a turbine generator and other equipment iii construction of a new corrugated box plant in the brazilian state of sao paulo iv installation of a curtain coater at our mahrt al mill and v installation of a headbox and upgrade of other areas of a paper machine at our covington va mill however it is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions may change project completion dates may change or we may decide to invest a different amount depending upon opportunities we identify changes in market conditions or to comply with environmental or other regulatory changes we estimate that we will invest approximately 22 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2019 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance excluding kapstone we were obligated to purchase approximately 203 million of fixed assets at september 30 2018 for various capital projects see item 1a “ risk factors — our capital expenditures may not achieve the desired outcomes or may be achieved at a higher cost than anticipated ” 

at september 30 2018 the us federal state and foreign net operating losses and state tax credits available to us aggregated approximately 117 million in future potential reductions of us federal state and foreign cash taxes based on our current projections we expect to utilize the remaining us federal net operating losses and other us federal credits primarily over the next two years foreign and state net operating losses and credits will be used over a longer period of time it is possible that our utilization of these net operating losses and credits may change due to changes in taxable income tax laws or tax rates capital expenditures or other factors fiscal 2018 is the last year in which we will receive a tax benefit from the domestic production deduction including the estimated impact of book and tax differences subject to changes in tax laws we expect our cash tax rate to move closer to our income tax rate in fiscal 2019 2020 and 2021

during fiscal 2018 and 2017 we made contributions of 377 million and 345 million respectively to our us and nonus pension plans based on current facts and assumptions we expect to contribute approximately 22 million to our us and nonus pension plans in fiscal 2019 we have made contributions and expect to continue to make contributions in the coming years to our pension plans in order to ensure that our funding levels remain adequate in light of projected liabilities and to meet the requirements of the pension act and other regulations the net over funded status of our us and nonus pension plans at september 30 2018 was 1477 million based on current assumptions including future interest rates we estimate that minimum pension contributions to our us and nonus pension plans will be in the range of approximately 25 million to 27 million annually in fiscal 2020 

 

through 2023 see “ note 4 retirement plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also item 1a “ risk factors — certain of our pension plans will likely require additional cash contributions ” 

in the normal course of business we evaluate our potential exposure to mepps including with respect to potential withdrawal liabilities in fiscal 2018 we submitted formal notification to withdraw from two plans and recorded an aggregate estimated withdrawal liability of 1842 million see “ note 4 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information see also item 1a “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with the mepps in which we participate ” 

in october 2018 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0455 per share representing a 58 increase from the prior 043 per share quarterly dividend and an annual dividend of 182 per share during fiscal 2018 we paid an annual dividend of 172 per share during fiscal 2017 we paid an annual dividend of 160 per share during fiscal 2016 we paid an annual dividend of 150 per share

in july 2015 our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to 400 million shares of our common stock representing approximately 15 of our outstanding common stock as of july 1 2015 shares of our common stock may be purchased from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions the timing manner price and amount of repurchases will be determined by management at its discretion based on factors including the market price of our common stock general economic and market conditions and applicable legal requirements the repurchase program may be commenced suspended or discontinued at any time in fiscal 2018 we repurchased approximately 34 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 1951 million in fiscal 2017 we repurchased approximately 18 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 930 million in fiscal 2016 we repurchased approximately 81 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 3353 million as of september 30 2018 we had remaining authorization under the repurchase program authorized in july 2015 to purchase approximately 213 million shares of our common stock

contractual obligations 

we summarize our enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations at september 30 2018 and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in the following table certain amounts in this table are based on management’s estimates and assumptions about these obligations including their duration the possibility of renewal anticipated actions by third parties and other factors including estimated minimum pension plan contributions and estimated benefit payments related to postretirement obligations supplemental retirement plans and deferred compensation plans because these estimates and assumptions are subjective the enforceable and legally binding obligations we actually pay in future periods may vary from those presented in the table 

 



 

















in addition to the enforceable and legally binding obligations presented in the table above we have other obligations for goods and services and raw materials entered into in the normal course of business these contracts however are subject to change based on our business decisions

expenditures for environmental compliance

see item 1 “ business — governmental regulation — environmental and other matters ” “ business — governmental regulation — cercla and other remediation costs ” and “ business — governmental regulation — climate change ” for a discussion of our expenditures for environmental compliance

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues expenses assets and liabilities reported certain critical accounting matters are described in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also item 7a “ quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ” these critical accounting matters are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require some of management’s most subjective and complex judgments the accounting for these matters involves the making of estimates based on current facts circumstances and assumptions that in management’s judgment could change in a manner that would materially affect management’s future estimates with respect to such matters and accordingly could cause our future reported financial condition and results to differ materially from those that we are currently reporting based on management’s current estimates

critical accounting matters discussed in “ note 1 description of business and summary of significant accounting policies ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements include i accounts receivable and allowances ii goodwill and longlived assets iii restructuring and other costs iv business combinations v fair value of financial instruments and nonfinancial assets and liabilities vi income taxes and vii pension and other postretirement benefits

accounts receivable and allowances

we have an allowance for doubtful accounts credits returns and allowances and cash discounts that serve to reduce the value of our gross accounts receivable to the amount we estimate we will ultimately collect the allowances contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding our customers’ credit worthiness and the credits returns and allowances and cash discounts that may be taken by our customers we derive our accounts receivable from revenue earned from customers located primarily in north america south america europe asia and australia given our diverse customer base we have limited exposure to credit loss from any particular customer or industry segment and hence we generally do not require collateral in connection with engaging in commercial transactions with them we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the particular customer’s current credit worthiness as determined by our review of their current financial information we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our customers’ financial condition our collection experience and any other relevant customer specific information our assessment of this and other information forms the basis of our allowances we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate the allowances however while these credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions we established it is possible that our credit loss rates could be higher or lower in the future depending on changes in business conditions and changes in our customers’ credit worthiness at september 30 2018 our accounts receivable net of allowances of 497 million was 20107 million a 1 additional loss on accounts receivable would change our allowance by 201 million and a 5 change in our allowance assumptions would change our allowance by 25 million

goodwill

we review the carrying value of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair value we determine recoverability by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill applies to the carrying value including goodwill of that reporting unit we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method or as appropriate a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the guideline public company method our discounted cash flow analysis is based on the sum of two components the present value of our projected cash flows and the present value of a terminal value the cash flow estimates are derived from our current forecast and our longterm forecasts prepared for each reporting unit considering historical results and anticipated future performance and capital expenditures and require considerable judgment the discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis utilizing a beta derived from peer companies in addition we gave consideration in the calculation of the weighted average cost of capital for equity risks including size risk industry risk and country specific risk as appropriate for each of our reporting units as a result of the weighted average cost of capital calculations the 

 

discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 80 to 135 we use perpetual growth rates in the reporting units that have goodwill ranging from 05 to 10 the guideline public company method involves comparing the reporting unit to similar companies whose stock is freely traded on an organized exchange the fair values determined by the discounted cash flow and guideline public company methods were weighted to arrive at the concluded fair value of the reporting unit however in instances where comparisons to our peers was less meaningful no weight was placed on the guideline public company method to arrive at the concluded fair value of the reporting unit 

estimating the fair value of the reporting unit involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs capital expenditures industry economic factors and future business strategy the variability of the factors that management uses to perform the goodwill impairment test depends on a number of conditions including uncertainty about future events and cash flows including anticipated changes in revenues and costs and synergies and productivity improvements resulting from the acquisitions capital expenditures and continuous improvement projects these factors are interdependent and therefore do not change in isolation accordingly our accounting estimates may materially change from period to period due to changing market factors if we had used other assumptions and estimates or if conditions change in future periods our operating results could be materially impacted any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these reporting units and their prospects such as changes in our strategy or products the loss of key customers regulatory changes or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a change in the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 of those reporting units that have goodwill our consumer packaging reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 primarily due to the fair value accounting related to the combination and the mps acquisition if we had concluded that it was appropriate to increase the discount rate we used by 100 basis points to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill the fair value of each of our reporting units would have continued to exceed its carrying value except for the consumer packaging reporting unit the consumer packaging reporting unit had 36109 million of goodwill at september 30 2018 no events have occurred since the latest annual goodwill impairment assessment that would necessitate an interim goodwill impairment assessment we have not made any material changes to our impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or estimates we use to calculate impairment losses however if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material 

see item 1a “ risk factors — we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and a write down would adversely impact our operating results and shareholders’ equity ”  

accounting for income taxes

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available evidence including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income tax planning strategies and recent operations significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations a 1 change in our effective tax rate would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately 103 million for fiscal 2018 a 1 change in our effective tax rate used to compute deferred tax liabilities and assets as recorded on the september 30 2018 consolidated balance sheet would increase or decrease tax expense by approximately 975 million for fiscal 2018

pension and other postretirement benefits

the funded status of our qualified and nonqualified us and nonus pension plans increased 692 million in fiscal 2018 our us qualified and nonqualified pension and nonus pension plans were over funded by 1377 million and 100 million respectively as of september 30 2018 our us pension plan benefit obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2018 primarily by a 41basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date the nonus pension plan obligations were positively impacted in fiscal 2018 by a 16basis point increase in the discount rate compared to the prior measurement date a 25basis point change in the discount rate compensation level expected longterm rate of return on plan assets or medical cost trend factoring in our 

 

corridor as appropriate would have had the following effect on fiscal 2018 pension and other postretirement expense amounts in the table in parentheses reflect additional income in millions

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk from changes in among other things interest rates foreign currencies and commodity prices we aim to identify and understand these risks and then implement strategies to manage them when evaluating these strategies we evaluate the fundamentals of each market our sensitivity to movements in pricing and underlying accounting and business implications to implement these strategies we may enter into various hedging transactions the sensitivity analyses we present below do not consider the effect of possible adverse changes in the general economy nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes we may not be successful in managing these risks

containerboard and paperboard shipments

we are exposed to market risk related to our sales of containerboard and paperboard we sell a significant portion of our mill production and converted products pursuant to contracts that provide that prices are either fixed for specified terms or provide for price adjustments based on negotiated terms including changes in specified index prices we have the capacity to annually ship approximately 93 million tons in our corrugated packaging segment and approximately 42 million tons in our consumer packaging segment although our mill system operating rates may vary from year to year due to changes in market and other factors our simple average mill system operating rates for the last three years averaged 96 a hypothetical 10 per ton decrease in the price of containerboard and paperboard throughout the year based on our capacity would decrease our sales by approximately 93 million and 42 million in our corrugated packaging and consumer packaging segments respectively see item 1a “ risk factors — our earnings are highly dependent on volumes ” 

energy

energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations the cost of natural gas coal oil electricity diesel and wood byproducts biomass at times have fluctuated significantly in our recycled paperboard mills we use primarily natural gas and electricity supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and at a few mills to generate electricity used on site in our virgin fiber mills we use biomass natural gas and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site we primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities we generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates

we spent approximately 739 million on all energy sources in fiscal 2018 to operate our facilities natural gas accounted for nearly half approximately 76 million mmbtu of our total energy purchases in fiscal 2018 a hypothetical 10 increase in the price of energy throughout the year would increase our cost of energy by approximately 74 million based on fiscal 2018 pricing and consumption

recycled fiber

recycled fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of recycled paperboard and a portion of our containerboard we consume approximately 48 million tons of recycled fiber per year our purchases of old 

 

corrugated containers and doublelined kraft clippings accounted for our largest recycled fiber costs and approximately 85 to 90 of our recycled fiber purchases the remaining 10 to 15 of our recycled fiber purchases consisted of a number of other grades of recycled paper the mix of recycled fiber may vary due to factors such as market demand availability and pricing a hypothetical 10 increase in recycled fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately 75 million 

virgin fiber

virgin fiber is the principal raw material we use in the production of a portion of our containerboard bleached paperboard and market pulp a hypothetical 10 increase in virgin fiber prices in our mills for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately 117 million

freight

inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us factors that influence our freight expense are items such as distance between our shipping and delivery locations distance from customers and suppliers mode of transportation rail truck intermodal and ocean and freight rates which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs primarily diesel we experienced significantly higher freight costs in fiscal 2018 as transportation companies raised prices to address a shortage of drivers and strong demand a hypothetical 10 increase for a fiscal year would increase our costs by approximately 150 million of which approximately onefifth would be the portion related to higher diesel costs based on our estimated 77 million gallons consumed annually see item 1a “ risk factors — we may face increased costs or inadequate availability of raw materials energy and transportation ” 

interest rates

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our shortterm and longterm debt we may from time to time use interest rate swap agreements to manage the interest rate characteristics of a portion of our outstanding debt based on the amounts and mix of our fixed and floating rate debt at september 30 2018 if market interest rates increase an average of 100 basis points our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 10 million we determined these amounts by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing costs this analysis does not consider the effects of changes in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment see item 1a “ risk factors — the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business ”

we periodically may issue and settle foreign currency denominated debt exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates on open balances at each balance sheet date from time to time we may use foreign exchange contracts to hedge these exposures with terms of generally one month based on our open foreign exchange contracts as of september 30 2018 the effect of a 1 change in exchange rates would impact other income by approximately 4 million although these foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the foreign currency denominated debt exposures the fluctuation of these instruments may cause future cash settlement of the hedge

pension plans

our pension plans are influenced by trends in the financial markets and the regulatory environment among other factors adverse general stock market trends and falling interest rates increase plan costs and liabilities during fiscal 2018 the effect of a 025 decrease in the discount rate would have reduced pretax income by approximately 11 million and a 025 increase in the discount rate would have increased pretax income by 11 million during fiscal 2017 the effect of a 025 decrease in the discount rate would have reduced pretax income by approximately 11 million and a 025 increase in the discount rate would have increased pretax income by 8 million similarly mepps in which we participate could experience similar circumstances which could impact our funding requirements and therefore expenses see “ note 4 retirement plans — multiemployer plans ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements see also item 1a “ risk factors —certain of our pension plans will likely require additional cash contributions ” and “ risk factors — we may incur withdrawal liability andor increased funding requirements in connection with the mepps in which we participate ” 

 

foreign currency 

we predominately operate in us markets but derived 199 of our net sales in fiscal 2018 from outside the us through international operations some of which were transacted in us dollars in addition certain of our domestic operations have sales to foreign customers in conducting our foreign operations we also make intercompany sales and receive royalties and dividends denominated in different currencies these activities expose us to the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates flows of foreign currencies into and out of our operations are generally stable and regularly occurring and are recorded at fair market value in our financial statements our foreign currency management policy permits us to enter into foreign currency hedges when these flows exceed a threshold which is a function of these cash flows and forecasted annual operations

at times certain of our foreign subsidiaries have us dollardenominated external debt in these instances we may hedge the nonfunctional currency exposure with derivatives we issue intercompany loans to and receive foreign cash deposits from our foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies exposing us to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates between loan issue and loan repayment dates and changes in spot exchange rates from deposits from time to time we may use foreignexchange hedge contracts with terms of generally less than one year to hedge these exposures although our derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments expose us to market risk fluctuations in the value of these instruments are mitigated by expected offsetting fluctuations in the matched exposures

during fiscal 2018 and 2017 the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currencies that we have exposure to versus to the us dollar would have impacted our segment results by approximately 36 million and 26 million respectively see “ note 6 segment information ” of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

during fiscal 2018 and 2017 the effect of a 1 change in exchange rates would have impacted accumulated other comprehensive income by approximately 37 million and 34 million respectively this impact does not consider the effects of a stronger or weaker dollar on our ability to compete for export business or the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment changes in foreign exchange rates could impact the price and the demand for our products see item 1a “ risk factors — we may be adversely affected by factors that are beyond our control such as us and worldwide economic and financial market conditions and social and political change ”
