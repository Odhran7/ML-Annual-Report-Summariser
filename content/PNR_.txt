information regarding all reportable segments 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities these efforts consist mostly of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes 

raw materials 

the principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are mild steel stainless steel electronic components including motors plastics resins fiberglass epoxies copper and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution for resale 

we purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources supplier capabilities were stressed in 2021 compared to previous years as a result of the unstable situation brought on by the novel coronavirus 2019 “covid19” pandemic reduced labor availability and the shortage of electronic components and other raw materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and continue to work with our suppliers to maintain delivery continuity alternate sources of supply are available for most materials and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain commodities such as metals and resins are subject to commodity market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances prices for raw materials such as metals resins and electronics may trend higher in the near future due to the existing inflationary market trends

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document 

risks relating to our business 

the covid19 pandemic may have a material negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and financial results have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic and its repercussions the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic is uncertain rapidly changing and hard to predict in 2021 and 2020 the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and our business and it may negatively impact our business in numerous ways including but not limited to those outlined below 

• deteriorating economic and political conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic such as increased unemployment decreases in capital spending declines in consumer confidence or economic slowdowns or recessions could cause a decrease in demand for our products 

• due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in customer demand for certain products and in certain endmarkets 

• our workforce may be unable or unwilling to work onsite or travel as a result of the continuing pandemic and related vaccine requirements event cancellations facility closures shelterinplace travel and other restrictions and changes in industry practice or if they their coworkers or their family members become ill or otherwise require care arrangements regulations for vaccines and covid19 testing have been announced and additional regulations may be announced in the jurisdictions in which our businesses operate implementation of new regulations for vaccines may result in attrition of professional and skilled labor and impact our ability to attract and retain talent necessary for our business operations these measures also may impact our ability to meet production demands or requests and may delay our new product introductions depending on employee attendance or ability to continue to work in addition we have experienced disruptions at some of our facilities with higher absenteeism due to the covid19 pandemic 

• if the covid19 pandemic continues and economic conditions worsen we may experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities customer orders and our collections of accounts receivable which could be material and it remains uncertain the impact on future operational and commercial activities customer orders and collections even if economic conditions improve 

• government or regulatory responses to the covid19 pandemic have and may continue to negatively impact our business during 2021 and 2020 mandatory lockdowns or other restrictions on operations in some countries temporarily disrupted our ability to manufacture or distribute our products in some of these markets a reoccurrence of these disruptions could materially adversely impact our operations and results in addition to existing travel restrictions jurisdictions may continue to close borders impose increased vaccine or testing requirements prolong quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity and other related supply chain delays may develop which could significantly impact our ability to support our operations and customers meet demand develop new products ship our backlog and also impact the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to produce products and services or significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain 

• the impacts of the covid19 pandemic may limit our ability to reduce our overall operating costs we have experienced increased costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic through among other things our continued measures taken to protect our employees’ health and wellbeing 

• the increase in demand as the covid19 pandemic has stabilized or waned has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our operations global supply chain and routes to market andor those of our suppliers andor their suppliers these disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them have increased and may continue to increase product logistics or labor costs limit availability of raw materials or cause delays in delivering our backlog or may cause an inability to deliver products to our customers or meet customer demand 

• while we have experienced high demand in our pool business as consumers have spent more time at home as a result of the covid19 pandemic that contributed to growth in our sales during 2021 and 2020 such growth may not be sustainable and may not be repeated in future periods furthermore even if growth in demand continues we may not be able to meet that demand due to supply production capacity andor labor challenges 

• disruptions or uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in delays or modifications to some of our strategic plans and initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our growth targets 

• actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in legal investigations or claims regulatory actions or litigation against us 

we may not be able to predict or respond to all impacts of the covid19 pandemic on a timely basis to prevent near or longterm adverse impacts to our results due to the speed with which the covid19 situation continues to develop the global breadth of its spread and the range of governmental and community reactions thereto there is uncertainty around its duration and severity and ultimate impact actions taken by parties other than us to respond to the pandemic and the impact of virus variants and the effectiveness of vaccines to address the covid19 virus and variants therefore any negative impact on our business financial condition including without limitation our liquidity results of operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but the covid19 pandemic could lead to extended disruption of economic activity and the impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be material the foregoing and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below and any of these impacts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial commercial and residential markets we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and results of operations due to economic and business cycles in particular during 2021 we had higher than anticipated demand in our pool business and certain of our residential and commercial businesses such demand may not be sustainable and may not be repeated in future periods important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the global economy and various regional economies and our customers’ confidence in these economies industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of residential and commercial real estate markets residential housing markets the commercial business climate unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates inflation rates and energy and commodity prices the businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of the above factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could reduce demand for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies regional and local companies diversified and pureplay companies and lower cost manufacturers competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with ours we compete based on technical expertise intellectual property reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms service offerings customer experience and service and price some of our competitors attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price moreover demand for our products which impacts profit margins is affected by changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases adoption of new technology and connected products and changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors customer purchasing behavior may also shift by product mix in the market or result in a shift to new distribution channels including ecommerce which is a rapidly developing area if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and solutions or adapt to changes in customer purchasing behavior or shifts in distribution channels or if we are forced to change prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to transform and adapt our products services solutions and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses in addition we need to be flexible to adapt our products to ever changing customer preferences including those relating to regulatory climate change and social responsibility matters accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to transform and adapt our products services solutions organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target end markets and develop or acquire competitive technologies products services and solutions and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively the failure to effectively adapt our products services or solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to identify finance and complete suitable acquisitions and investments and any completed acquisitions and investments may be unsuccessful or consume significant resources 

our business strategy includes acquiring businesses and making investments that complement our existing businesses we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product service and solution offerings we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain financing or have sufficient cash necessary for acquisitions or successfully complete acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of management time and attention from daily operations 

• difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business 

• difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses 

• inability to obtain required regulatory approvals 

• potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of ours 

• assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and 

• dilution of interests of holders of our shares through the issuance of equity securities or equitylinked securities 

it may be difficult for us to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions or investments may not be successful or realize the intended benefits and may ultimately result in impairment charges or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our business initiatives 

during 2021 2020 and 2019 we initiated and continued execution of certain business initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business during 2021 we also launched and committed resources to a program designed to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion through transformation of our business model to drive operational excellence reduce complexity and streamline our processes as a result we have incurred and expect to continue to incur in the future substantial expense including transformation costs that include professional services project management and related design and execution charges as well as costs related to both labor and nonlabor restructuring and it investments and restructuring charges we may not be able to achieve accelerated growth and margin expansion or operating efficiencies to reduce costs or realize benefits that we anticipated in connection with these initiatives if we are unable to execute these initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  

we may experience cost and other inflation 

during 2021 we experienced inflationary cost increases of raw materials such as metals resins and electronics including drives and motors as well as increases in logistics and labor costs and we expect inflationary cost increases to continue in 2022 we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals resins and electronics logistics energy and other costs including wages pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs however these actions may not be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity and we anticipate inflation to continue with respect to materials especially resins copper steel stainless steel and electronics as well as labor and logistics continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to increase prices generate cost savings or improve productivity could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability 

during 2021 we experienced supply chain challenges including increased lead times for raw materials due to availability constraints and high demand while we have elevated our engagement with our suppliers and used secondary suppliers and new methods of procurement where available to mitigate the supply chain pressures we expect supply chain challenges to continue in 2022 any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of the supply of raw materials and components due to the casualty loss of any of our manufacturing plants interruptions in service by our thirdparty logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels unexpected delays in shipping or processing through customs of goods trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions or other unexpected or uncontrollable events that cause a material interruption in our supply chain such as pandemics social or labor unrest natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts could negatively affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability additionally our raw materials and components are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners we rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner may be a challenge especially with respect to raw materials and components sourced from outside the us and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest for certain products we may rely on one or very few suppliers a suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control in addition our competitors may be less reliant on third party suppliers than we are which may give such competitors more control over their supply chain and lead times for manufacturing products these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to political regulatory economic trade and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2021 accounted for 32 of our net sales further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from nonus suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic trade and other risks that are inherent in operating in and purchasing from numerous countries these risks include 

• changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets 

• relatively more severe economic conditions in some international markets than in the us 

• the imposition of sanctions tariffs duties exchange controls currency restrictions or other trade restrictions 

• changes in tax treaties laws or rulings that could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through nonus legal systems 

• the difficulty of communicating and monitoring evolving standards and directives across our product lines services and global facilities 

• the difficulty of ensuring that our products services and supply chains meet everchanging regional regulations and requirements 

• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions 

• the possibility of terrorist action affecting us or our operations 

• the threat of nationalization and expropriation 

• changes due to nationalist consumer sentiment 

• the difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in nonus labor markets 

• limitations on repatriation of earnings or other regionallyimposed capital requirements 

• the difficulty of protecting intellectual property in nonus countries and 

• changes in and required compliance with a variety of nonus laws and regulations some of which may be incompatible 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

changes in us or foreign government administrative policy including changes to existing trade agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 

as a result of changes to us or foreign government administrative policy there may be changes to existing trade agreements greater restrictions on free trade generally significant increases in tariffs on goods including those imported into the us particularly tariffs on products manufactured in mexico china or other countries where we purchase have operations or manufacture or sell products prohibitions or restrictions on doing business with certain entities including those with certain relationships with china and adverse responses by foreign governments to us trade policy among other possible changes it remains unclear what the us administration or foreign governments including china will or will not do with respect to tariffs or international trade agreements and policies a trade war other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently purchase have operations or manufacture and sell products and any resulting negative sentiments towards the us as a result of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage furthermore our business strategy also includes expanding our smart products and internet of things offerings and there are many other companies that hold patents in this space over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets including competitors to use challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant as of december 31 2021 our goodwill and intangible assets were 2933 million and represented 62 of our total assets declines in fair market value could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 

a loss of or material cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by or delivery of products to one or more of our largest customers could harm our business 

our net sales to our largest customer represented approximately 20 of our consolidated net sales in 2021 while we do not have any other customers that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales in 2021 we have other customers that are key to the success of our business our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of larger customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business our success is dependent on retaining these customers which requires us to successfully manage relationships and anticipate the needs of our customers in the channels in which we sell our products our customers also may be impacted by economic conditions in the industries of those customers which could result in reduced demand for or a delay in purchases of our products in addition our customers may cancel orders for purchases of our products or may not order products at rates consistent with past order levels in addition we may not be able to timely deliver products to our largest customers due to supply chain interruptions or otherwise we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain our largest customers in addition some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by or delivery of products to these customers or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

catastrophic and other events beyond our control may disrupt operations at our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers which could cause us to be unable to meet customer demands or increase our costs or reduce customer spending 

if operations at any of our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters earthquakes power outages fires explosions terrorism adverse weather conditions labor disputes public health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic or other catastrophic events or disruptions outside of our control we may be unable to fill customer orders and otherwise meet customer demand for our products in particular our pool business operations in north carolina and california are in areas that are more susceptible to natural disasters such as hurricanes wildfires and earthquakes in addition these types of events may negatively impact residential commercial and industrial spending in impacted regions or depending on the severity globally as a result any of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we maintain property insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment and to cover business interruption losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand with endcustomers and endusers within each of our business segments demand for pool equipment in the pool business within the consumer solutions segment and residential water supply infrastructure and agricultural products in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august while historically we have attempted to mitigate the magnitude of the sales spike in the pool business and in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts we cannot provide any assurance that should we use such programs in the future they will be successful in addition seasonal effects in the pool business and in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment may vary from year to year and be impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperature heavy flooding and droughts moreover adverse weather conditions such as cold or wet weather may negatively impact demand for and sales of pool equipment in the pool business and residential water supply commercial infrastructure and agricultural products in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment 

our focus on consumer solutions for residential and commercial water treatment as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

as we introduce residential and commercial water treatment solutions we may have limited experience in markets we choose to enter and our customers may not like our value propositions new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results designing marketing and executing these solutions is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises which may be higher than the related revenue 

• the requirement to recruit train and retain qualified personnel 

• increased risk of errors or omissions in the sales or fulfillment of solutions or services 

• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses 

• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes which may increase our scope of liability 

• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to our consumer products services and solutions and related business model including increased exposure to consumer lawsuits and enforcement actions by governmental authorities 

• increased costs of liability insurance to cover risks associated with performing installation and other services 

• the cybersecurity and data protection risks related to the collection and storage of consumer data 

• the engagement of third parties to assist with sales installation or servicing of our products and solutions and the potential responsibility for the actions they take and 

• increased risk of noncompliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these solutions 

these expanded risks increase the complexity of our business and place significant responsibility on our management employees operations systems technical expertise financial resources and internal controls and compliance functions 

volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2021 accounted for 32 of our net sales our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principal nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenue in future periods in addition currency variations could have a material adverse effect on margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the us and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the us 

risks relating to our debt and financial markets 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants including those that limit the amount of our debt which may restrict the operations of our business and our ability to incur additional debt to finance acquisitions our ability to meet the financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital our credit ratings may be downgraded in the future or our interest rates may increase each of which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2021 we had 8941 million of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate if our cash requirements are more than we expect or if we intend to finance acquisitions we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets may become restricted additionally our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded to the extent that our interest rates increase our interest expense will increase which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for products or for customers to purchase products or commence new projects as suppliers and customers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws outside the us could have a material adverse effect on us 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased regulations and scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from negligent reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees customers or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may require selfdisclosure to government agencies and result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations and changes in us government and other applicable sanctions could have a material adverse effect on us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we sell are “dual use” products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to sanctioned entities or to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

we are exposed to environmental laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to us federal state local and nonus laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits many of which are subject to renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that may be required compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot provide assurance that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as a defendant target or a potentially responsible party “prp” in a number of environmental matters relating to our current or former businesses we have disposed of a number of businesses and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers of businesses from us we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring individual or classaction claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by the operations of divested or acquired businesses or other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of remediation and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities could exceed the amount of our current reserves 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials substantially all of which relate to our discontinued operations these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties in addition some cases brought against us involve the presence of asbestos at facilities that we own or used to own each case typically names a large number of product manufacturers service providers and premises owners historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and settling claims before trial only where appropriate as of december 31 2021 there were approximately 670 claims pending against our subsidiaries substantially all of which relate to our discontinued operations we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition while most of the asbestos claims against us are covered by liability insurance policies from many years ago not all claims are insured as our insurers resolve claims relating to past policy periods the aggregate coverage provided by those policies erodes if we exhaust our coverage under those policies we will be exposed to potential uninsured losses 

failure to comply with the broad range of standards laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may result in exposure to substantial disruptions costs and liabilities 

both our products and the operation of our manufacturing facilities are subject to certain statutory and regulatory requirements these laws and regulations impose on us increasingly complex stringent and costly compliance activities including but not limited to environmental health and safety protection standards and permitting labeling and other requirements regarding among other things product efficiency and performance material makeup air quality and emissions and wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials remediation of environmental contamination and working conditions for and compensation of our employees we may also be affected by future standards laws or regulations including those imposed in response to energy climate change product functionality geopolitical corporate social responsibility or similar concerns these standards laws or regulations may impact our costs of operation the sourcing of raw materials and the manufacture and distribution of our products and place restrictions and other requirements or impediments on the products and solutions we can sell in certain geographical locations or on the willingness of certain investors to own our shares 

we are exposed to certain regulatory financial and other risks related to climate change and other sustainability matters 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us environmental protection agency “epa” has published findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases “ghgs” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are according to the epa contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climate changes based on these findings the epa has implemented regulations that require reporting of ghg emissions or that limit emissions of ghgs from certain mobile or stationary sources in addition the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have considered other legislation and regulatory proposals to reduce emissions of ghgs and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the development of ghg inventories ghg permitting andor regional ghg capandtrade programs it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program or other state programs may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol and in february 2021 the us rejoined the paris accord and these and other existing or potential international initiatives and regulations could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly our energy and industrial customers are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services as customers become increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their purchases if we fail to keep up with changing regulations or innovate or operate in ways that minimize the energy use of our products or operations customers may choose more energy efficient or sustainable alternatives these actions could also increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation we may also be subject to consumer lawsuits or enforcement actions by governmental authorities if our esg claims relating to product marketing are inaccurate it is uncertain what laws will be enacted and therefore we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition as part of our strategy regarding environmental climate change and sustainability matters we have set and may set additional targets aimed at reducing our impact on the environment and climate change andor targets relating to other sustainability matters it is possible that we may not be able to achieve such targets or our desired impact which may cause us to suffer from reputational damage or our business or financial condition could be adversely affected it is also possible that actions we take to achieve our strategy or targets could result in increased costs to our operations in addition investors and stakeholders are increasingly focused on esg matters and as stakeholder esg expectations and standards are evolving our failure to sufficiently respond to these evolving standards and expectations may cause us to suffer from reputational damage and our business or financial condition could be adversely affected 

increased information technology security threats and computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services and we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties as our business increasingly interfaces with employees customers dealers and suppliers using information technology systems and networks we are subject to an increased risk to the secure operation of these systems and networks our evolution into smart products internet of things businesstoconsumer and ecommerce subjects us to increased cyber and technology risks the secure operation of our information technology systems and networks is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data are increasing in frequency and sophistication these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain establishing systems and processes to address these threats may increase our costs we have experienced cybersecurity incidents and although we have determined such cybersecurity incidents to be immaterial and such incidents have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows there can be no assurance of similar results in the future should future attacks succeed in the theft of assets exporting sensitive data or financial information or controlling sensitive systems or networks it could expose us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers to the theft of assets misuse of information or systems compromising of confidential information manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition such cybersecurity incidents could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

changes in data privacy laws and our ability to comply with them could have a material adverse effect on us 

we collect and store data that is sensitive to us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers a variety of state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal and other data many foreign data privacy regulations including the general data protection 

regulation the “gdpr” in the european union are more stringent than federal regulations in the united states within the united states many states are considering adopting or have already adopted privacy regulations including for example the california consumer privacy act the applicability of these laws to our business has increased due to our focus on expanding businesstoconsumer and ecommerce offerings these laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and changing and could have an adverse effect on our operations companies’ obligations and requirements under these laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty in how they may be interpreted by courts and governmental authorities the costs of compliance with and the other burdens imposed by these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs andor result in interruptions or delays in the availability of systems in the case of noncompliance with these laws including the gdpr regulators have the authority to levy significant fines in addition if there is a breach of privacy we may be required to make notifications under data privacy regulations the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and other claims 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to litigation and other claims these legal proceedings are typically claims that relate to our products or services or to the conduct of our business and include without limitation claims relating to commercial regulatory or contractual disputes with suppliers authorities customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property matters environmental asbestos safety and health matters product liability the use or installation of our products consumer protection matters and employment and labor matters the outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to us we also may not have insurance that covers such claims while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms and this insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims and must satisfy deductibles on other insured claims further some of our business involves the sale of our products to customers that are constructing large and complex systems facilities or other capital projects and while we generally try to limit our exposure to liquidated damages consequential damages and other potential damages in the contracts for these projects we could be exposed to significant monetary damages and other liabilities in connection with the sale of our products for these projects for a variety of reasons in addition some of our businesses customers and dealers are subject to various laws and regulations regarding consumer protection and advertising and sales practices and we have been named and may be named in the future as a defendant in litigation some of which are or may be class action complaints arising from alleged violation of these laws and regulations in addition our indemnification obligations relating to the purchase or sale of businesses could result in litigation or claims of unknown amounts successful claims or litigation against us for significant amounts could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in ireland and tax residency in the uk 

we are subject to changes in law and other factors that may not allow us to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry 

while we believe that we should be able to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate also the tax laws and treaties of the us the uk ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate in addition legislative action could be taken by the us the uk ireland or the european union that could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulations upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to maintain tax residency in the uk we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

a change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges 

under current irish legislation a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in ireland if it is incorporated in ireland under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the uk is regarded as resident in the uk for taxation purposes unless it is treated as resident in another jurisdiction pursuant to any appropriate double tax treaty with the uk other jurisdictions may also seek to assert taxing jurisdiction over us 

the organization for economic cooperation and development proposed a number of measures relating to the tax treatment of multinationals some of which are implemented by amending double tax treaties through the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting the “mli” the mli has now entered into force for a number of countries including ireland and the uk under the double tax convention between ireland and the 

uk as amended by the mli the residence tiebreaker provides that a company will remain dual resident unless there is a determination otherwise by the tax authorities of the two contracting states 

we have obtained a determination from the competent authorities of the irish revenue commissioners and the uk hm revenue  customs which states that we are resident for tax purposes only in the uk 

it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of our affairs we could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the uk if we cease to be resident in the uk and become a resident in another jurisdiction we may be subject to uk exit charges and could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction including dividend withholding taxes or corporate income tax charges if we were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction we could be subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions if for example we were considered to be a tax resident of ireland we could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by us could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states which may negatively impact our ability to issue ordinary shares 

under irish law we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any ordinary shares including shares that are part of our authorized but unissued share capital in addition unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders when an irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a prorata basis if we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations our ability to issue ordinary shares under our equity compensation plans and if applicable to facilitate funding acquisitions or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected 

transfers of our ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company “dtc” will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold your ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases we may in our absolute discretion pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay any stamp duty our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii will have a lien against the shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in our shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us 

our ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax “cat” could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between 

spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €335000 per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents for periods on or after october 9 2019 

general risk factors

overview 

pentair plc and its consolidated subsidiaries “we” “us” “our” “pentair” or the “company” is a pure play water industrial manufacturing company comprised of two reporting segments consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies we classify our operations into business segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served for the year ended december 31 2021 the consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies segments represented approximately 62 and 38 of total revenues respectively 

although our jurisdiction of organization is ireland we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom the “uk” and therefore have our tax residency in the uk 

on october 18 2021 as part of both of our consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies reporting segments we completed the acquisition of pleatco holdings llc and related entities “pleatco” for 2546 million in cash net of cash acquired pleatco manufactures water filtration and clean air technologies for pool spa and industrial air customers 

on may 19 2021 as part of our consumer solutions reporting segment we completed the acquisition of ken’s beverage inc “kbi” for 831 million in cash net of cash acquired kbi provides beverage equipment and services to commercial customers 

covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak a pandemic the covid19 pandemic continues to persist throughout the us and the world with the continued potential for significant impact the covid19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelterinplace” and “stayathome” orders travel restrictions business curtailments limits on gatherings vaccine and mask requirements and other measures in addition governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

our businesses generally have been and continue to be considered essential under applicable governmentmandated orders which has allowed us substantially to maintain business continuity at substantially all of our manufacturing facilities throughout the covid19 pandemic while our facilities substantially remained operational during 2021 we continue to experience various degrees of manufacturing cost pressures and inefficiencies as a result of supply chain issues and in certain businesses increased demand although we regularly monitor the financial health and operations of companies in our supply chain and use 

alternative suppliers when necessary and available financial hardship or government restrictions on our suppliers or subsuppliers caused by the covid19 pandemic could cause a disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products and adversely affect our operations further as the covid19 pandemic conditions have improved and economic activity has increased we have experienced supply chain challenges including availability of materials increased lead times as well as inflation of raw materials logistics and labor costs due to availability constraints and high demand we expect the inflationary trends to continue in 2022 

in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic we maintain our commitment to protect the health and safety of our employees by continuing our enhanced safety protocols for those onsite at our manufacturing facilities for those who provide manufacturingsupport activities and for those working in office environments in addition we have maintained flexibility for employees who do not need to be physically present at our facilities and sites to perform their job responsibilities remotely and essential business travel has generally remained the main travel activity 

the extent of the covid19 pandemic’s effect on our operational and financial performance in the future will depend on future developments including the duration geographic location and intensity of the pandemic the impact of virus variants the effectiveness of vaccinations our continued ability to manufacture and distribute our products as well as any future actions that may be taken by governmental authorities or by us relating to the pandemic for more information regarding factors and events that may impact our business results of operations and financial condition as a result of the covid19 pandemic see part i—item 1a “risk factors” included herein 

transformation program 

during 2021 we launched and committed resources to a program designed to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion through transformation across our businesses to elevate our capabilities reduce complexity and streamline our processes the “transformation program” the transformation program is structured in multiple phases and is expected to empower us to work more efficiently and optimize our business to better serve our customers while meeting our financial objectives 

we are targeting at least 300 basis points of margin expansion by 2025 through 

• reducing business product and organizational complexity 

• elevating our proficiency in pricing sourcing and operations effectiveness 

• delivering decision making speed through organizational clarity and improved processes 

• developing a future state digital enterprise and 

• modernizing general and administrative capabilities 

during 2021 we incurred transformation costs that primarily represented professional services and project management related charges in 2022 we expect to continue to incur transformation costs that include professional services project management and related design and execution charges as well as costs related to both labor and nonlabor restructuring and it investments 

key trends and uncertainties regarding our existing business 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2021 and are reasonably likely to impact our results in the future 

• there are many uncertainties regarding the covid19 pandemic including the anticipated duration and severity of the pandemic the spread of increasing number of virus variants the extent of worldwide social political and economic disruption it may continue to cause and the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines to address the covid19 virus the broader implications of the covid19 pandemic that are reasonably likely to impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows cannot be determined at this time and ultimately will be affected by a number of evolving factors including the length of time that the pandemic continues and the impact of vaccines on it the impact of virus variants the effectiveness of vaccinations the pandemic’s effect on the demand for our products and services our supply chain and our manufacturing capacity as well as the impact of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic see further discussion above under “ covid19 pandemic” for key trends and uncertainties with regard to the covid19 pandemic 

• we executed certain business restructuring initiatives unrelated to the covid19 pandemic aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business we expect these actions to continue into 2022 and to drive margin growth 

• we created a transformation office and launched and committed resources to the transformation program designed to accelerate growth and drive margin expansion by driving operational excellence reducing complexity and streamlining our processes we expect to implement transformation program initiatives and incur transformation costs in 2022 and beyond 

• we experienced supply chain challenges including increased lead times for raw materials due to availability constraints and high demand while we have elevated our engagement with our suppliers and used secondary suppliers and new methods of procurement where available to mitigate the supply chain pressures we expect supply chain challenges to continue in 2022 and which may continue thereafter and could negatively impact our results of operations 

• we experienced inflationary increases of raw materials such as metals resins and electronics including drives and motors as well as increases in logistics and labor costs while we have taken pricing actions and we strive for productivity improvements that could help offset these inflationary cost increases we expect inflationary cost increases to continue in 2022 and which may continue thereafter and could negatively impact our results of operations 

• we have identified specific product and geographic market opportunities that we find attractive and continue to pursue both within and outside the us we are reinforcing that our businesses more effectively address these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources unless we successfully penetrate these markets our core sales growth will likely be limited or may decline 

in 2022 our operating objectives remain to focus on delivering our core while continuing to build out our future we expect to execute these objectives by 

• delivering revenue growth in our core businesses 

• delivering income and cash by managing pricecost inflation prioritization of growth investments and addressing the cost structures as necessary 

• continued focus on capital allocation through 

◦ commitment to maintain our investment grade rating 

◦ return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and 

◦ supplement our business with strategicallyaligned mergers and acquisitions 

• focused growth initiatives that accelerate our investments in digital technology and services expansion 

• implementation of transformation program initiatives that will drive operational excellence reduce complexity and improve our organizational structure and 

• building a high performance growth culture and delivering on our commitments while living our win right values 

consolidated results of operations 

the consolidated results of operations were as follows 



nm not meaningful 

net sales 

the components of the consolidated net sales change were as follows 



the 248 percent increase in consolidated net sales in 2021 from 2020 was primarily the result of 

• volume increase in our consumer solutions segment mainly driven by continued robust demand in our pool and water treatment businesses 

• volume increase in our industrial  flow technologies segment primarily driven by strong demand in the residential and irrigation flow businesses as well as increased demand and recovery in our food and beverage and commercial flow businesses 

• increases in selling prices to mitigate a rise in inflationary costs and 

• favorable foreign currency effects in 2021 compared to the prior year 

gross profit   

the gross profit as a percentage of net sales was unchanged when comparing 2021 and 2020 primarily as a result of 

• volume expansion in both our consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies segments 

• increases in selling prices to mitigate impacts of inflation 

• complexity reduction and exiting older less profitable product lines in our residential and commercial flow businesses in our industrial  flow technologies segment and 

• increased productivity in both the consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies segments 

this was offset by 

• inflationary cost increases due to tight supply of raw materials such as metals resins and electronics including drives and motors and 

• higher logistics and labor costs due to increased demand as well as factory labor wage increases 

selling general and administrative “sga”   

the 14 percentage point decrease in sga expense as a percentage of net sales in 2021 from 2020 was driven by 

• leverage on certain fixed costs due to the significant increase in sales year over year 

• legal settlements and accrual reductions of 76 million in 2021 

• restructuring and other costs of 74 million in 2021 compared to 141 million in 2020 and 

• lower amortization on definitelived intangible assets 

this decrease was partially offset by 

• higher employee incentive compensation due to increased sales and segment income in our consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies segments and 

• costs of 117 million related to the transformation program launched in 2021 

net interest expense 

the 477 percent decrease in net interest expense in 2021 from 2020 was the result of 

• strong cash flows in 2021 used to reduce overall debt levels during the year compared to 2020 and 

• lower interest rates on outstanding variable rate debt 

provision for income taxes 

the 61 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to 

• the unfavorable impact of discrete items including items related to the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act and items related to final regulations as part of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 that placed limitations on the deductibility of certain interest expense for us tax purposes that occurred during 2020 that did not occur in 2021 and 

• the favorable impact resulting from changes in unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken in prior periods 

this decrease was partially offset by 

• the unfavorable mix of global earnings 

2020 comparison with 2019 

a discussion of changes in our consolidated results of operations segment results of operations and liquidity and capital resources from the year ended december 31 2020 to december 31 2019 can be found in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the year 

ended december 31 2020 which was filed with the sec on february 16 2021 however such discussion is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this annual report on form 10k 

segment results of operations 

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies each of these segments is comprised of various product offerings that serve multiple end users 

we evaluate performance based on net sales and segment income and use a variety of ratios to measure performance of our reporting segments segment income represents equity income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and operating income exclusive of intangible amortization certain acquisition related expenses costs of restructuring and transformation activities impairments and other unusual nonoperating items 

consumer solutions 

the net sales and segment income for consumer solutions were as follows 



net sales 

the components of the change in consumer solutions net sales were as follows 



the 344 percent increase in net sales for consumer solutions in 2021 from 2020 was primarily the result of 

• increased sales volume in our pool business due to consumers increasing their pool use while continuing to invest in their homes and backyards 

• increased sales volume in our water treatment business as residential demand remained strong and commercial demand improved due to recovery in the restaurant and hospitality industries in 2021 

• increases in selling prices to mitigate impacts of inflation 

• increased sales due to the pleatco and kbi acquisitions that occurred in 2021 and 

• favorable foreign currency effects in 2021 compared to the prior year 

 

segment income 

the components of the change in consumer solutions segment income from the prior period were as follows 



the 03 percentage point decrease in segment income for consumer solutions as a percentage of net sales in 2021 from 2020 was primarily the result of 

• inflationary cost increases due to high demand and tight supply of raw materials such as metals resins and electronics including drives and motors along with increased logistics and labor costs 

• delayed realization of full amount of announced price increases due to order backlogs and 

• higher sales rebates and employee incentive compensation expense in line with increased sales in our pool and water treatment businesses 

this decrease was partially offset by 

• increased sales volume in all of our businesses resulting in cost leverage and higher productivity and 

• increases in selling prices to mitigate the impacts of inflation 

industrial  flow technologies 

the net sales and segment income for industrial  flow technologies were as follows 



net sales 

the components of the change in industrial  flow technologies net sales were as follows 

  

the 116 percent increase in net sales for industrial  flow technologies in 2021 from 2020 was primarily the result of 

• increased sales volume in our residential and irrigation flow businesses in 2021 due to strong demand across all product lines in these businesses 

• increased sales volume in our food and beverage business in 2021 due to demand in sustainable gas solutions and beer membrane filtration systems along with recovery in short cycle orders 

• increased sales volume in our commercial flow business due to demand in our water supply and water disposal product lines 

• increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases and 

• favorable foreign currency effects compared to the prior year 

segment income 

the components of the change in industrial  flow technologies segment income from the prior period were as follows 



the 21 percentage point increase in segment income for industrial  flow technologies as a percentage of net sales in 2021 from 2020 was primarily the result of 

• increased sales volumes in our residential and irrigation flow and food and beverage businesses which resulted in increased leverage on fixed operating expenses and improved income dropthrough 

• increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases 

• complexity reduction and exiting older less profitable product lines in our residential and commercial flow businesses and 

• increased productivity due to cost actions driving manufacturing efficiencies 

this increase was partially offset by 

• inflationary cost increases due to high demand and tight supply of metals resins and electronics along with increased logistics due to supply chain constraints and labor costs due to workforce shortages 

backlog of orders by segment 



the majority of our backlog is short cycle in nature with shipments within one year from when a customer places an order and a substantial portion of our revenues has historically resulted from orders received and products delivered in the same month a portion of our backlog particularly from orders for major capital projects can take more than one year from order to delivery depending on the size and type of order we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract our backlog of orders is dependent upon when customers place orders and is not necessarily an indicator of our expected results for our 2022 net sales 

the increase in our backlog from the prior year was driven by a significant increase in orders due to higher than anticipated demand in our pool business and certain of our residential and commercial businesses coupled with continuing supply chain disruptions and labor availability challenges 

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings our primary revolving credit facility has generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities or completed debt and equity offerings as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets consistent with historical trends we experienced seasonal cash usage in the first quarter of 2021 and drew on our revolving credit facility to fund our operations this cash usage reversed in the second quarter of 2021 as the seasonality of our businesses peaked and generated significant 

cash to fund our operations in the second half of 2021 we funded our operations using our continued strong cash flow and our revolving credit facility 

enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and historically has been at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike has historically been partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperature heavy flooding and droughts 

in 2021 we completed the acquisitions of kbi and pleatco for total consideration of approximately 831 million and 2546 million respectively in cash net of cash acquired we funded the purchase price for these acquisitions with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

summary of cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations were as follows 



operating activities 

in 2021 net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations primarily reflects net income from continuing operations of 6335 million net of noncash depreciation and amortization additionally we had a cash outflow of 208 million as a result of changes in net working capital primarily due to increased sales demand and inflationary impacts leading to higher accounts receivable inventory accounts payable and other current liabilities balances 

in 2020 net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations primarily reflects net income from continuing operations of 4322 million net of noncash depreciation and amortization additionally we had a cash inflow of 1095 million as a result of changes in net working capital primarily the result of accounts receivables collections and reduced accounts receivables due to the pool business early buy program shipments with extended payment terms moving from the fourth quarter of 2020 into 2021 due to continued strong demand 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities of continuing operations in 2021 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 602 million and cash paid for acquisitions of 3385 million in our consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies reporting segments net of cash acquired 

net cash used for investing activities of continuing operations in 2020 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 622 million and cash paid for acquisitions of 580 million in our consumer solutions reporting segment net of cash acquired 

financing activities 

in 2021 net cash used for financing activities primarily relates to repayment of 1038 million of senior notes 1500 million of share repurchases dividend payments of 1330 million and payments upon maturity of cross currency swaps of 147 million partially offset by net borrowings of revolving longterm debt of 1589 million 

in 2020 net cash used for financing activities primarily relates to repayment of commercial paper and revolving longterm debt of 1175 million repayment of 740 million of senior notes 1502 million of share repurchases and dividend payments of 1271 million 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends repurchase shares and repay debt in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow

the parent company guarantor and subsidiary issuer do not have material results of operations on a combined basis 

material cash requirements from contractual obligations and commitments 

we expect to continue to have sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe we have the ability to meet our shortterm and longterm cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities the following summarizes our material cash requirements from significant contractual obligations and purchase commitments that impact our liquidity as of december 31 2021 



the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business for purposes of the above table arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 

in addition to the significant contractual obligations described above we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2021 variable interest rate debt was 3950 million at a weighted average interest rate of 107 

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2021 was estimated to be 373 million we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes and net interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2021 we had recorded 02 million for the possible payment of penalties and 39 million related to the possible payment of interest 

commitments and contingencies

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation and applicable accounting rules as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

• it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate and 

• changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we perform our annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the relevant reporting unit with its carrying amount we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test however we may elect to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist 

during 2021 a qualitative assessment was performed as a result it was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values factors considered in the analysis included the 2020 discounted cash flow fair value assessment of the reporting units and the calculated excess fair value over carrying amount financial performance forecasts and trends market capitalization regulatory and environmental issues macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations raw material costs and management stability we also consider the extent to which each of the adverse events and circumstances identified affect the comparison of the respective reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying amount we place more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect the respective reporting unit’s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets we consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that may affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names proprietary technology and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test the first day of the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization 

the impairment test for trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the nonrecurring fair value measurement is a “level 3” measurement under the fair value hierarchy no impairment charge was recorded during 2021 for identifiable intangible assets 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor us and nonus definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other postretirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year “marktomarket adjustment” and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other postretirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments marktomarket adjustments resulted in a pretax gain of 24 million in 2021 a pretax loss of 67 million in 2020 and a pretax gain of 34 million in 2019 the remaining components of pension expense including service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense 

discount rates 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds rated aa or higher available in the marketplace there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumptions that will impact our pension expense in 2022 

expected rate of return 

the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longterm market indices 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarial estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2021 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 56 fixedrate debt and 44 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2021 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 312 million decrease or 337 million increase in fair value respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2021 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 40 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are generally the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk at december 31 2021 we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with gross notional us dollar equivalent amounts of 147 million changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income when the hedged item affects earnings 

at december 31 2021 we had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a combined notional amount of 7944 million the cross currency swap agreements are accounted for as either cash flow hedges to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt or as net investment hedges to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange rate the currency risk related to the cross currency swap agreements is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 646 million net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in an 647 million net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income however these increases and decreases in other comprehensive income would be offset by decreases or increases in the hedged items on our balance sheet

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document 

risks relating to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic is expected to have a material negative impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business and financial results have been and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic the severity magnitude and duration of the current covid19 pandemic is uncertain rapidly changing and hard to predict in 2020 the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and our business and it is expected to negatively impact our business in numerous ways including but not limited to those outlined below 

• the covid19 pandemic has caused a global economic slowdown that may last for a potentially extended duration and it is possible that it could cause a global recession deteriorating economic and political conditions caused by the covid19 pandemic such as increased unemployment decreases in capital spending declines in consumer confidence or economic slowdowns or recessions could cause a decrease in demand for our products 

• due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced and expect to continue to experience reductions in customer demand for certain of our products and in several of our endmarkets including commercial filtration commercial flow industrial filtration and food and beverage 

• the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting and is expected to continue to adversely affect certain elements of our business including certain elements of our operations supply chains and distribution systems including as a result of impacts associated with required preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses our communities and governments are taking these impacts include requiring employees to work from home or not go into their offices or facilities limiting the number of employees attending meetings reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time reducing employee travel and adopting other employee safety measures these measures also may impact our ability to meet production demands or requests and may delay our new product introductions depending on employee attendance or ability to continue to work in addition we have experienced disruptions at some of our facilities with higher absenteeism due to the covid19 pandemic 

• if the covid19 pandemic continues and economic conditions worsen we expect to experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities customer orders and our collections of accounts receivable which may be material and it remains uncertain the impact on future operational and commercial activities customer orders and collections even if economic conditions begin to improve 

• government or regulatory responses to the covid19 pandemic have and are likely to continue to negatively impact our business during the first and second quarters of 2020 mandatory lockdowns or other restrictions on operations in 

some countries temporarily disrupted our ability to manufacture or distribute our products in some of these markets a reoccurrence of these disruptions could materially adversely impact our operations and results in addition the current resurgence of the covid19 pandemic and government restrictions related thereto in the fourth quarter of 2020 and first quarter of 2021 may negatively impact demand in certain of our commercial and industrial businesses in addition to existing travel restrictions jurisdictions may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity and other related supply chain delays may develop which could significantly impact our ability to support our operations and customers meet demand develop new products ship our backlog and also impact the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to produce products and services or significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain 

• the impacts of the covid19 pandemic may limit our ability to reduce our overall operating costs we have experienced increased costs relating to our efforts to mitigate the impact of the covid19 pandemic through among other things enhanced sanitization procedures and socialdistancing measures we have enacted and will likely continue to enact at our locations around the world in an effort to protect our employees’ health and wellbeing 

• the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our operations global supply chain and routes to market or those of our suppliers or their suppliers these disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them have increased and may continue to increase product distribution or labor costs or cause delays in delivering our backlog or may cause an inability to deliver products to our customers or meet customer demand 

• while we have experienced high demand in our pool business as consumers shelteredinplace and have spent more time at home as a result of the covid19 pandemic that contributed to growth in our sales during 2020 such growth may not be sustainable and may not be repeated in future periods furthermore even if growth in demand continues we may not be able to meet that demand due to production and capacity challenges 

• disruptions or uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in delays or modifications to some of our strategic plans and initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve our growth targets 

• the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in and disrupted the capital markets and commercial paper markets and volatility is likely to continue we might not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like and our borrowing costs could increase 

• actions we have taken or may take or decisions we have made or may make as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic may result in legal investigations or claims regulatory actions or litigation against us 

we might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts of the covid19 pandemic on a timely basis to prevent near or longterm adverse impacts to our results due to the speed with which the covid19 situation continues to develop the global breadth of its spread and the range of governmental and community reactions thereto there is uncertainty around its duration and ultimate impact and uncertainty regarding the availability and distribution of vaccines to address the covid19 virus therefore any negative impact on our business financial condition including without limitation our liquidity results of operations and cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but the covid19 pandemic could lead to extended disruption of economic activity and the impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be material the ultimate impact of these disruptions also depends on events beyond our knowledge or control including the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic and actions taken by parties other than us to respond to them the foregoing and other impacts of the covid19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below and any of these impacts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our business 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial commercial and residential markets we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and results of operations due to economic and business cycles important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the global economy and various regional economies and our customers’ confidence in these economies industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of residential and commercial real estate markets residential housing markets the commercial business climate unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates and energy and commodity prices the businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of the above factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could reduce demand 

for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us we compete based on technical expertise intellectual property reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms service offerings customer experience and service and price competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with ours some of our competitors attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price moreover demand for our products which impacts profit margins is affected by changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases adoption of new technology and connected products and changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors customer purchasing behavior may also shift by product mix in the market or result in a shift to new distribution channels including ecommerce which is a rapidly developing area if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and solutions or adapt to changes in customer purchasing behavior or shifts in distribution channels or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2020 accounted for 33 of our net sales our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principal nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenue in future periods in addition currency variations could have a material adverse effect on margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the us and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the us 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to transform and adapt our products services solutions and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses in addition we need to be flexible to adapt our products to ever changing customer preferences including those relating to regulatory climate change and social responsibility matters accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to transform and adapt our products services solutions organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target end markets and develop or acquire competitive technologies products services and solutions and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively the failure to effectively adapt our products services or solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to identify finance and complete suitable acquisitions and investments and any completed acquisitions and investments may be unsuccessful or consume significant resources 

our business strategy includes acquiring businesses and making investments that complement our existing businesses we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product service and solution offerings we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain financing or have sufficient cash necessary for acquisitions or successfully complete acquisitions in the future acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

• diversion of management time and attention from daily operations 

• difficulties integrating acquired businesses technologies and personnel into our business 

• difficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business information of acquired businesses 

• inability to obtain required regulatory approvals 

• potential loss of key employees key contractual relationships or key customers of acquired companies or of ours 

• assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies and 

• dilution of interests of holders of our shares through the issuance of equity securities or equitylinked securities 

any acquisitions or investments may not be successful or realize the intended benefits and may ultimately result in impairment charges or have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our business initiatives 

during 2020 2019 and 2018 we initiated and continued execution of certain business initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business as a result we have incurred substantial expense including restructuring charges we may not be able to achieve the operating efficiencies to reduce costs or realize benefits that were anticipated in connection with these initiatives if we are unable to execute these initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  

we are exposed to political regulatory economic trade and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2020 accounted for 33 of our net sales further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from nonus suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic trade and other risks that are inherent in operating in and purchasing from numerous countries these risks include 

• changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets 

• relatively more severe economic conditions in some international markets than in the us 

• the imposition of tariffs duties exchange controls or other trade restrictions 

• changes in tax treaties laws or rulings that could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through nonus legal systems 

• the difficulty of communicating and monitoring evolving standards and directives across our product lines services and global facilities 

• the difficulty of ensuring that products and services meet everchanging regional regulations and requirements 

• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions 

• the possibility of terrorist action affecting us or our operations 

• the threat of nationalization and expropriation 

• the difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in nonus labor markets 

• limitations on repatriation of earnings or other regionallyimposed capital requirements 

• the difficulty of protecting intellectual property in nonus countries and 

• changes in and required compliance with a variety of nonus laws and regulations 

in 2016 the united kingdom held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the european union “brexit” the united kingdom subsequently withdrew from the european union effective on january 31 2020 subject to a transition period that ended on december 31 2020 since january 1 2021 the european union  united kingdom trade and cooperative agreement has provisionally been in effect given the lack of comparable precedent the implications of brexit or how such implications might affect our company continue to remain unclear at this time brexit could among other impacts disrupt trade and the movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

changes in us or foreign government administrative policy including changes to existing trade agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 

as a result of changes to us or foreign government administrative policy there may be changes to existing trade agreements like the usmexicocanada agreement “usmca” greater restrictions on free trade generally significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the us particularly tariffs on products manufactured in mexico china or other countries where we purchase from have operations or manufacture or sell products prohibitions or restrictions on doing business with certain companies including those with certain relationships with china and adverse responses by foreign governments to us trade policy among other possible changes it remains unclear what the us administration or foreign governments including china will or will not do with respect to tariffs usmca or other international trade agreements and policies a trade war other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements including usmca changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently purchase manufacture and sell products and any resulting negative sentiments towards the us as a result of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience cost and other inflation 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs including wages pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs however these actions may not be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity and we anticipate inflation to continue with respect to materials especially resins copper steel and stainless steel as well as labor continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage furthermore our business strategy also includes expanding our smart products and internet of things offerings and there are many other companies that hold patents in this space over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant as of december 31 2020 our goodwill and intangible assets were 2718 million and represented 65 of our total assets declines in fair market value could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 

a loss of or material cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by one or more of our largest customers could harm our business 

our net sales to our largest customer represented approximately 15 of our consolidated net sales in 2020 while we do not have any other customers that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales in 2020 we have other customers that are key to the success of our business our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of larger customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business our success is dependent on retaining these customers which requires us to successfully manage relationships and anticipate the needs of our customers in the channels in which we sell our products our customers also may be impacted by economic conditions in the industries of those customers which could result in reduced demand for our products we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain our largest customers in addition some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by these customers or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

catastrophic and other events beyond our control may disrupt operations at our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers which could cause us to be unable to meet customer demands or increase our costs or reduce customer spending 

if operations at any of our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters earthquakes power outages fires explosions terrorism adverse weather conditions labor disputes public health epidemics including the covid19 pandemic or other catastrophic events or disruptions outside of our control we may be unable to fill customer orders and otherwise meet customer demand for our products in particular our pool business operations in north carolina and california are in areas that are more susceptible to natural disasters such as hurricanes wildfires and earthquakes in addition these types of events may negatively impact residential commercial and industrial spending in impacted regions or depending on the severity globally as a result any of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we maintain property insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment and to cover business interruption losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand with endcustomers and endusers within each of our business segments demand for pool equipment in the pool business water treatment solutions in our water treatment and industrial filtration businesses and residential water supply infrastructure and agricultural products in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august while we attempt to mitigate the magnitude of the sales spike in the pool business and in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts we cannot provide any assurance that such programs will be successful in addition seasonal effects in the pool business and in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment may vary from year to year and be impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperature heavy flooding and droughts moreover adverse weather conditions such as cold or wet weather may negatively impact demand for and sales of pool equipment in the pool business and residential water supply commercial infrastructure and agricultural products in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment 

our focus on consumer solutions for residential and commercial water treatment as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

as we introduce residential and commercial water treatment solutions we may have limited experience in markets we choose to enter and our customers may not like our value propositions new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results designing marketing and executing these solutions is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises which may be higher than the related revenue 

• the requirement to recruit train and retain qualified personnel 

• increased risk of errors or omissions in the sales or fulfillment of solutions or services 

• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses 

• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes which may increase our scope of liability 

• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to our consumer products services and solutions and related business model 

• the engagement of third parties to assist with sales installation or servicing of our products and solutions and the potential responsibility for the actions they take and 

• increased risk of noncompliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these solutions 

these expanded risks increase the complexity of our business and place significant responsibility on our management employees operations systems technical expertise financial resources and internal controls and compliance functions 

interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability 

any material interruption in our supply chain such as material interruption of the supply of raw materials and components due to the casualty loss of any of our manufacturing plants interruptions in service by our thirdparty logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels unexpected delays in shipping or processing through customs of goods trade restrictions such as increased tariffs or quotas embargoes or customs restrictions or other unexpected or uncontrollable events that cause a material interruption in our supply chain such as pandemics social or labor unrest natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability additionally our raw materials and components are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners we rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner may be a challenge especially with respect to raw materials and components sourced from outside the us and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest for certain products we may rely on one or very few suppliers a suppliers failure to meet our standards provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control these issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our debt and financial markets 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants including those that limit the amount of our debt which may restrict the operations of our business and our ability to incur additional debt to finance acquisitions our ability to meet the financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital our credit ratings may be downgraded in the future or our interest rates may increase each of which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2020 we had 8396 million of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate if our cash requirements are more than we expect or if we intend to finance acquisitions we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected 

unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets may become restricted additionally our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded in addition borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans bear interest at a rate equal to an adjusted base rate or the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus in each case an applicable margin the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced it intends to phase out 

libor by the end of 2021 the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loans provides procedures for determining a replacement or alternative base rate in the event that libor is discontinued however any calculation of interest based upon such replacement or alternative base rate may result in higher interest rates to the extent that our interest rates increase our interest expense will increase which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable for example during 2020 the commercial paper market began to experience high levels of volatility due to uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic that impacted both market access to and pricing of commercial paper and we withdrew our credit ratings to access the commercial paper market these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for products or for customers to purchase products or commence new projects as suppliers and customers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws outside the us could have a material adverse effect on us 

the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased regulations and scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from negligent reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees customers or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may require selfdisclosure to government agencies and result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations and changes in us government sanctions could have a material adverse effect on us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we sell are “dual use” products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to sanctioned entities or to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

we are exposed to environmental laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to us federal state local and nonus laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits many of which are subject to renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that may be required compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as a defendant target or a potentially responsible party “prp” in a number of environmental matters relating to our current or former businesses we have disposed of a number of businesses and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers of businesses from us we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring individual or classaction claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by the operations of divested or acquired businesses or other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of remediation and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities could exceed the amount of our current reserves 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials substantially all of which relate to our discontinued operations these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names a large number of product manufacturers service providers and premises owners historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and settling claims before trial only where appropriate as of december 31 2020 there were approximately 630 claims pending against our subsidiaries substantially all of which relate to our discontinued operations we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition most of the asbestos claims against us are covered by liability insurance policies from many years ago as our insurers resolve claims relating to past policy periods the aggregate coverage provided by those policies erodes if we exhaust our coverage under those policies we will be exposed to potential uninsured losses 

failure to comply with the broad range of standards laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may result in exposure to substantial disruptions costs and liabilities 

both our products and the operation of our manufacturing facilities are subject to certain statutory and regulatory requirements these laws and regulations impose on us increasingly complex stringent and costly compliance activities including but not limited to environmental health and safety protection standards and permitting labeling and other requirements regarding among other things pump efficiency air quality and emissions and wastewater discharges the use handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials remediation of environmental contamination and working conditions for and compensation of our employees we may also be affected by future standards laws or regulations including those imposed in response to energy climate change product functionality geopolitical corporate social responsibility or similar concerns these standards laws or regulations may impact our costs of operation the sourcing of raw materials and the manufacture and distribution of our products and place restrictions and other requirements or impediments on the products and solutions we can sell in certain geographical locations or on the willingness of certain investors to own our shares 

we are exposed to certain regulatory financial and other risks related to climate change and other sustainability matters 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us environmental protection agency “epa” has published findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases “ghgs” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are according to the epa contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climate changes based on these findings the epa has implemented regulations that require reporting of ghg emissions or that limit emissions of ghgs from certain mobile or stationary sources in addition the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have considered other legislation and regulatory proposals to reduce emissions of ghgs and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the development of ghg inventories ghg permitting andor regional ghg capandtrade programs it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program or other state programs may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol andor the paris accord and these and other existing international initiatives and regulations or those under consideration could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly our energy and industrial customers are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services as customers become increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their purchases if we fail to keep up with changing regulations or innovate or operate in ways that minimize the energy use of our products or operations customers may choose more energy efficient or sustainable alternatives these actions could also increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation it is uncertain what laws will be enacted and therefore we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition as part of our strategy regarding environmental climate change and sustainability matters we may set targets aimed at reducing our impact on the environment and climate change or targets relating to other sustainability matters it is possible that we may not be able to achieve such targets or our desired impact which may cause us to suffer from reputational damage or our business or financial condition could be adversely affected it is also possible that failure to achieve such targets or actions we take to achieve our strategy or targets would result in increased costs to our operations in addition investors and stakeholders are increasingly focused on esg matters and as stakeholder esg expectations and standards are evolving this may cause us to suffer from reputational damage and our business or financial condition could be adversely affected 

increased information technology security threats and computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services and we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties as our business increasingly interfaces with employees customers dealers and suppliers using information technology systems and networks we are subject to an increased risk to the secure operation of these systems and networks our evolution into smart products internet of things businesstoconsumer and ecommerce subjects us to increased cyber and technology risks the secure operation of our information technology systems and networks is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data are increasing in frequency and sophistication these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain establishing systems and processes to address these threats may increase our costs we have experienced data breaches and although we have determined such data breaches to be immaterial and such data breaches have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows there can be no assurance of similar results in the future should future attacks succeed in the theft of assets exporting sensitive data or financial information or controlling sensitive systems or networks it could expose us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers to the theft of assets misuse of information or systems compromising of confidential information manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

changes in data privacy laws and our ability to comply with them could have a material adverse effect on us 

we collect and store data that is sensitive to us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers a variety of state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal and other data many foreign data privacy regulations including the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” in the european union are more stringent than federal regulations in the united states within the united states many states are considering adopting or have already adopted privacy regulations including for example the california consumer privacy act the applicability of these laws to our business has increased due to our focus on expanding businesstoconsumer and ecommerce offerings these laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and changing and could have an adverse effect on our operations companies’ obligations and requirements under these laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty in how they may be interpreted by courts and governmental authorities the costs of compliance with and the other burdens imposed by these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs andor result in interruptions or delays in the availability of systems in the case of noncompliance with these laws including the gdpr regulators have the authority to levy significant fines in addition if there is a breach of privacy we may be required to make notifications under data privacy regulations the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and other claims 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to litigation and other claims these legal proceedings are typically claims that relate to our products or services or to the conduct of our business and include without limitation claims relating to commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property matters environmental safety and health matters product liability the use or installation of our products consumer protection matters and employment and labor matters the outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to us we also may not have insurance that covers such claims while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms and this insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims and must satisfy deductibles on other insured claims further some of our business involves the sale of our products to customers that are constructing large and complex systems facilities or other capital projects and while we generally try to limit our exposure to liquidated damages consequential damages and other potential damages in the contracts for these projects we could be exposed to significant monetary damages and other liabilities in connection with the sale of our products for these projects for a variety of reasons in addition some of our businesses customers and dealers are subject to various laws and regulations regarding consumer protection and advertising and sales practices and we have been named and may be named in the future as a defendant in litigation some of which are or may be class action complaints arising from alleged violation of these laws and regulations successful claims or litigation against us for significant amounts could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in ireland and tax residency in the uk 

we are subject to changes in law and other factors that may not allow us to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry 

while we believe that we should be able to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate also the tax laws and treaties of the us the uk ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate in addition legislative action could be taken by the us the uk ireland or the european union that could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulations upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to maintain tax residency in the uk we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

a change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges 

under current irish legislation a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in ireland if it is incorporated in ireland under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the uk is regarded as resident in the uk for taxation purposes unless it is treated as resident in another jurisdiction pursuant to any appropriate double tax treaty with the uk other jurisdictions may also seek to assert taxing jurisdiction over us 

the organization for economic cooperation and development proposed a number of measures relating to the tax treatment of multinationals some of which are implemented by amending double tax treaties through the multilateral convention to implement tax treaty related measures to prevent base erosion and profit shifting the “mli” the mli has now entered into force for a number of countries including ireland and the uk under the double tax convention between ireland and the uk as amended by the mli the residence tiebreaker provides that a company will remain dual resident unless there is a determination otherwise by the tax authorities of the two contracting states 

we have obtained a determination from the competent authorities of the irish revenue commissioners and the uk hm revenue  customs which states that we are resident for tax purposes only in the uk 

it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of our affairs we could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the uk if we cease to be resident in the uk and become a resident in another jurisdiction we may be subject to uk exit charges and could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction including dividend withholding taxes or corporate income tax charges if we were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction we could be subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions if for example we were considered to be a tax resident of ireland we could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by us could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of our ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company “dtc” will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold your ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 percent of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases we may in our absolute discretion pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay any stamp duty our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii will have a lien against the shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in our shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us 

our ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax “cat” could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €335000 per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents for periods on or after october 9 2019 

general risk factors 

our share price may fluctuate significantly

overview 

pentair plc and its consolidated subsidiaries “we” “us” “our” “pentair” or the “company” is a pure play water industrial manufacturing company comprised of two reporting segments consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies we classify our operations into business segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served for the year ended december 31 2020 the consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies segments represented approximately 58 and 42 of total revenues respectively 

although our jurisdiction of organization is ireland we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom the “uk” and therefore have our tax residency in the uk 

on april 30 2018 we completed the separation of our electrical business from the rest of pentair the “separation” by means of a dividend in specie of the electrical business which was effected by the transfer of the electrical business from pentair to nvent and the issuance by nvent of nvent ordinary shares directly to pentair shareholders the “distribution” we did not retain an equity interest in nvent the results of the electrical business have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented the electrical business was previously disclosed as a standalone reporting segment 

in february 2019 as part of consumer solutions we completed the acquisitions of aquion inc “aquion” and pelican water systems “pelican” for 1634 million and 1211 million respectively in cash net of cash acquired and final working capital trueups aquion offers a diverse line of water conditioners water filters drinkingwater purifiers ozone and ultraviolet disinfection systems reverse osmosis systems and acid neutralizers for the residential and commercial water treatment industry pelican provides residential whole home water treatment systems 

covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the covid19 outbreak a pandemic the covid19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the united states “us” and the world with the continued potential for significant impact the covid19 pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing increasingly stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus including quarantines “shelterinplace” and “stayathome” orders travel restrictions business curtailments limits on gatherings and other measures in addition governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic the effects of the covid19 pandemic have had and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on certain parts of our business 

health and safety 

from the earliest signs of the outbreak we have taken proactive action to protect the health and safety of our employees customers and suppliers we have enacted rigorous safety measures in our sites including implementing social distancing protocols implementing working from home arrangements for those employees who do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor and do not provide manufacturingsupport activities suspending travel extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces conducting temperature monitoring at our facilities and providing or accommodating the wearing of facial coverings to those employees who must be physically present in their workplace and where facial coverings are required by local government orders we expect to continue to implement these measures until we determine that the covid19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees customers and suppliers for the year ended december 31 2020 we incurred 104 million of costs related to providing for the health and safety of our employees specific to the covid19 pandemic 

operations 

we have important manufacturing operations in the us and around the world that have been affected by the covid19 pandemic and we have taken certain actions to help curb its spread governmentmandated measures providing for business curtailments or shutdowns generally exclude certain essential businesses and services including businesses that manufacture and sell products that are considered essential to daily lives or otherwise operate in essential or critical sectors while substantially all of our manufacturing facilities are considered essential and have remained operational we have experienced intermittent partial or full factory closures at certain facilities as a result of these measures or the need to sanitize the facilities and address employee wellbeing we also experienced brief interruptions in operations due to governmentmandated shutdowns at our sites in india italy and new zealand during the year ended december 31 2020 while sanitationrelated closures or governmental shutdowns may occur again in the future all of our manufacturing facilities currently remain operational in addition we have experienced disruptions at some of our facilities with higher absenteeism due to the covid19 pandemic 

supply 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted our factory productivity and supply chain certain of our suppliers particularly in our pool and flow businesses faced difficulties maintaining operations in light of manufacturing shutdowns and interruptions due to the covid19 pandemic which negatively impacted our production and contributed to an increase in backlog during the third quarter of 2020 we identified second source suppliers and increased supply for key items in our pool business to reduce the production and capacity challenges we encountered in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of supply chain issues and increased demand these supply chain and capacity challenges have led to higher transportation and labor costs in order to timely deliver finished goods to our customers restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures have in certain cases resulted and may continue to result in higher costs and delays both for obtaining raw materials and components and shipping finished goods to customers which could harm our profitability make our products less competitive or cause our customers to seek alternative suppliers although we regularly monitor the financial health and operations of companies in our supply chain and use alternative suppliers when necessary and available financial hardship or government restrictions on our suppliers or subsuppliers caused by the covid19 pandemic could cause a disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products and adversely affect our operations 

demand 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty we have experienced and expect to continue to experience reductions in customer demand in several of our endmarkets 

within our consumer solutions segment the covid19 pandemic has impacted demand in each of our businesses our pool business has experienced high demand as consumers shelteredinplace and have spent more time at home while shelterinplace orders impacted our ability to reach our customers in our r esidential water treatment business at the beginning of the second quarter of 2020 we started to see stabilization in demand in this business towards the end of the second quarter and then saw demand rebound in the second half of 2020 as consumers became more comfortable allowing dealers back into their homes to test their water and install new systems our commercial filtration business was negatively impacted by restaurant and hospitality industry closures or operations at limited capacity across north america and europe in the second quarter and to a lesser extent in the second half of 2020 new or extended governmentmandated shutdowns could impact demand for our consumer solutions products in the future 

within our industrial  flow technologies segment demand for our residential flow products was initially negatively impacted due to store closures as a result of statewide orders in the us however sell through improved throughout the year driven by pent up demand from the earlier closures demand continued to remain soft in our commercial and infrastructure flow businesses but stabilized in the third quarter of 2020 in our industrial filtration business demand is mostly driven by customer capital spending which was reduced andor delayed beginning in the second quarter of 2020 across most industries served in addition lower asset utilization drove down demand in industrial filtration aftermarket sales furthermore many of our commercial customers have been negatively impacted due to worldwide lockdowns as a result of the covid19 pandemic while we are preparing for this business to remain under pressure in the near term we expect longterm demand drivers for this business not to be significantly changed 

the current covid19 pandemic or continued spread of covid19 has caused a global economic slowdown and a possibility of a global recession in the event of a recession demand for our products would decline and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 

cost mitigation actions 

with the continuing uncertainty in light of the covid19 pandemic we have taken steps across our organization to align costs with lower sales volumes these steps include renegotiation with suppliers to reduce input costs driving manufacturing direct labor reductions in line with volume drop delaying reducing or eliminating purchased services and travel and where appropriate temporary furloughs and hiring freezes additionally we are proactively managing our working capital and reviewing our capital spending plan but have not deferred strategic ongoing initiatives we also continue to monitor government economic stabilization efforts and have participated in certain legislative provisions such as deferring estimated tax payments and may apply for job retention credits 

we continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation including the development of vaccines and their distribution to address the covid19 virus and guidance from international and domestic authorities including federal state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their requirements and recommendations in these circumstances there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan as such given the dynamic nature of this situation we cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows in the future in addition see part i —i tem 1a “risk factors” included herein for our risk factors regarding risks associated with the covid19 pandemic 

key trends and uncertainties regarding our existing business 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2020 and will likely impact our results in the future 

• there are many uncertainties regarding the covid19 pandemic including the anticipated duration and severity of the pandemic the extent of worldwide social political and economic disruption it may continue to cause and the development and distribution of vaccines to address the covid19 virus the broader implications of the covid19 pandemic on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows cannot be determined at this time and ultimately will be affected by a number of evolving factors including the length of time that the pandemic continues and the impact of vaccines on it its effect on the demand for our products and services our supply chain and our manufacturing capacity as well as the impact of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic see further discussion above under “ covid19 pandemic” for key trends and uncertainties with regard to the covid19 pandemic 

• during 2020 we executed certain business restructuring initiatives unrelated to the covid19 pandemic aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business we expect these actions to continue into 2021 and to drive margin growth 

• we have identified specific product and geographic market opportunities that we find attractive and continue to pursue both within and outside the us we are reinforcing that our businesses more effectively address these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources unless we successfully penetrate these markets our core sales growth will likely be limited or may decline 

• we have experienced material and other cost inflation we strive for productivity improvements and we implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate this inflation we expect the current economic environment will result in continuing price volatility for many of our raw materials and we are uncertain as to the timing and impact of these market changes 

in 2021 our operating objectives remain to focus on delivering our core while continuing to build out our future we expect to execute these objectives by 

• delivering revenue growth in our core businesses 

• delivering income and cash by managing pricecost inflation prioritization of growth investments and addressing the cost structures as necessary 

• continued focus on capital allocation through 

◦ commitment to maintain our investment grade rating 

◦ return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks and 

◦ supplement our business with strategicallyaligned mergers and acquisitions 

• focused growth initiatives that accelerate our investments in digital technology and services expansion and 

• building a high performance growth culture and delivering on our commitments while living our win right values 

consolidated results of operations 

the consolidated results of operations were as follows 



nm not meaningful 

net sales 

the components of the consolidated net sales change were as follows 



the 20 percent increase in consolidated net sales in 2020 from 2019 was primarily the result of 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases 

• increased sales due to the aquion and pelican acquisitions in february 2019 and other small acquisitions in our consumer solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first half of 2020 

• volume increase in our consumer solutions segment mainly driven by our pool business 

• volume increase in our residential and irrigation flow businesses in our industrial  flow technologies segment and 

• favorable foreign currency effects in 2020 compared to the prior year 

this increase was partially offset by 

• sales volume declines in certain businesses within our industrial  flow technologies segment due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic 

gross profit   

the 06 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2020 from 2019 was primarily the result of 

• unfavorable mix within the pool and commercial and infrastructure flow businesses 

• lower volumes within our commercial water supply water disposal industrial filtration and food and beverage businesses 

• higher transportation and labor costs due to increased demand in our pool business 

• costs related to providing for the health and safety of our employees specific to the covid19 pandemic of 86 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and 

• inflationary increases related to certain raw materials 

this decrease was partially offset by 

• increased productivity due to higher volumes in our pool business 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate impacts of inflation and 

• increased productivity due to cost actions such as temporary furloughs and hiring freezes in response to the covid19 pandemic driving manufacturing efficiencies and lower operating expenses 

selling general and administrative “sga”   

the 11 percentage point decrease in sga expense as a percentage of net sales in 2020 from 2019 was driven by 

• asset impairment charges of 212 million in 2019 

• reduction in travel and entertainment trade show and advertising expenses due to the covid19 pandemic and 

• restructuring and other costs of 154 million in 2020 compared to 210 million in 2019 

this decrease was partially offset by 

• higher employee compensation incentive expense compared to the prior year 

net interest expense 

the 206 percent decrease in net interest expense in 2020 from 2019 was the result of 

• cross currency swaps entered into in june 2019 and december 2019 resulting in more interest income in 2020 than in the prior period 

• lower interest rate revolving credit facilities replacing higher interest rate fixed rate debt that matured during the second half of 2019 and 

• strong cash flows in 2020 leading to lower overall debt levels 

provision for income taxes 

the 62 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to 

• the unfavorable impact of discrete items including items related to the cares act and items related to final regulations as part of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 that place limitations on the deductibility of certain interest expense for us tax purposes 

2019 comparison with 2018 

a discussion of changes in our consolidated results of operations and liquidity and capital resources from the year ended december 31 2019 to december 31 2018 can be found in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 which was filed with the sec on february 25 2020 however such discussion is not incorporated by reference into and does not constitute a part of this annual report on form 10k 

segment results of operations 

the summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of our two reportable segments consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies each of these segments is comprised of various product offerings that serve multiple end users 

we evaluate performance based on net sales and segment income and use a variety of ratios to measure performance of our reporting segments segment income represents equity income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and operating income exclusive of intangible amortization certain acquisition related expenses costs of restructuring activities impairments and other unusual nonoperating items 

consumer solutions 

the net sales and segment income for consumer solutions were as follows 



net sales 

the components of the change in consumer solutions net sales were as follows 



the 81 percent increase in net sales for consumer solutions in 2020 from 2019 was primarily the result of 

• increased sales volume across several of the product lines in our pool business due to consumers’ desire to invest in their pools and backyards while shelteringinplace due to the covid19 pandemic 

• higher sales volumes in our residential filtration product lines in north america and china during the second half of 2020 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate impacts of inflation and 

• increased sales due to the aquion and pelican acquisitions that occurred in february 2019 and other small acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2019 and during 2020 

this increase was partially offset by 

• sales decreases for 2020 due to lower demand in the water treatment business as governmentmandated shutdown and shelterinplace orders and commercial closures due to the covid19 pandemic impacting the ability to reach customers and 

• higherthanusual rebate activity that lowered price due to sales growth in our pool business 

the 21 percent increase in net sales for consumer solutions in 2019 from 2018 was primarily the result of 

• increased sales due to the acquisitions of aquion and pelican in the first quarter of 2019 and 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases 

this increase was partially offset by 

• sales volume declines in our pool business due to cold wet weather during the first half of 2019 in key markets 

• higher than anticipated inventory levels in some of our key distribution channels impacting our pool business during the first nine months of 2019 

• sales volume declines in our residential and commercial components business and 

• unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to the same period of the prior year 

segment income 

the components of the change in consumer solutions segment income from the prior period were as follows 



the 04 percentage point increase in segment income for consumer solutions as a percentage of net sales in 2020 from 2019 was primarily the result of 

• increased sales volume in our pool business 

• reduction in travel and entertainment trade show and advertising expenses due to the covid19 pandemic and other cost reduction initiatives 

• impact of aquion and pelican acquisitions and 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate the impacts of inflation 

this increase was partially offset by 

• lower sales volume in the higher margin commercial filtration business 

• higher sales rebates and employee incentive compensation expense in line with increased sales in our pool business 

• higher transportation and labor costs due to increased demand in our pool business and 

• inflationary increases related to certain raw materials 

the 13 percentage point decrease in segment income for consumer solutions as a percentage of net sales in 2019 from 2018 was primarily the result of 

• declines in core sales volume in our pool business resulting in unfavorable sales mix 

• increased investment in both research and development and sales and marketing to drive growth and 

• inflationary increases related to raw material and labor costs 

this decrease was partially offset by 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases and 

• productivity and cost savings generated from pims initiatives including lean and supply management practices 

industrial  flow technologies 

the net sales and segment income for industrial  flow technologies were as follows 



net sales 

the components of the change in industrial  flow technologies net sales were as follows 



the 52 percent decrease in net sales for industrial  flow technologies in 2020 from 2019 was primarily the result of 

• decreased sales volume in our commercial water supply and water disposal industrial filtration and food and beverage businesses due to less project sales as a result of customers deferring their capital spending and less service and aftermarket revenue driven by reduced consumption and travel restrictions from governmentmandated shutdowns and “shelterinplace” orders due to the covid19 pandemic 

• decreased sales volume in our residential and irrigation flow businesses in the first half of 2020 due to market conditions resulting from the covid19 pandemic 

this decrease was partially offset by 

• increased sales volume in our residential and irrigation flow businesses in the second half of 2020 due to strong demand in the residential water supply water disposal and specialty spray product lines 

• sales growth in our infrastructure business as a result of strong backlog entering 2020 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases and 

• favorable foreign currency effects compared to the same period of the prior year 

the 30 percent decrease in net sales for industrial  flow technologies in 2019 from 2018 was primarily the result of 

• decreased sales volume in our agriculturerelated business due to cold wet weather in the first half of 2019 

• unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to the same period of the prior year and 

• the impact of divestitures in our agriculturerelated business in brazil and commercial flow business in australia 

this decrease was partially offset by 

• increased sales volume in our industrial filtration and food and beverage businesses and 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases 

segment income 

the components of the change in industrial  flow technologies segment income from the prior period were as follows 



the 19 percentage point decrease in segment income for industrial  flow technologies as a percentage of net sales in 2020 from 2019 was primarily the result of 

• decreased sales volumes in our residential and irrigation flow business in the first half of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic which resulted in decreased leverage on fixed operating expenses 

• decreased sales volume in our commercial water supply and water disposal industrial filtration and food and beverage businesses due to the covid19 pandemic along with unfavorable mix within our commercial and infrastructure flow and industrial filtration businesses and 

• inflationary increases related to raw material and labor costs 

this decrease was partially offset by 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases 

• lower sales incentive expense in line with decreased sales and 

• increased productivity due to cost actions driving manufacturing efficiencies and lower operating expenses 

the 05 percentage point increase in segment income for industrial  flow technologies as a percentage of net sales in 2019 from 2018 was primarily the result of 

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases 

• increased productivity and 

• increased volume and favorable mix in our industrial filtration and food and beverage businesses 

this increase was partially offset by 

• inflationary increases related to raw material and labor costs 

backlog of orders by segment 



a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and products delivered in the same month our backlog typically has a short manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order however a portion of our backlog particularly from orders for major capital projects can take more than one year depending on the size and type of order we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract the increase in our backlog at december 31 2020 compared to 2019 was mainly a result of increased demand in our pool business we expect the majority of our backlog at december 31 2020 will be shipped in 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings our primary revolving credit facility has generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities or completed debt and equity offerings as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets consistent with historical trends we experienced seasonal cash usage in the first quarter of 2020 and drew on our revolving credit facility to repay commercial paper and to fund our operations this cash usage reversed in the second quarter of 2020 as the seasonality of our businesses peaked consistent with historical seasonal patterns the second quarter of 2020 generated significant cash to fund our operations and we used this cash to significantly reduce the draw on our revolving credit facility we continued to experience strong cash flow in the second half of 2020 causing our revolving credit facility balance to remain low at december 31 2020 compared to the prior year end 

enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs 

generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperature heavy flooding and droughts 

we expect to continue to have sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe our existing liquidity position coupled with our currently anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months although the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our future results is uncertain we believe we are wellpositioned to manage our business and have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash internally generated funds and borrowing under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities we are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and a solid liquidity position 

summary of cash flows 

cash flows from continuing operations were as follows 



operating activities 

in 2020 net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations primarily reflects net income from continuing operations of 4322 million net of noncash depreciation and amortization additionally the company had a cash inflow of 1095 million as a result of changes in net working capital primarily the result of accounts receivables collections and reduced accounts receivables due to the pool business early buy program shipments with extended payment terms moving from the fourth quarter of 2020 into 2021 due to continued strong demand 

in 2019 net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations primarily reflects net income from continuing operations of 4629 million net of noncash depreciation amortization and asset impairment partially offset by a cash outflow of 1054 million as a result of changes in net working capital and 209 million of pension and other postretirement plan contributions including 111 million of contributions made in conjunction with the termination of the pentair salaried plan during 2019 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities of continuing operations in 2020 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 622 million and cash paid for acquisitions of 580 million in our consumer solutions reporting segment net of cash acquired 

net cash used for investing activities of continuing operations in 2019 primarily reflects capital expenditures of 585 million and cash paid for the aquion and pelican acquisitions partially offset by 153 million of proceeds received from divestitures primarily related to our former aquaculture business 

financing activities 

in 2020 net cash used for financing activities primarily relates to repayment of commercial paper and revolving longterm debt of 1175 million repayment of the 3625 senior notes due in 2020 of 740 million 1502 million of share repurchases and dividend payments of 1271 million 

in 2019 net cash used for financing activities primarily relates to repayment of senior notes due in 2019 totaling 4015 million 1500 million of share repurchases and payment of dividends of 1227 million partially offset by proceeds from longterm debt of 6000 million and net receipts of commercial paper and revolving longterm debt of 515 million 

free cash flow 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends repurchase shares and repay debt in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 



debt and capital 

in april 2018 pentair pentair investments switzerland gmbh “pisg” pentair finance sà rl “pfsa“ and pentair inc entered into a credit agreement providing for an 8000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a term of five years the “senior credit facility” with pentair and pisg as guarantors and pfsa and pentair inc as borrowers in june 2020 pentair assumed the pisg guarantee the senior credit facility has a maturity date of april 25 2023 borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an adjusted base rate or the london interbank offered rate plus in each case an applicable margin the applicable margin is based on at pfsa’s election pentair’s leverage level or pfsa’s public credit rating in may 2019 pfsa executed an increase of the senior credit facility by 1000 million for a total commitment up to 9000 million in the aggregate 

in december 2019 the senior credit facility was amended to provide for the extension of term loans in an aggregate amount of 2000 million the “term loans” the term loans are in addition to the senior credit facility commitment in addition pfsa has the option to further increase the senior credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to 3000 million through a combination of increases to the total commitment amount of the senior credit facility andor one or more tranches of term loans in addition to the term loans subject to customary conditions including the commitment of the participating lenders 

pfsa is authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the senior credit facility pfsa uses the senior credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding pfsa had no commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2020 and 1178 million as of december 31 2019 all of which was classified as longterm debt as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the senior credit facility 

in march 2020 the commercial paper market began to experience high levels of volatility due to uncertainty related to the covid19 pandemic the volatility impacted both market access to and pricing of commercial paper as a cost mitigation action we withdrew our credit ratings to access the commercial paper market in the second quarter of 2020 and continued to use the revolving credit facility along with cash generated from operations to fund our general operations as of december 31 2020 total availability under the senior credit facility was 8639 million 

our debt agreements contain various financial covenants but the most restrictive covenants are contained in the senior credit facility the senior credit facility contains covenants requiring us not to permit i the ratio of our consolidated debt net of our consolidated unrestricted cash in excess of 50 million but not to exceed 2500 million to our consolidated net income excluding among other things noncash gains and losses before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash sharebased compensation expense “ebitda” on the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to exceed 375 to 100 the “leverage ratio” and ii the ratio of our ebitda to our consolidated interest expense for the same period to be less than 300 to 100 as of the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of the leverage ratio the senior credit facility provides for the calculation of ebitda giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates our debt agreements contain various financial covenants as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements

as of december 31 2020 we had 569 million of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences 

we expect to continue to have sufficient cash and borrowing capacity to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

standby letters of credit bank guarantees and bonds 

in certain situations tyco international ltd pentair ltd’s former parent company “tyco” guaranteed performance by the flow control business of pentair ltd “flow control” to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of flow control in situations where flow control and tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spinoff of flow control from tyco we will indemnify tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the outstanding value of bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 991 million and 913 million respectively 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

• it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate and 

• changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we perform our annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the relevant reporting unit with its carrying amount we would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test however we may elect to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test even if no indications of a potential impairment exist 

during 2020 a quantitative assessment was performed the fair value of each reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry the nonrecurring fair value measurement is a “level 3” measurement under the fair value hierarchy for the 2020 annual impairment test the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value in each of our reporting units therefore no impairment charge was required 

during 2019 a qualitative assessment was performed we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values factors considered in the analysis included the last discounted cash flow fair value assessment of reporting units and the calculated excess fair value over carrying amount financial performance forecasts and trends market capitalization regulatory and environmental issues macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations raw material costs and management stability we also consider the extent to which each of the adverse events and circumstances identified affect the comparison of the respective reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying amount we place more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect the respective reporting unit’s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets we consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that may affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names proprietary technology and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test the first day of the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization 

the impairment test for trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the nonrecurring fair value measurement is a “level 3” measurement under the fair value hierarchy 

there was no impairment charge recorded in any of the years presented for identifiable intangible assets 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor us and nonus definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other postretirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year “marktomarket adjustment” and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other postretirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments marktomarket adjustments resulted in a pretax loss of 67 million in 2020 a pretax gain of 34 million in 2019 and a pretax loss of 36 million in 2018 the remaining components of pension expense including service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense 

discount rates 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds rated aa or higher available in the marketplace there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumptions that will impact our pension expense in 2021 

expected rate of return 

the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longterm market indices 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarial determined estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2020 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 72 fixedrate debt and 28 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2020 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 376 million decrease or 409 million increase in fair value respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2020 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 24 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are generally the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk at december 31 2020 we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with gross notional us dollar equivalent amounts of 124 million changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income when the hedged item affects earnings 

at december 31 2020 we had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a combined notional amount of 8551 million the cross currency swap agreements are accounted for as either cash flow hedges to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt or as net investment hedges to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange rate the currency risk related to the cross currency swap agreements is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 637 million net increase in accumulated other comprehensive income conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in an 570 million net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income however these increases and decreases in other comprehensive income would be offset by decreases or increases in the hedged items on our balance sheet

new segmentation 

during the first quarter of 2020 we reorganized our business segments to better align our organization with our strategies and to better align with our customer base resulting in a change to our reporting segments in 2020 we believe the new alignment into a businesstoconsumer focused segment consumer solutions and primarily businesstobusiness driven segment industrial  flow technologies better positions our teams to build upon our core strengths more aggressively pursue our growth opportunities increase productivity and enhance profitability 

as part of this reorganization the legacy aquatic systems reporting segment was combined with the residential and commercial systems and components businesses of the legacy filtrations solutions reporting segment to form the consumer solutions reporting segment in addition the industrial filtration and food and beverage businesses of the legacy filtration solutions reporting segment were combined with the legacy flow technologies reporting segment to form the industrial  flow technologies reporting segment all segment information presented throughout this annual report on form 10k with exception of the table below was prepared based on the reporting segments in place during 2019 

the below table presents net sales and segment income under the revised reporting segments consumer solutions and industrial  flow technologies for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 



information regarding all reportable segments 

backlog of orders by segment 



a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and products delivered in the same month our backlog typically has a short manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order however a portion of our backlog particularly from orders for major capital projects can take more than one year depending on the size and type of order we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract we expect the majority of our backlog at december 31 2019 will be shipped in 2020  

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities these efforts consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes 

raw materials 

the principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies copper and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

we purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future 

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trademark trade name or brand name 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the termination of patents patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of december 31 2019  we employed approximately 9500 people worldwide

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document 

risks relating to our business 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial commercial and residential markets we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and results of operations due to economic and business cycles important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the global economy and various regional economies and our customers’ confidence in these economies industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets the residential housing market the commercial business climate unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates and energy and commodity prices the businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of the above factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could reduce demand for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us we compete based on technical expertise intellectual property reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms service offerings customer experience and service and price competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us some of our competitors in particular smaller companies attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price moreover demand for our products which impacts profit margins is affected by changes in customer order patterns such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases and changes in customers’ preferences for our products including the success of products offered by our competitors customer purchasing behavior may also shift by product mix in the market or result in a shift to new distribution channels including ecommerce which is a rapidly developing area if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and solutions or adapt to changes in customer purchasing behavior or shifts in distribution channels or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2019 accounted for 37 of our net sales our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principal nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could have a 

material adverse effect on our reported revenue in future periods in addition currency variations could have a material adverse effect on margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the us and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the us 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to transform and adapt our products services solutions and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to transform and adapt our products services solutions organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target end markets and develop or acquire competitive technologies products services and solutions and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively the failure to effectively adapt our products services or solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to identify finance and complete suitable acquisitions and investments and any completed acquisitions and investments may be unsuccessful or consume significant resources 

our business strategy includes acquiring businesses and making investments that complement our existing businesses we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product service and solution offerings we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain financing or have sufficient cash necessary for acquisitions or successfully complete acquisitions in the future any acquisitions that we complete may not be successful acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

it may be difficult for us to integrate acquired operations including those from our recent acquisitions of aquion inc and pelican water systems efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions or investments may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our business initiatives 

during 2019  2018 and 2017  we initiated and continued execution of certain business initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business as a result we have incurred substantial expense including restructuring charges we may not be able to achieve the operating efficiencies to reduce costs or realize benefits that were anticipated in connection with these initiatives if we are unable to execute these initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  

we are exposed to political regulatory economic trade and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2019 accounted for 37 of our net sales further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from nonus suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic trade and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 



 

in 2016 the united kingdom voted in a referendum to exit the european union “brexit” which resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility the brexit bill was passed by the united kingdom on january 23 2020 and it was passed by the european parliament on january 29 2020 the united kingdom’s exit from the european union became effective on january 31 2020 given the lack of comparable precedent the implications of brexit or how such implications might affect our company continue to remain unclear at this time brexit could among other impacts disrupt trade and the movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

changes in us or foreign government administrative policy including changes to existing trade agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 

as a result of changes to us or foreign government administrative policy there may be changes to existing trade agreements like the north american free trade agreement “nafta” and its anticipated successor agreement the usmexicocanada agreement “usmca” which is still subject to approval by canada greater restrictions on free trade generally and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the us particularly tariffs on products manufactured in mexico china or other us trading countries where we have operations or manufacture or sell products among other possible changes if the usmca is ratified by canada its provisions will go into effect shortly thereafter while the usmca is somewhat similar to nafta it contains several new compliance obligations addressing such issues as rules of origin labor standard certificate of origin documentation and de minimis thresholds as well as new policies on labor and environmental standards intellectual property protections and some digital trade provisions we are currently analyzing the expected impact of the usmca while certain aspects of the usmca are expected to be positive others including potentially higher regulatory compliance costs may have an adverse impact on our business it remains unclear what the us administration or foreign governments including china will or will not do with respect to tariffs nafta usmca or other international trade agreements and policies a trade war other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements including nafta and usmca changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products and any resulting negative sentiments towards the us as a result of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience cost and other inflation 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs including wages pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs however these actions may not be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant as of december 31 2019 our goodwill and intangible assets were 2598 million and represented 63 of our total assets declines in fair market value could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 

a loss of or material cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by one or more of our largest customers could harm our business 

our net sales to our largest customer represented approximately 15 of our consolidated net sales in 2019  while we do not have any other customers that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales in 2019  we have other customers that are key to the success of our business our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of larger customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business our success is dependent on retaining these customers which requires us to successfully manage relationships and anticipate the needs of our customers in the channels in which we sell our products our customers also may be impacted by economic conditions in the industries of those customers which could result in reduced demand for our products we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain our largest customers in addition some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by these customers or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

catastrophic and other events beyond our control may disrupt operations at our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers which could cause us to be unable to meet customer demands or increase our costs or reduce customer spending 

if operations at any of our manufacturing facilities or those of our suppliers were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters earthquakes power outages fires explosions terrorism adverse weather conditions labor disputes public health epidemics or other catastrophic events or events outside of our control we may be unable to fill customer orders and otherwise meet customer demand for our products in addition these types of events may negatively impact residential commercial and industrial spending in impacted regions or depending on the severity globally as a result any of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows for example we are evaluating the potential impact of the coronavirus covid19 outbreak that originated in china including evaluating the impact on our employees customers and global supply chain and of governmental actions being taken to curtail the spread of the virus the significance of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak to us remains unclear at this time however it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows interruptions in production in particular at our manufacturing facilities could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to fill customer orders we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand with endcustomers and endusers within each of our business segments demand for pool equipment in the pool business water treatment solutions in our water solutions and industrial filtration businesses and residential water supply infrastructure and agricultural products in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august while we attempt to mitigate the magnitude of the sales spike in the pool business and in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment by 

employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts we cannot provide any assurance that such programs will be successful in addition seasonal effects in the pool business and in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment may vary from year to year and be impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperature heavy flooding and droughts moreover adverse weather conditions such as cold or wet weather may negatively impact demand for and sales of pool equipment in the pool business and residential water supply commercial infrastructure and agricultural products in the businesses within the industrial  flow technologies segment 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants including those that limit the amount of our debt which may restrict the operations of our business and our ability to incur additional debt to finance acquisitions our ability to meet the financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital our credit ratings may be downgraded in the future or our interest rates may increase each of which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2019  we had 10291 million of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate if our cash requirements are more than we expect or if we intend to finance acquisitions we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets may become restricted additionally our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded in addition borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loans bear interest at a rate equal to an adjusted base rate or the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus in each case an applicable margin the uk financial conduct authority which regulates libor has announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor after 2021 the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loans provides procedures for determining a replacement or alternative base rate in the event that libor is discontinued however any calculation of interest based upon such replacement or alternative base rate may result in higher interest rates to the extent that our interest rates increase our interest expense will increase which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to 

access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our shares may trade the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our share price 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws outside the us could have a material adverse effect on us 

the fcpa uk bribery act and other anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may require selfdisclosure to government agencies and result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations and changes in us government sanctions could have a material adverse effect on us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are “dual use” products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

we are exposed to potential environmental laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to us federal state local and nonus laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as defendant target or a potentially responsible party “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former businesses we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of cleanup and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities could exceed the amount of our current reserves 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials substantially all of which relate to our discontinued operations these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between several dozen to more than a hundred corporate defendants historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and only where appropriate settling claims before trial as of december 31 2019  there were approximately 730 claims pending against our subsidiaries substantially all of which relate to our discontinued operations we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit 

greenhouse gas emissions the us environmental protection agency “epa” has published findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases “ghgs” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are according to the epa contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climate changes based on these findings the epa has implemented regulations that require reporting of ghg emissions or that limit emissions of ghgs from certain mobile or stationary sources in addition the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have considered other legislation and regulatory proposals to reduce emissions of ghgs and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the development of ghg inventories ghg permitting andor regional ghg capandtrade programs it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program or other state programs may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol andor the paris accord and these and other existing international initiatives and regulations or those under consideration could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly our energy and industrial customers are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services in addition as customers become increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their purchases if we fail to keep up with changing regulations or innovate in ways that minimize the energy use of our products customers may choose more energy efficient alternatives these actions could also increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation it is uncertain what laws will be enacted and therefore we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased information technology security threats and computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services and we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties as our business increasingly interfaces with employees customers dealers and suppliers using information technology systems and networks we are subject to an increased risk to the secure operation of these systems and networks our evolution into smart products internet of things businesstoconsumer and ecommerce subjects us to increased cyber and technology risks the secure operation of our information technology systems and networks is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain establishing systems and processes to address these threats may increase our costs we have experienced data breaches and although we have determined such data breaches to be immaterial and such data breaches have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows there can be no assurance of similar results in the future should future attacks succeed in the theft of assets exporting sensitive data or financial information or controlling sensitive systems or networks it could expose us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers to the theft of assets misuse of information or systems compromising of confidential information manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

changes in data privacy laws and our ability to comply with them could have a material adverse effect on us 

we collect and store data that is sensitive to pentair and its employees customers dealers and suppliers a variety of state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal and other data many foreign data privacy regulations including the gdpr which became effective in the european union in 2018 are more stringent than federal regulations in the united states within the united states many states are considering adopting or have already adopted privacy regulations including for example the california consumer privacy act these laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and changing and could have an adverse effect on our operations companies’ obligations and requirements under these laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty in how they may be interpreted by courts and governmental authorities the costs of compliance with and the other burdens imposed by these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs andor result in interruptions or delays in the availability of systems in the case of noncompliance of these laws including the gdpr regulators have the authority to levy significant fines in addition if there is a breach of privacy we may be required to make notifications under data privacy regulations the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and other claims 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to litigation and other claims these legal proceedings are typically claims that relate to the products or to the conduct of our business and include without limitation claims relating to commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property matters environmental safety and health matters product liability the use or installation of our products consumer protection matters and employment and labor matters the outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to us we also may not have insurance that covers such claims while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms and this insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims further some of our business involves the sale of our products to customers that are constructing large and complex systems facilities or other capital projects and while we generally try to limit our exposure liquidated damages consequential damages and other damages in the contracts for these projects we could be exposed to significant monetary damages and other liabilities in connection with the sale of our products for these projects for a variety of reasons in addition some of our businesses customers and dealers are subject to various laws and regulations regarding consumer protection and advertising and sales practices and we have been named and may be named in the future as a defendant in litigation some of which are or may be class action complaints arising from alleged violation of these laws and regulations successful claims or litigation against us for significant amounts could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our focus on consumer solutions for residential and commercial water treatment as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

as we introduce residential and commercial water solutions we may have limited experience in markets we choose to enter and our customers may not like our value propositions new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results designing marketing and executing these solutions is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

 these expanded risks increase the complexity of our business and place significant responsibility on our management employees operations systems technical expertise financial resources and internal controls and compliance functions 

risks relating to the separation of nvent electric plc by spinoff 

the spinoff transaction could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders if the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction 

on april 30 2018 we completed the separation of our electrical business through the spinoff of nvent electric plc to our shareholders the spinoff was conditioned on our receipt of opinions of tax advisors and tax rulings from taxing authorities however these tax opinions will not be binding on taxing authorities accordingly taxing authorities or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in such opinions moreover such opinions were based on certain statements and representations made by us which if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect could invalidate the opinions if the spinoff and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable we could be subject to a substantial tax liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoff were taxable each holder of our ordinary shares who received shares of nvent electric plc in the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff we and nvent electric plc entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement and an employee matters agreement these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the spinoff and provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations the indemnity rights we have against nvent under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us in addition our indemnity obligations to nvent may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in ireland and tax residency in the uk 

we are subject to changes in law and other factors that may not allow us to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry 

while we believe that we should be able to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate also the tax laws of the us the uk ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate these changes include the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in the us in december 2017 which made significant changes to certain us tax laws relevant to us including limitations on the deductibility of certain interest expense and employee compensation limitations on various other deductions and credits the imposition of taxes in respect of certain crossborder payments or transfers the imposition of taxes on certain earnings of nonus entities on a current basis and changes in the timing of the recognition of income or its character these items and regulations and guidance implementing the tax cuts and jobs act could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods in addition legislative action could be taken by the us the uk ireland or the european union that could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulations upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to maintain tax residency in the uk and take advantage of the tax treaties among the us the uk and ireland we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

a change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges 

under current irish legislation a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in ireland if it is centrally managed and controlled in ireland or in certain circumstances if it is incorporated in ireland under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the uk is regarded as resident in the uk for taxation purposes unless it is treated as resident in another jurisdiction pursuant to any appropriate double tax treaty with the uk other jurisdictions may also seek to assert taxing jurisdiction over pentair 

  

where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the uk and ireland article 43 of the double tax convention between ireland and the uk the “residence tiebreaker” historically provided that the company should be treated as resident only in one of those two jurisdictions if its place of effective management is situated in that jurisdiction 

the organization for economic cooperation and development proposed a number of measures relating to the tax treatment of multinationals some of which are implemented by amending double tax treaties through a multilateral instrument the “mli” the mli has now entered into force for a number of countries including ireland and the uk under the mli the residence tiebreaker is amended so that a company will not cease being dual resident until there is a determination by the tax authorities of the two contracting states instead of an objective application of the place of effective management test 

under ireland’s domestic tax residency rules pentair should not be irish resident until january 1 2021 provided that there is no change in ownership and no major change in the nature or conduct of the business of the company before that date in which case the residence tiebreaker should apply from the date of the change of ownership accordingly we do not expect the change to the residence tiebreaker to have effect until january 1 2021 at the earliest 

it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of our affairs we could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the uk if pentair ceases to be resident in the uk and becomes resident in another jurisdiction it may be subject to uk exit charges and could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction including dividend withholding taxes or corporate income tax charges if pentair were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction it could be subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions if for example pentair were considered to be a tax resident of ireland we could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by it could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of our ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company “dtc” will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold your ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 percent of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases we may in our absolute discretion pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay any stamp duty our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii will have a lien against the shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in our shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us 

our ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax “cat” could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €335000 per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents for periods on or after october 9 2019

 item 2 properties 

our principal office is located in leased premises in london uk and our management office in the us is located in leased premises in minneapolis minnesota 

our operations are conducted in facilities throughout the world these facilities house manufacturing and distribution operations as well as sales and marketing engineering and administrative offices the following is a summary of our principal properties as of december 31 2019 including manufacturing distribution sales offices and service centers 



we believe that our production facilities as well as the related machinery and equipment are well maintained and suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses   




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we have been and in the future may be made parties to a number of actions filed or have been and in the future may be given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those relating to commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property matters environmental safety and health matters product liability the use or installation of our products consumer matters and employment and labor matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other unaffiliated companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between several dozen to more than a hundred corporate defendants our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2019  there were approximately 730 claims outstanding against our subsidiaries this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

environmental matters 

we have been named as defendant target or a prp in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known as of december 31 2019  our recorded reserves for environmental matters were not material we do not anticipate our remaining environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities or completed debt and equity offerings as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions we generally issue commercial paper to fund our financing needs on a shortterm basis and use our revolving credit facility as backup liquidity to support commercial paper 

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade credit ratings and a solid liquidity position 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was 3452 million in 2019  compared to 4581 million in 2018 and 2786 million in 2017  

the 3452 million in net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2019 primarily reflects net income from continuing operations of 4629 million  net of noncash depreciation amortization and asset impairment partially offset by a negative impact of 1054 million as a result of changes in net working capital and 209 million of pension and other postretirement plan contributions including 111 million of contributions made in conjunction with the termination of the pentair salaried plan during 2019

the 2786 million in net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2017 primarily reflects net income from continuing operations of 3183 million  net of noncash depreciation amortization asset impairment and the loss on early extinguishment of debt partially offset by a negative impact of 873 million as a result of changes in net working capital 

investing activities

net cash provided by investing activities of continuing operations in 2017 primarily reflects the sale of the valves  controls business partially offset by capital expenditures of 391 million and cash paid of 459 million to acquire a business as part of filtration solutions 

financing activities 

cash used for financing activities was 171 million in 2019  compared to 4079 million and 34326 million in 2018 and 2017  respectively 

in 2019  net cash used for financing activities primarily relates to repayment of senior notes due in 2019 totaling 4015 million  1500 million of share repurchases and payment of dividends of 1227 million  partially offset by proceeds from longterm debt of 6000 million and net receipts of commercial paper and revolving longterm debt of 515 million  

as described below in 2018 we utilized 9936 million of cash distributed from the separation to repay commercial paper and revolving longterm debt and for the early extinguishment of certain series of fixed rate debt additionally we repurchased 5000 million of shares and made dividend payments of 1872 million  

in 2017 net cash used for financing activities primarily related to the utilization of proceeds from the sale of the valves  controls business to repay our commercial paper and revolving longterm debt and for the early extinguishment of certain series of fixed rate debt additionally we repurchased 2000 million of shares and made dividend payments of 2517 million

in april 2018 pentair pisg pfsa and pentair inc entered into a credit agreement providing for an 8000 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a term of five years the “senior credit facility” with pentair and pisg as guarantors and pfsa and pentair inc as borrowers the senior credit facility has a maturity date of april 25 2023 borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an adjusted base rate or the london interbank offered rate plus in each case an applicable margin the applicable margin is based on at pfsa’s election pentair’s leverage level or pfsa’s public credit rating in may 2019 pfsa executed an increase of the senior credit facility by 1000 million for a total commitment up to 9000 million in the aggregate 

in december 2019 the senior credit facility was amended to provide for the extension of term loans in an aggregate amount of 2000 million the “term loans” the term loans are in addition to the senior credit facility commitment in addition pfsa has the option to further increase the senior credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to 3000 million  through a combination of increases to the total commitment amount of the senior credit facility andor one or more tranches of term loans in addition to the term loans subject to customary conditions including the commitment of the participating lenders 

as of december 31 2019  total availability under the senior credit facility was 7464 million  

pfsa is authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the senior credit facility pfsa uses the senior credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding pfsa had 1178 million of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2019 and 760 million as of december 31 2018  all of which was classified as longterm debt as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the senior credit facility 

our debt agreements contain various financial covenants but the most restrictive covenants are contained in the senior credit facility the senior credit facility contains covenants requiring us not to permit i the ratio of our consolidated debt net of its consolidated unrestricted cash in excess of 50 million but not to exceed 2500 million  to our consolidated net income excluding among other things noncash gains and losses before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash sharebased compensation expense “ebitda” on the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to exceed 375 to 100 the “leverage ratio” and ii the ratio of our ebitda to our consolidated interest expense for the same period to be less than 300 to 100 as of the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of the leverage ratio the senior credit facility provides for the calculation of ebitda giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements 

in addition to the senior credit facility we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of 210 million  of which there were no outstanding borrowings at december 31 2019  borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 

in june 2018 we used the 9936 million of cash received from nvent as a result of the distribution to pay down commercial paper and revolving credit facilities redeem the remaining 2553 million aggregate principal of our 29 fixed rate senior notes due 2018 and complete a cash tender offer in the amount of €3634 million aggregate principal of our 245 senior notes due 2019 all costs associated with the repurchases of debt were recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  including 160 million premium paid on early extinguishment and 11 million of unamortized deferred financing costs 

we have 740 million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes maturing in 2020  we classified this debt as longterm as of december 31 2019 as we have the intent and ability to refinance such obligation on a longterm basis under the senior credit facility 

as of december 31 2019  we had 588 million of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

authorized shares

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 



the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business for purposes of the above table arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2019  variable interest rate debt was 3536 million at a weighted average interest rate of 271  

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2019 was estimated to be 474 million  we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2019  we had recorded 04 million for the possible payment of penalties and 37 million related to the possible payment of interest 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2019  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

commitments and contingencies 

we have been and in the future may be made parties to a number of actions filed or have been and in the future may be given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those relating to commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property matters environmental safety and health matters product liability the use or installation of our products consumer matters and employment and labor matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

standby letters of credit bank guarantees and bonds 

in certain situations tyco international ltd pentair ltd’s former parent company “tyco” guaranteed performance by the flow control business of pentair ltd “flow control” to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of flow control in situations where flow control and tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spinoff of flow control from tyco we will indemnify tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the outstanding value of bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 913 million and 1236 million  respectively 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired a qualitative assessment is first performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value if it is concluded that this is the case an evaluation based upon discounted cash flows is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows growth rates and economic and market conditions 

as a result of the qualitative assessment performed as of october 1 2019 and 2018 it was determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values factors considered in the analysis included the last discounted cash flow fair value assessment of reporting units performed in 2017 and the calculated excess fair value over carrying amount financial performance forecasts and trends market capitalization regulatory and environmental issues macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations raw material costs and management stability we also consider the extent to which each of the adverse events and circumstances identified affect the comparison of the respective reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying amount we place more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect the respective reporting unit’s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets we consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that may affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names proprietary technology and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test the first day of the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization 

the impairment test for trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the nonrecurring fair value measurement is a “level 3” measurement under the fair value hierarchy 

there were no impairment charges recorded in 2019 or 2018 for identifiable intangible assets an impairment charge of 88 million was recorded in 2017 related to certain trade names in filtration solutions and flow technologies as a result of lower forecasted sales volume or rebranding strategies implemented in the fourth quarter of 2017 the trade name impairment charges were recorded in selling general and administrative in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor us and nonus definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other postretirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year “marktomarket adjustment” and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other postretirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments marktomarket adjustments resulted in a pretax gain of 34 million in 2019  and a pretax loss of 36 million and 85 million in 2018 and 2017  respectively the remaining components of pension expense including service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense 

discount rates 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds rated aa or higher available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumptions that will impact our pension expense in 2020  

expected rate of return 

the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longterm market indices 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2019  was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 66 fixedrate debt and 34 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2019  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 398 million decrease or 434 million increase in fair value respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2019  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 35 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are generally the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk at december 31 2019 and 2018  we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with gross notional us dollar equivalent amounts of 170 million and 476 million  respectively changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income when the hedged item affects earnings 

at december 31 2019 we had outstanding cross currency swap agreements with a combined notional amount of 7770 million  the cross currency swap agreements are accounted for as either cash flow hedges to hedge foreign currency fluctuations on certain intercompany debt or as net investment hedges to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the eurous dollar exchange rate the currency risk related to the cross currency swap agreements is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 579 million net increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss  conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 552 million net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss  however these increases and decreases in other comprehensive income would be offset by decreases or increases in the hedged items on our balance sheet

information regarding all reportable segments 

backlog of orders by segment 



a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and products delivered in the same month our backlog typically has a short manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order however a portion of our backlog particularly from orders for major capital projects can take more than one year depending on the size and type of order we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract we expect the majority of our backlog at december 31 2018  will be shipped in 2019  

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities these efforts consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes 

raw materials 

the principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies copper and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

we purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document 

risks relating to our business 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial commercial and residential markets we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and results of operations due to economic and business cycles important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets the residential housing market the commercial business climate unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates and energy and commodity prices the businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of the above factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could reduce demand for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers we compete based on technical expertise intellectual property reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms service offerings customer experience and service and price some of our competitors in particular smaller companies attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and solutions or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2018  accounted for 37  of our net sales our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principal nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenue in future periods in addition currency variations could have a material adverse effect on margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the us and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the us 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire competitive products and services and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively the failure to effectively adapt our products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to identify finance and complete suitable acquisitions and investments and any completed acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources 

our business strategy includes acquiring businesses and making investments that complement our existing businesses we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and service offerings we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain financing or have sufficient cash necessary for acquisitions or successfully complete acquisitions in the future any acquisitions that we complete may not be successful acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

it may be difficult for us to integrate acquired operations including those from our recent acquisitions of aquion inc and pelican water systems efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions or investments may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our business initiatives 

during 2018  2017  and 2016  we initiated and continued execution of certain business initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business as a result we have incurred substantial expense including restructuring charges we may not be able to achieve the operating efficiencies to reduce costs or realize benefits that were anticipated in connection with these initiatives if we are unable to execute these initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  

we are exposed to political regulatory economic trade and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2018  accounted for 37  of our net sales further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from nonus suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic trade and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 

in 2016 the united kingdom voted in a referendum to exit the european union “brexit” which resulted in significant currency exchange rate fluctuations and volatility negotiations continue to determine the terms of brexit given the lack of comparable precedent and the status of the negotiations the implications of brexit or how such implications might affect our company continue to remain unclear at this time brexit could among other impacts disrupt trade and the movement of goods services and people between the united kingdom and the european union or other countries as well as create legal and global economic uncertainty 

our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

changes in us or foreign government administrative policy including changes to existing trade agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 

as a result of changes to us or foreign government administrative policy there may be changes to existing trade agreements like the north american free trade agreement “nafta” and its anticipated successor agreement the usmexicocanada agreement “usmca” which is still subject to approval by the us mexico and canada greater restrictions on free trade generally and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the us particularly tariffs on products manufactured in mexico china or other us trading countries where we have operations or manufacture or sell products among other possible changes if the usmca is ratified by all three countries many of its provisions will not take effect until 2020 while the usmca is somewhat similar to nafta it contains several new compliance obligations addressing such issues as rules of origin labor standard certificate of origin documentation and de minimis thresholds as well as new policies on labor and environmental standards intellectual property protections and some digital trade provisions we are currently analyzing the expected impact of the usmca while certain aspects of the usmca are expected to be positive others including potentially higher regulatory compliance costs may have an adverse impact on our business it remains unclear what the us 

administration or foreign governments including china will or will not do with respect to tariffs nafta usmca or other international trade agreements and policies a trade war other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements including nafta and usmca changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products and any resulting negative sentiments towards the us as a result of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may experience cost and other inflation 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs including wages pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs however these actions may not be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant as of december 31 2018  our goodwill and intangible assets were 2349 million  and represented 62  of our total assets declines in fair market value could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 

a loss of or material cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by one or more of our largest customers could harm our business 

our net sales to our largest customer represented approximately 15 of our consolidated net sales in 2018 while we do not have any other customers that accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net sales in 2018 we have other customers that are key to the success of our business our concentration of sales to a relatively small number of larger customers makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business our success is dependent on retaining these customers which requires us to successfully manage relationships and anticipate the needs of our customers in the channels in which we sell our products our customers also may be impacted by economic conditions in the industries of those customers which could result in reduced demand for our products we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain our largest customers in addition some of our customers may shift their purchases to our competitors in the future the loss of one or more of our largest customers any material cancellation reduction or delay in purchases by these customers or our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a material disruption at any of our manufacturing facilities could cause us to be unable to meet customer demands or increase our costs 

if operations at any of our manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters earthquakes power outages fires explosions terrorism adverse weather conditions labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to fill customer orders and otherwise meet customer demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows interruptions in production in particular at our manufacturing facilities could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to fill customer orders we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced 

during the disruption of operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand with endcustomers and endusers within each of our business segments demand for pool equipment in the aquatic systems segment water filtration products in the filtration solutions segment and residential water supply infrastructure and agricultural products in the flow technologies segment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august while we attempt to mitigate the magnitude of the sales spike in the aquatic systems and flow technologies segments by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts we cannot provide any assurance that such programs will be successful in addition seasonal effects in the flow technologies segment may vary from year to year and be impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperature heavy flooding and droughts 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants including those that limit the amount of our debt which may restrict the operations of our business and our ability to incur additional debt to finance acquisitions our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital or our credit ratings may be downgraded in the future which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2018  we had 788 million  of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate if our cash requirements are more than we expect or if we intend to finance acquisitions we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected unfavorable changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase the costs we incur to borrow funds if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade our access to the debt capital markets may become restricted additionally our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience 

increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our shares may trade the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our share price 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the us could have a material adverse effect on us 

the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may require selfdisclosure to government agencies and result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations and changes in us government sanctions could have a material adverse effect on us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are “dual use” products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls 

from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant government authorities nonetheless our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

we are exposed to potential environmental laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to us federal state local and nonus laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as defendant target or a potentially responsible party “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of cleanup and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities could exceed the amount of our current reserves 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials substantially all of which relate to our discontinued operations these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between several dozen to more than a hundred corporate defendants historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and only where appropriate settling claims before trial as of december 31 2018  there were approximately 600  claims pending against our subsidiaries substantially all of which relate to our discontinued operations we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us environmental protection agency “epa” has published findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases “ghgs” present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are according to the epa contributing to the warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climate changes based on these findings the epa has implemented regulations that require reporting of ghg emissions or 

that limit emissions of ghgs from certain mobile or stationary sources in addition the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have considered other legislation and regulatory proposals to reduce emissions of ghgs and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the development of ghg inventories ghg permitting andor regional ghg capandtrade programs it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program or other state programs may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol andor the paris accord and these and other existing international initiatives or those under consideration could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly our energy and industrial customers are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services these actions could also increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation it is uncertain what laws will be enacted and therefore we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased information technology security threats and computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services and we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties as our business increasingly interfaces with employees customers dealers and suppliers using information technology systems and networks we are subject to an increased risk to the secure operation of these systems and networks the secure operation of these information technology systems and networks is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain establishing systems and processes to address these threats may increase our costs we have experienced data breaches and although we have determined such data breaches to be immaterial and such data breaches have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows there can be no assurance of similar results in the future should future attacks succeed in the theft of assets exporting sensitive data or financial information or controlling sensitive systems or networks it could expose us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers to the theft of assets misuse of information or systems the compromising of confidential information manipulation and destruction of data defective products and production downtimes and operations disruptions the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

changes in data privacy laws and our ability to comply with them could have a material adverse effect on us 

we collect and store data that is sensitive to pentair and its employees customers dealers and suppliers a variety of state national foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection use retention protection security disclosure transfer and other processing of personal and other data many foreign data privacy regulations including the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in the european union in 2018 are more stringent than those in the united states these laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and changing and could have an adverse effect on our operations companies’ obligations and requirements under these laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty in how they may be interpreted by government authorities the costs of compliance with and the other burdens imposed by these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs andor result in interruptions or delays in the availability of systems in the case of noncompliance these laws including the gdpr regulators have the authority to levy significant fines in addition if there is a breach of privacy we may be required to make notifications under data privacy regulations the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation and other claims 

we are currently and may in the future become subject to litigation and other claims these legal proceedings are typically claims that relate to the conduct of our business and include without limitation claims relating to commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property matters environmental safety and health matters product liability the use or installation of our products consumer matters and employment and labor matters the outcome of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and some may be disposed of unfavorably to us we also may not have insurance that covers such claims while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms and this insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims further some of our business involves the sale of our products to customers that are constructing large and complex systems facilities or other capital projects and while we generally try to limit our exposure liquidated damages 

consequential damages and other damages in the contracts for these projects we could be exposed to significant monetary damages and other liabilities in connection with the sale of our products for these projects for a variety of reasons successful claims or litigation against us for significant amounts could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to the separation of nvent electric plc by spinoff 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

on april 30 2018 we completed the separation of our electrical business through the spinoff nvent electric plc to our shareholders following the spinoff we are a smaller and less diversified company with a narrower business focus and as a result we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions although we believe that the spinoff of nvent electric plc will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our shareholders the spinoff may not provide the results on the scope or on the scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits in addition we have and will continue to incur onetime costs and ongoing costs in connection with or as a result of the spinoff including costs of operating as independent publiclytraded companies that the two businesses are no longer able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize if we do not realize the intended benefits or if our costs exceed our estimates we could suffer a material adverse effect on the business financial condition results of operations cash flows and trading prices 

the spinoff transaction could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders if the spinoff does not qualify as a taxfree transaction 

the spinoff was conditioned on our receipt of opinions of tax advisors and tax rulings from taxing authorities however these tax opinions will not be binding on taxing authorities accordingly taxing authorities or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in such opinions moreover such opinions were based on certain statements and representations made by us which if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect could invalidate the opinions if the spinoff and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable we could be subject to a substantial tax liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoff were taxable each holder of our ordinary shares who received shares of nvent electric plc in the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

we may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the spinoff 

in connection with the spinoff we and nvent electric plc entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement and an employee matters agreement these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the spinoff and provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations the indemnity rights we have against nvent under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us in addition our indemnity obligations to nvent may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in ireland and tax residency in the uk 

we are subject to changes in law and other factors that may not allow us to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry 

while we believe that we should be able to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate also the tax laws of the us the uk ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate these changes include the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in the us in december 2017 which made significant changes to certain us tax laws relevant to us including limitations on the deductibility of certain interest expense and employee compensation limitations on various other deductions and credits the imposition of taxes in respect of certain crossborder payments or transfers the imposition of taxes on certain earnings of nonus entities on a current basis and changes in the timing of the recognition of income or its character these items and regulations and guidance implementing the tax cuts and jobs act could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods in addition legislative action could be taken by the us the uk ireland or the european union which could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulations upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to maintain tax residency in the uk and take advantage of the tax treaties among the us the uk and ireland we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

a change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges 

under current irish legislation a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in ireland if it is centrally managed and controlled in ireland or in certain circumstances if it is incorporated in ireland under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the uk is regarded as resident in the uk for taxation purposes unless it is treated as resident in another jurisdiction pursuant to any appropriate double tax treaty with the uk other jurisdictions may also seek to assert taxing jurisdiction over pentair 

  

where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the uk and ireland article 43 of the double tax convention between ireland and the uk the “residence tiebreaker” currently provides that the company shall be treated as resident only in one of those two jurisdictions if its place of effective management is situated in that jurisdiction 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development has proposed a number of measures relating to the tax treatment of multinationals some of which are to be implemented by amending double tax treaties through a multilateral instrument the “mli” the mli has been signed and ratified by a number of countries including ireland and the uk the mli allows signatories to opt into or out of certain changes the effect for a given double tax convention depends on the options chosen by the two contracting states ireland and the uk have confirmed that they intend to change the residence tiebreaker so that a company will not cease being dual resident until there is a determination by the tax authorities of the two contracting states instead of an objective application of the place of effective management test the mli has not yet entered into force effect in order to amend the residence tiebreaker 

under ireland’s domestic tax residency rules pentair should not be irish resident until january 1 2021 provided that there is no change in ownership and no major change in the nature or conduct of the business of the company before that date in which case the residence tiebreaker should apply from the date of the change of ownership accordingly we do not expect the change to the residence tiebreaker to have effect until january 1 2021 at the earliest 

it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law including the entry into force and effect of the mli or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of our affairs we could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the uk if pentair ceases to be resident in the uk and becomes resident in another jurisdiction it may be subject to uk exit charges and could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction including dividend withholding taxes or corporate income tax charges if pentair were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction it could be subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions if for example pentair were considered to be a tax resident of ireland we could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by it could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of our ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company “dtc” will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold your ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 percent of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases we may in our absolute discretion pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay any stamp duty our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii will have a lien against the shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in our shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us 

our ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax “cat” could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €320000  per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents for periods on or after october 10 2018

 item 2 properties 

our principal office is located in leased premises in london uk and our management office in the us is located in leased premises in minneapolis minnesota 

our operations are conducted in facilities throughout the world these facilities house manufacturing and distribution operations as well as sales and marketing engineering and administrative offices the following is a summary of our principal properties including manufacturing distribution sales offices and service centers 



we believe that our production facilities as well as the related machinery and equipment are well maintained and suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses   




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we have been and in the future may be made parties to a number of actions filed or have been and in the future may be given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those relating to commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property matters environmental safety and health matters product liability the use or installation of our products consumer matters and employment and labor matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a 

future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other unaffiliated companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between several dozen to more than a hundred corporate defendants our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2018  there were approximately 600  claims outstanding against our subsidiaries this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

environmental matters 

we have been named as defendant target or a prp in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known as of december 31 2018 our recorded reserves for environmental matters were not material we do not anticipate our remaining environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims

overview 

pentair plc and its consolidated subsidiaries “we” “us” “our” “pentair” or the “company” is a pure play water industrial manufacturing company comprised of three reporting segments aquatic systems filtration solutions and flow technologies we classify our operations into business segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served for the year ended december 31 2018  the aquatic systems filtration solutions and flow technologies segments represented approximately 35  34  and 31  of total revenues respectively 

although our jurisdiction of organization is ireland we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom the “uk” and therefore have our tax residency in the uk

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities or completed debt and equity offerings as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions we generally issue commercial paper to fund our financing needs on a shortterm basis and use our revolving credit facility as backup liquidity to support commercial paper 

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade credit ratings and a solid liquidity position 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was 4581 million  in 2018  compared to 2786 million  in 2017  and 3799 million  in 2016  

the 4581 million  in net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2018  primarily reflects net income from continuing operations of 4234 million  net of noncash depreciation and amortization and the loss on early extinguishment of debt further increased by a positive impact of 302 million  as a result of changes in net working capital 

the 2786 million  in net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2017  primarily reflects net income from continuing operations of 3027 million  net of noncash depreciation and amortization and the loss on early extinguishment of debt partially offset by a negative impact of 873 million  as a result of changes in net working capital 

the 3799 million  in net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in 2016  primarily reflects net income from continuing operations of 2666 million  net of noncash depreciation and amortization and a positive impact of 1924 million  as a result of changes in net working capital 

investing activities 

cash used for  investing activities of continuing operations was 617 million  in 2018  compared to 26781 million  of cash provided by  investing activities of continuing operation in 2017  and 546 million  of cash used for  investing activities of continuing operations in 2016

net cash provided by  investing activities of continuing operations in 2017  primarily reflects the sale of the valves  controls business partially offset by capital expenditures of 391 million  and cash paid of 459 million  to acquire a business as part of filtration solutions 

net cash used for  investing activities of continuing operations in 2016  primarily reflects capital expenditures of 433 million  and cash paid of 250 million  to acquire a business as part of aquatic systems 

financing activities 

cash used for  financing activities was 4079 million  in 2018  compared to 34326 million  and 6001 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively 

as described below in 2018  we utilized 9936 million  of cash distributed from the separation to repay commercial paper and revolving longterm debt and for the early extinguishment of certain series of fixed rate debt additionally we repurchased 5000 million  of shares and made dividend payments of 1872 million  during 2018  

in 2017  net cash used for  financing activities primarily relates to the utilization of proceeds from the sale of the valves  controls business to repay our commercial paper and revolving longterm debt and for the early extinguishment of certain series of fixed rate debt additionally we repurchased 2000 million  of shares and made dividend payments of 2517 million  during 2017  

in 2016 net cash used for  financing activities was primarily due to net repayments of commercial paper and revolving longterm debt and payments of dividends of 2436 million  

on april 25 2018 pentair pentair investments switzerland gmbh “pisg” pentair finance sà rl “pfsa” and pentair inc entered into a credit agreement providing for a five year 8000 million  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “senior credit facility” with pentair and pisg as guarantors and pfsa and pentair inc as borrowers the senior credit facility replaced pfsa’s existing credit facility under that certain amended and restated credit agreement dated as of october 3 2014 pfsa has the option to request to increase the senior credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to 3000 million  subject to customary conditions including the commitment of the participating lenders the senior credit facility has a maturity date of april 25 2023 borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to an adjusted base rate or the london interbank offered rate plus in each case an applicable margin the applicable margin is based on at pfsa’s election pentair’s leverage level or pfsa’s public credit rating 

pfsa is authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the senior credit facility pfsa uses the senior credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding pfsa had 760 million  of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2018  and 340 million  as of december 31 2017  all of which was classified as longterm debt as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the senior credit facility 

our debt agreements contain various financial covenants but the most restrictive covenants are contained in the senior credit facility the senior credit facility contains covenants requiring us not to permit i the ratio of our consolidated debt net of its consolidated unrestricted cash in excess of 50 million  but not to exceed 2500 million  to our consolidated net income excluding among other things noncash gains and losses before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash sharebased compensation expense “ebitda” on the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to exceed 375  to 100  the “leverage ratio” and ii the ratio of our ebitda to our consolidated interest expense for the same period to be less than 300  to 100  as of the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of the leverage ratio the senior credit facility provides for the calculation of ebitda giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements 

total availability under the senior credit facility was 6978 million  as of december 31 2018  

in addition to the senior credit facility we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of 211 million  of which there were no  outstanding borrowings at december 31 2018  borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 

in june 2018 we used the 9936 million  of cash received from nvent as a result of the distribution to pay down commercial paper and revolving credit facilities redeem the remaining 2553 million  aggregate principal of our 29  fixed rate senior notes due 2018 and complete a cash tender offer in the amount of €3634 million  aggregate principal of our 245  senior notes due 2019 all costs associated with the repurchases of debt were recorded as a loss on early extinguishment of debt  in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income   including 160 million  premium paid on early extinguishment and 11 million  of unamortized deferred financing costs 

as of december 31 2018  we had 488 million  of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

authorized shares 

our authorized share capital consists of 4260 million  ordinary shares with a par value of 001  per share 

share repurchases 

in december 2014 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of 10 billion  the “2014 authorization” on may 8 2018 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary 

shares up to a maximum dollar limit of 7500 million  the “2018 authorization” replacing the 2014 authorization the 2018

during the year ended december 31 2018  we repurchased 102 million  of our shares for 5000 million  of which 22 million  shares or 1500 million  and 80 million  shares or 3500 million  were repurchased pursuant to the 2014 and 2018 authorizations respectively 

as of december 31 2018  we had 4000 million  available for share repurchases under the 2018 authorization 

dividends 

on december 10 2018 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 018  that was paid on february 8 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 25 2019 additionally the board of directors approved a plan to increase the 2019 annual cash dividend to 072  from 070  adjusted for the separation the 2019 dividend is intended to be paid in four quarterly installments as a result the balance of dividends payable included in other current liabilities  on our consolidated balance sheets was 308 million  at december 31 2018  dividends paid per ordinary share were 105  138  and 134  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

under irish law the payment of future cash dividends and repurchases of shares may be paid only out of pentair plc’s “distributable reserves” on its statutory balance sheet pentair plc is not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital which includes share premiums distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the irish parent company and through a reduction in share capital approved by the irish high court distributable reserves are not linked to a gaap reported amount eg retained earnings our distributable reserve balance was 65 billion  and 90 billion  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 



the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business for purposes of the above table arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2018  variable interest rate debt was 1022 million  at a weighted average interest rate of 336  

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2018  was estimated to be 514 million  we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes  and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2018  we had recorded 05 million  for the possible payment of penalties and 36 million  related to the possible payment of interest 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of adjusted net income free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2018  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

commitments and contingencies 

we have been and in the future may be made parties to a number of actions filed or have been and in the future may be given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those relating to commercial or contractual disputes with suppliers customers or parties to acquisitions and divestitures intellectual property matters environmental safety and health matters product liability the use or installation of our products consumer matters and employment and labor matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

standby letters of credit bank guarantees and bonds 

in certain situations tyco international ltd pentair ltd’s former parent company “tyco” guaranteed performance by the flow control business of pentair ltd “flow control” to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of flow control in situations where flow control and tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spinoff of flow control from tyco we will indemnify tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate the potential liability due to the inchoate and unknown nature of these potential liabilities however we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the outstanding value of bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 1236 million  and 1292 million  respectively 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we complete our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter we last performed a twostep assessment of goodwill impairment as of october 1 2017 referred to as a “step 1” approach in the first step of the step 1 approach the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step of the step 1 approach an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and longterm business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a six year longterm planning period the six year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated 

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each reporting unit that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of ebitda we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

as of october 1 2018 we performed a qualitative assessment referred to as a “step 0” approach and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts as a result the company is not required to proceed to a “step 1” impairment assessment factors considered included the 2017 “step 1” analysis and the calculated excess fair value over carrying amount financial performance forecasts and trends market capitalization regulatory and environmental issues macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations raw material and labor costs and management stability we consider the extent to which each of the adverse events and circumstances identified affect the comparison of the respective reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying amount we place more weight on the events and circumstances that most affect the respective reporting unit’s fair value or the carrying amount of its net assets we consider positive and mitigating events and circumstances that may affect its determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds the carrying amount 

we completed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2018 2017 and 2016 with no indications of impairment 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names proprietary technology and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization 

the impairment test for trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the nonrecurring fair value measurement is a “level 3” measurement under the fair value hierarchy 

there were no  impairment charges recorded in 2018 for identifiable intangible assets 

an impairment charge of 88 million  was recorded in 2017 related to certain trade names in filtration solutions and flow technologies as a result of lower forecasted sales volume or rebranding strategies implemented in the fourth quarter of 2017 the trade name impairment charges were recorded in selling general and administrative in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 

there were no  impairment charges recorded in 2016 for identifiable intangible assets 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor us and nonus definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other postretirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year “marktomarket adjustment” and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other postretirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments marktomarket adjustments resulted in pretax charges of 36 million  and 85 million  in 2018  and 2017  respectively and pretax income of 120 million  in 2016  the remaining components of pension expense including service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds rated aa or higher available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumptions that will impact our pension expense in 2019  

expected rate of return 

the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longterm market indices 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2018  was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 88  fixedrate debt and 12  variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2018  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an 116 million  decrease or a 120 million  increase in fair value respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2018  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 10 million  increase or decrease in interest incurred 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are generally the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk at december 31 2018  and 2017  we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with gross notional us dollar equivalent amounts of 3314 million  and 4814 million  respectively changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income when the hedged item affects earnings 

at december 31 2018 we had €1366 million 245 senior notes due 2019 the “2019 euro notes” designated as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency the hedge is intended to reduce but will not eliminate the impact on our financial results of changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar the currency risk related to the net investment hedge is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market exchange rates in effect on december 31 2018  a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 141  million net increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss  conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 172  million net decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss  however 

these increases and decreases in other comprehensive income would be offset by decreases or increases in the hedged net investments on our balance sheet due to currency translation

history and development 

in december 2013 the companys board of directors approved changing the companys jurisdiction of organization from switzerland to ireland at an extraordinary meeting of shareholders on may 20 2014 pentair ltd shareholders voted in favor of a reorganization proposal pursuant to which pentair ltd would merge into pentair plc and all pentair ltd common shares would be cancelled and all holders of such shares would receive ordinary shares of pentair plc on a onetoone basis the reorganization transaction was completed on june 3 2014 at which time pentair plc replaced pentair ltd as the ultimate parent company the redomicile shares of pentair plc began trading on the new york stock exchange nyse on june 3 2014 under the symbol pnr the same symbol under which pentair ltd shares were previously traded 

although our jurisdiction of organization is ireland we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom the uk and therefore have our tax residency in the uk 

our former parent company pentair ltd took its form on september 28 2012 as a result of a reverse acquisition the merger involving pentair inc and an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of flow control defined below with pentair inc surviving as an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of ours flow control refers to pentair ltd prior to the merger prior to the merger tyco international ltd tyco engaged in an internal restructuring whereby it transferred to flow control certain assets related to the flow control business of tyco and flow control assumed from tyco certain liabilities related to the flow control business of tyco on september 28 2012 prior to the merger tyco effected a spinoff of flow control through the prorata distribution of 100  of the outstanding ordinary shares of flow control to tycos shareholders the distribution resulting in the distribution of approximately 1109 million  of our ordinary shares to tycos shareholders the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting with pentair inc treated as the acquirer 

on september 18 2015 we acquired as part of electrical all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of erico global company erico for approximately 18 billion  in cash the erico acquisition erico is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of engineered electrical and fastening products for electrical mechanical and civil applications erico has employees in 30 countries across the world with recognized brands including caddy fixing fastening and support products erico electrical grounding bonding and connectivity products and lenton engineered systems

on may 9 2017 we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to separate our water business and electrical business into two independent publiclytraded companies the proposed separation the proposed separation is expected to occur through a taxfree spinoff of the electrical business to pentair shareholders 

completion of the proposed separation is subject to certain customary conditions including among other things final approval of the transaction by pentairs board of directors receipt of tax opinions and rulings and effectiveness of appropriate filings with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec upon completion of the proposed separation it is anticipated that electricals jurisdiction of organization will be ireland but that it will manage its affairs so that it will be centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom the uk and therefore will have its tax residency in the uk 

we are targeting april 30 2018 for the completion of the proposed separation however there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed separation or that the proposed separation will be completed

water 

the water segment designs manufactures markets and services innovative water solutions for the filtration separation flow and water management challenges in agriculture foodservice food and beverage processing swimming pools water supply and disposal and a variety of industrial applications 

water provides a comprehensive portfolio of products and services to address customers’ needs for reliable and efficient movement and control of water and other fluids this includes a full range of water treatment equipment including energyefficient pumps pointofentrypointofuse filtration valves uv sanitization and automation controls for residential and commercial applications as well as engineered solutions in advanced filtration desalination water supply and disposal process and control for industrial and infrastructure applications we offer design and consulting services and our advanced water technologies are used across a wide number of industries including residential commercial foodservice industrial aquaculture irrigation and flood control wastewater and more our equipment and solutions are found in swimming pools and spas water purification and sanitation systems foodservice operations food and beverage processing plants wastewater treatment plants flood control and storm water management facilities and in other applications across the globe 

brand names for water include aurora berkeley codeline everpure fairbanksnijhuis kreepy krauly haffmans hydromatic hypro pentair pentair aquatic ecosystems starite shurflo südmo and xflow 

customers 

water customers include businesses engaged in wholesale and retail distribution in the residential  commercial food  beverage infrastructure and industrial verticals customers also include enduser and consumers in the residential  commercial vertical as well as engineering procurement contractors and original equipment manufacturers 

seasonality 

we experience increased demand for residential water supply and pool equipment products infrastructure and agricultural products following warm weather trends which are at season highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase is mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor 

additional discounts seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperatures heavy flooding and droughts 

competition 

water faces numerous domestic and international competitors some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the verticals in which we compete competition focuses on brand names product performance including energyefficient offerings and required specifications quality service and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also provide us a competitive advantage 

electrical 

the electrical segment designs manufactures markets installs and services high performance products and solutions that connect and protect some of the worlds most sensitive equipment buildings and critical processes 

electrical products include mild steel stainless steel aluminum and nonmetallic enclosures cabinets cases subracks backplanes engineered fastening solutions across a wide range of industries and verticals and thermal management systems including heat tracing floor heating firerated and specialty wiring sensing and snow melting and deicing solutions for industrial commercial and residential use

seasonality 

electrical generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere and increased demand for electrical fastening products during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere 

competition 

within electrical the equipment protection business faces significant competition in the verticals it serves particularly within the communications industry where product design prototyping global supply price competition and customer service are significant factors the industries and verticals served by the thermal management business are highly fragmented comprising local markets and niches the industries and verticals served by the engineered fastening solutions business is relatively fragmented with a small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller suppliers we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and compatible products which are competitively priced 

information regarding all reportable segments 

backlog of orders by segment 



a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and products delivered in the same month our backlog typically has a short manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order however a portion of our backlog particularly from orders for major capital projects can take more than one year depending on the size and type of order we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract we expect the majority of our backlog at december 31 2017  will be shipped in 2018  

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities these efforts consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2017  2016  and 2015  were 1158 million  1141 million  and 987 million  respectively 

raw materials 

the principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies copper and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

we purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future 

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trademark trade name or brand name

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document 

risks relating to our proposed separation of our water business and electrical business by spinoff 

the proposed separation of our water business and electrical business is contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions may require significant time and attention of our management and may have an adverse effect on us whether or not it is completed 

on may 9 2017 we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to separate our water business and electrical business into two independent publiclytraded companies through a spinoff completion of the spinoff will be contingent upon customary conditions including obtaining final approval from our board of directors receipt of tax opinions and rulings and effectiveness of appropriate filings with the sec in addition the proposed spinoff is complex in nature and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions for these and other reasons the spinoff may not be completed on april 30 2018 as we are targeting if at all 

whether or not we complete the spinoff our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and we may be subject to certain risks and consequences as a result of pursuing the spinoff including the following 

 any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and trading prices 

we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the spinoff 

although we believe that separating our electrical business from our water business by means of the spinoff will provide financial operational managerial and other benefits to us and our shareholders the spinoff may not provide the results on the scope or on the scale we anticipate and we may not realize any or all of the intended benefits in addition we will incur onetime costs and ongoing costs in connection with or as a result of the spinoff including costs of operating as independent publiclytraded companies that the two businesses will no longer be able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could negate some of the benefits we expect to realize if we do not realize the intended benefits or if our costs exceed our estimates we could suffer a material adverse effect on the business financial condition results of operations cash flows and trading prices 

if the proposed spinoff of our electrical business is completed the trading price of our ordinary shares will likely decline and may experience greater volatility 

we expect the trading price of our ordinary shares immediately following the spinoff to be significantly lower than immediately prior to the spinoff because the trading price for our shares will no longer reflect the value of our electrical business in addition until the market has fully analyzed our value without our electrical business the price of our shares may experience greater volatility 

if the proposed spinoff is completed our shares may not match some holders investment strategies or meet minimum criteria for inclusion in stock market indices or portfolios which could cause investors to sell their shares excessive selling pressure could cause the market price of our shares to decrease further following the completion of the proposed spinoff 

following the spinoff the value of our ordinary shares and the ordinary shares of the electrical business that is spun off may collectively trade at an aggregate price less than that at which the companys ordinary shares might trade had the spinoff not occurred 

for a number of reasons our ordinary shares and the ordinary shares of the electrical business that is spun off that you may hold following the spinoff may collectively trade at a value less than the price at which our ordinary shares might have traded had the spinoff not occurred and we continued to own the electrical business these reasons include the future performance of either us or the electrical business as separate independent companies and the future shareholder base and market for our ordinary shares and the ordinary shares of the electrical business and the prices at which these shares individually trade 

the proposed spinoff transaction could result in substantial tax liability to us and our shareholders 

the spinoff is conditioned on our receipt of opinions of tax counsel and tax rulings from taxing authorities however these tax opinions will not be binding on taxing authorities accordingly taxing authorities or the courts may reach conclusions with respect to the spinoff that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinions of counsel moreover the opinions of counsel will be based on certain statements and representations made by us which if incomplete or inaccurate in any material respect could invalidate the opinion of counsel additionally certain internal restructuring transactions necessary to accomplish the spinoff may result in adverse tax consequences to us 

if the spinoff and certain related transactions were determined to be taxable we could be subject to a substantial tax liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the spinoff were taxable each holder of our ordinary shares who receives shares of the electrical business in the spinoff would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received 

risks relating to our business 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial markets and residential markets we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and results of operations due to economic and business cycles important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the economy and our customers confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates and energy and commodity prices the businesses of many of our industrial customers are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of the above factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could reduce demand for our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers we compete based on technical expertise reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms and price some of our competitors in particular smaller companies attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and solutions or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2017  accounted for 40  of our net sales our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principal nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenue in future periods in addition currency variations could have a material adverse effect on margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the us and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the us 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire competitive products and services and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively the failure to effectively adapt our products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not be able to identify finance and complete suitable acquisitions and investments and any completed acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources 

our business strategy includes acquiring businesses and making investments that complement our existing businesses we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and service offerings we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain financing or have sufficient cash necessary for acquisitions or successfully complete acquisitions in the future or that completed acquisitions will be successful acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions or investments may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our business initiatives 

during 2017  2016  and 2015  we initiated and continued execution of certain business initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business as a result we have incurred substantial expense including restructuring charges we may not be able to achieve the operating efficiencies to reduce costs or realize benefits that were anticipated in connection with these initiatives if we are unable to execute these initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows  

we are exposed to political regulatory economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2017  accounted for 40  of our net sales further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from nonus suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 



 our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

we may experience cost and other inflation 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs however these actions may not be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we test goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets as of december 31 2017  our goodwill and intangible assets were 59095 million  and represented 68  of our total assets longterm declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges 

a material disruption at any of our manufacturing facilities could cause us to be unable to meet customer demands or increase our costs 

if operations at any of our manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters earthquakes power outages fires explosions terrorism adverse weather conditions labor disputes or other reasons we may be unable to fill customer orders and otherwise meet customer demand for our products which could have a material adverse effect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows interruptions in production in particular at our manufacturing facilities could increase our costs and reduce our sales any interruption in production capability could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to fill customer orders we maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could have a material adverse effect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within both of our business segments in water demand for residential water supply products infrastructure agricultural products and enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follow warm weather trends and are at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase in water is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or early buy programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperatures heavy flooding and droughts electrical generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere and increased demand for electrical fastening products during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere seasonality and weather conditions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our shares may trade the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our share price 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the us could have a material adverse effect on us 

the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may require selfdisclosure to government agencies and result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations and changes in us government sanctions could have a material adverse effect on us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are dual use products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant government authorities nonetheless our policies and procedures may not always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

changes in us administrative policy including changes to existing trade agreements could have a material adverse effect on us 

as a result of changes to us administrative policy there may be changes to existing trade agreements like the north american free trade agreement greater restrictions on free trade generally significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the us particularly tariffs on products manufactured in mexico among other possible changes changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products and any resulting negative sentiments towards the us as a result of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to potential environmental laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to us federal state local and nonus laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as defendant target or a potentially responsible party prp in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of cleanup and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities could exceed the amount of our current reserves 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims we have experienced an increase in the number of asbestosrelated lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs 

with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed or withdrawn our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and only where appropriate settling claims before trial as of december 31 2017  there were approximately 600  claims pending against our subsidiaries we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us environmental protection agency epa has published findings that emissions of carbon dioxide methane and other greenhouse gases ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are according to the epa contributing to the warming of the earths atmosphere and other climate changes based on these findings the epa has implemented regulations that require reporting of ghg emissions or that limit emissions of ghgs from certain mobile or stationary sources in addition the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have considered other legislation and regulatory proposals to reduce emissions of ghgs and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs primarily through the development of ghg inventories ghg permitting andor regional ghg capandtrade programs it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program or other state programs may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol andor the paris accord and these and other existing international initiatives or those under consideration could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly our energy and industrial customers  are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services these actions could also increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased information technology security threats and computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services and we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to pentair and its employees customers dealers and suppliers as our business increasingly interfaces with employees customers dealers and suppliers using information technology systems and networks we are subject to an increased risk to the secure operation of these systems and networks and to additional laws and regulatory requirements regarding data privacy including the european union general data protection regulation the secure operation of these information technology systems and networks and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs we have experienced data breaches and although we have determined such data breaches to be immaterial and such data breaches have not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows there can be no assurance of similar results in the future should future attacks succeed in the theft of assets exporting sensitive data or financial information or controlling sensitive systems or networks it could expose us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers to the theft of assets misuse of information or systems the compromising of confidential information manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions and breach of privacy which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

we may be negatively impacted by litigation including product liability claims 

our businesses expose us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms and this insurance may not provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims successful claims against us for significant amounts could have a material adverse effect on our product reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we share responsibility for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the distribution 

in connection with the distribution we entered into a tax sharing agreement the 2012 tax sharing agreement with tyco now known as johnson controls international plc johnson controls and the adt corporation adt which governs the rights and obligations of adt johnson controls and us for certain predistribution tax liabilities including johnson controls obligations under a separate tax sharing agreement the 2007 tax sharing agreement entered into by johnson controls covidien ltd now known as medtronic plc medtronic and te connectivity ltd te connectivity in connection with the 2007 distributions of medtronic and te connectivity by johnson controls 

the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that we johnson controls and adt will share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our johnson controls and adts us income tax returns including withholding tax income tax or other tax liabilities that could arise if the merger distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are determined to be taxable for us federal or swiss tax purposes and ii payments required to be made by johnson controls with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement the liabilities in clauses i and ii collectively shared tax liabilities johnson controls is responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities as of december 31 2017 johnson controls has paid 2100 million of shared tax liabilities we and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities we adt and johnson controls will share 20 275 and 525 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million costs and expenses associated with the management of shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20 by us 275 by adt and 525 by johnson controls the ultimate resolution of these matters and the impact of that resolution are uncertain to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the 2012 tax sharing agreement and indirectly the 2007 tax sharing agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

in addition under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution the adt distribution the internal transactions or the merger were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or johnson controls the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or johnson controls then we adt and johnson controls would be responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of such determination in the same manner and in the same proportions as we adt and johnson controls are responsible for shared tax liabilities such tax amounts could be significant 

risks relating to our liquidity 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants including those that limit the amount of our debt which may restrict the operations of our business and our ability to incur additional debt to finance acquisitions our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all 

amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2017  we had 14 billion  of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate if our cash requirements are more than we expect or if we intend to finance acquisitions we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in ireland and tax residency in the uk 

we are subject to changes in law and other factors that may not allow us to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry 

while we believe that we should be able to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate also the tax laws of the us the uk ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate in particular legislative action could be taken by the us the uk ireland or the european union which could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulations upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to maintain tax residency in the uk and take advantage of the tax treaties among the us the uk and ireland we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

a change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and may trigger taxes on dividends or exit charges 

under current irish legislation a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in ireland if it is centrally managed and controlled in ireland or in certain circumstances if it is incorporated in ireland under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the uk is regarded as resident in the uk for taxation purposes unless it is treated as resident in another jurisdiction pursuant to any appropriate double tax treaty with the uk other jurisdictions may also seek to assert taxing jurisdiction over pentair 

  

where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the uk and ireland article 43 of the double tax convention between ireland and the uk the residence tiebreaker currently provides that the company shall be treated as resident only in one of those two jurisdictions if its place of effective management is situated in that jurisdiction 

the organisation for economic cooperation and development has proposed a number of measures relating to the tax treatment of multinationals some of which are to be implemented by amending double tax treaties through a multilateral instrument the mli the mli has been signed by a number of countries including ireland and the uk the mli allows signatories to opt into or out of certain changes the effect for a given double tax convention depends on the options chosen by 

the two contracting states ireland and the uk have indicated they intend to change the residence tiebreaker so that it will depend on a ruling by the tax authorities of the two contracting states instead of an objective application of the place of effective management test accordingly if ireland and the uk maintain their position and enough other countries ratify the mli the residence tiebreaker would be amended to depend on a determination by irish revenue commissioners and the uk hm revenue and customs it is not certain when this will take place nor what factors will be taken into account in making the determination but we do not expect such a determination to alter our tax residency 

it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law including the entry into force of the mli or a change to the intention of ireland or the uk in relation to the mli or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of our affairs we could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the uk if pentair ceases to be resident in the uk and becomes resident in another jurisdiction it may be subject to uk exit charges and could become liable for additional tax charges in the other jurisdiction including dividend withholding taxes or corporate income tax charges if pentair were to be treated as resident in more than one jurisdiction it could be subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions if for example pentair were considered to be a tax resident of ireland we could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by it could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the us currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of our ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold your ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 percent of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases we may in our absolute discretion pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay any stamp duty our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii will have a lien against the shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in our shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us 

our ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €310000 per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents for periods on or after october 12 2016

 item 2 properties 

our principal office is located in leased premises in london united kingdom and our management office in the united states is located in leased premises in minneapolis minnesota our operations are conducted in facilities throughout the world these facilities house manufacturing and distribution operations as well as sales and marketing engineering and administrative offices 

we carry out our water manufacturing operations at 21  plants located throughout the united states and at 27  plants located in 14  other countries in addition water has 33  distribution facilities 48  sales offices and 11  service centers located in numerous countries throughout the world 

we carry out our electrical manufacturing operations at 8  plants located throughout the united states and at 13  plants located in 11  other countries in addition electrical has 24  distribution facilities 53  sales offices and 2  service centers located in numerous countries throughout the world 

we believe that our production facilities are suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses   




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other unaffiliated companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2017 there were approximately 600  claims outstanding against our subsidiaries this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

environmental matters 

we have been named as defendant target or a potentially responsible party prp in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known as of december 31 2017 our recorded reserves for environmental matters were not material we do not anticipate our remaining environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims

future dividends on our ordinary shares or reductions of share capital for distribution to shareholders if any must be approved by our board of directors for payment out of distributable reserves on our statutory balance sheet we are not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital which includes share premiums distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the irish parent company and through a reduction in share capital approved by the irish high court distributable reserves are not linked to a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap reported amount eg retained earnings on july 22 2014 the irish high court approved pentair plcs conversion of approximately 144 billion of share premium to distributable reserves on july 29 2014 following the approval of the irish high court we made the required filing of pentair plcs initial accounts with the irish companies registration office which completed the process to allow us to pay future cash dividends and redeem and repurchase shares out of pentair plcs distributable reserves our distributable reserve balance was 90 billion  and 94 billion  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively 

the timing declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary shares will depend upon many factors including our financial condition and results of operations the capital requirements of our businesses industry practice and any other relevant factors 

united kingdom tax considerations 

although our jurisdiction of organization is ireland we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the uk and therefore have our tax residency in the uk 

as a result of its uk tax status dividend distributions by pentair plc to its shareholders are not subject to withholding tax as the uk currently does not levy a withholding tax on dividend distributions

overview 

pentair plc is a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprising two reporting segments water and electrical we classify our operations into business segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served for the year ended december 31 2017  water and electrical accounted for 58  and 42  of total revenues respectively 

although our jurisdiction of organization is ireland we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom the uk and therefore have our tax residency in the uk 

on september 18 2015 we acquired as part of electrical all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of erico global company erico for approximately 18 billion  in cash the erico acquisition erico is a leading global manufacturer and marketer of engineered electrical and fastening products for electrical mechanical and civil applications erico has employees in 30 countries across the world with recognized brands including caddy fixing fastening and support products erico electrical grounding bonding and connectivity products and lenton engineered systems 

on april 28 2017 we completed the sale of the valves  controls business to emerson electric co for 315 billion  in cash the sale resulted in a gain of 1811 million  net of tax the results of the valves  controls business have been presented as discontinued operations and the related assets and liabilities have been reclassified as held for sale for all periods presented the valves  controls business was previously disclosed as a standalone reporting segment 

on may 9 2017 we announced that our board of directors approved a plan to separate our water business and electrical business into two independent publiclytraded companies the proposed separation the proposed separation is expected to occur through a taxfree spinoff of the electrical business to pentair shareholders 

completion of the proposed separation is subject to certain customary conditions including among other things final approval of the transaction by pentairs board of directors receipt of tax opinions and rulings and effectiveness of appropriate filings with the sec upon completion of the proposed separation it is anticipated that electricals jurisdiction of organization will be ireland but that it will manage its affairs so that it will be centrally managed and controlled in the uk and therefore will have its tax residency in the uk 

we are targeting april 30 2018 for the completion of the proposed separation however there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the proposed separation or that the proposed separation will be completed

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities or completed debt and equity offerings as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions we generally issue commercial paper to fund our financing needs on a shortterm basis and use our revolving credit facility as backup liquidity to support commercial paper 

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade credit ratings and a solid liquidity position 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within both our water and electrical segments we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale early buy programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts additionally electrical generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere and increased demand for electrical fastening products during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was 6740 million  in 2017  it was primarily related to net income from continuing operations  net of the following noncash items depreciations and amortization loss on sale of businesses trade name and other impairment loss on early extinguishment of debt and pension and other postretirement expense 

cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was 7024 million  in 2016  or 1047 million   higher  than in 2015  the increase  in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was due primarily to a 1226 million   increase  in net income from continuing operations  net of the following noncash items depreciations and amortization loss on sale of businesses trade name impairment and pension and other postretirement expense 

investing activities 

net cash provided by  investing activities of continuing operations was 26369 million  in 2017  compared to net cash used for investing activities of 1233 million  and 20036 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the following investing activities impacted our cash flow 

sale of businesses 

on april 28 2017 we completed the sale of the valves  controls business to emerson electric co for 315 billion  in cash 

acquisitions 

during 2017  we completed acquisitions with purchase prices totaling 595 million  in cash net of cash acquired 

in november 2016 we paid cash of 250 million  to acquire a business as part of water 

in 2015 we paid cash of 18063 million net of cash acquired to acquire erico global company during the third quarter and cash of 960 million net of cash acquired to acquire nuheat industries limited nuheat during the second quarter both as part of electrical during the fourth quarter we paid an additional 09 million related to the nuheat acquisition in settlement of a working capital adjustment 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures in 2017  2016  and 2015  were 709 million  1178 million  and 913 million  respectively we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2018  to be approximately 850 million primarily for capacity expansions of manufacturing facilities located in our lowcost countries developing new products and general maintenance 

financing activities 

net cash used for  financing activities was 34326 million  in 2017  as described further below we utilized a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the valves  controls business to repay our commercial paper and revolving long term debt and for the early extinguishment of certain series of fixed rate debt additionally we repurchased 2000 million  of shares during 2017 and paid 2517 million  of dividends 

net cash used for  financing activities was 6001 million  in 2016  cash used for financing activities in 2016  was primarily due to net repayments of commercial paper and revolving longterm debt and payments of dividends 

net cash provided by  financing activities was 12863 million  in 2015  cash provided by financing activities in 2016 was primarily due to cash proceeds received from the september 2015 issuance of senior notes discussed below partially offset by share repurchases repayment of 350 million of senior notes due 2015 and payment of dividends 

in october 2014 pentair plc pentair investments switzerland gmbh pisg pentair finance sà rl pfsa and pentair inc entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility with pentair plc and pisg as guarantors and pfsa and pentair inc as borrowers the credit facility had a maximum aggregate availability of 21000 million  and a maturity date of october 3 2019 borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to the london interbank offered rate libor plus a specified margin based upon pfsas credit ratings pfsa must pay a facility fee ranging from 90  to 250  basis points per annum based upon pfsas credit ratings on the amount of each lenders commitment and letter of credit fee for each letter of credit issued and outstanding under the credit facility

in may 2017 we repurchased aggregate principal of certain series of outstanding notes totaling 16593 million  all costs associated with the repurchases were recorded as loss on early extinguishment of debt  including 65 million  of unamortized deferred financing costs 

pfsa is authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility pfsa uses the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had 340 million  and 3987 million  respectively of commercial paper outstanding all of which was classified as longterm as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility 

our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants the most restrictive of which are in the credit facility as updated for the amendments including that we may not permit i the ratio of our consolidated debt plus synthetic lease obligations to our consolidated net income excluding among other things noncash gains and losses before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash sharebased compensation expense and up to a lifetime maximum 250 million  of costs fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain acquisitions investments dispositions and the issuance repayment or refinancing of debt ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended the leverage ratio to exceed 350  to 100  as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters and ii the ratio of our ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters 

then ended to our consolidated interest expense including consolidated yield or discount accrued as to outstanding securitization obligations if any for the same period to be less than 300  to 100  as of the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of the leverage ratio the credit facility provides for the calculation of ebitda giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements 

total availability under the credit facility was 24376 million  as of december 31 2017  which was limited to 18975 million  by the leverage ratio in the credit facilitys credit agreement 

in addition to the credit facility we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of 300 million  of which there were no  outstanding borrowings at december 31 2017  borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates 

as of december 31 2017  we had 651 million  of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

dividends 

on december 5 2017 the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 035  that was paid on february 9 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on january 26 2018 additionally the board of directors approved a plan to increase the 2018 annual cash dividend to 140  which is intended to paid in four quarterly installments the 2018 increase will mark the 42 nd  consecutive year we have increased dividends 

we paid dividends in 2017  of 2517 million  or 138  per ordinary share compared with 2436 million  or 134  per ordinary share in 2016  and 2317 million  or 128  per ordinary share in 2015

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 



the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business for purposes of the above table arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2017  variable interest rate debt was 624 million  at a weighted average interest rate of 267  

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2017  was estimated to be 366 million  we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes  and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2017  we had recorded 23 million  for the possible payment of penalties and 94 million  related to the possible payment of interest 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of adjusted net income free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of liquidity because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2017  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

commitments and contingencies 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

standby letters of credit bank guarantees and bonds 

in certain situations tyco guaranteed flow controls performance to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of flow control in situations where flow control and tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spinoff we will indemnify tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate the potential liability due to the inchoate and unknown nature of these potential liabilities however we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the outstanding value of bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 2015 million  and 3310 million  respectively 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 



 our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations this nonrecurring fair value measurement is a level 3 measurement under the fair value hierarchy described below 

in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and longterm business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a six year longterm planning period the six year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated revenues and operating profit beyond 2023  are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate of 30  

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we utilized discount rates ranging from 90  to 95  in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each reporting unit that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2017  2016  and 2015  with each of our reporting units fair value in excess of its carrying value 

during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2015 the oil and gas industry continued to deteriorate leading management to reconsider its estimates for future profitability of the reporting unit and thereby increasing the likelihood that the associated goodwill could be impaired as such we concluded that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 requiring that we test the goodwill of our former valves  controls business for impairment as a result we reperformed our step one analysis as of december 31 2015 consistent with our annual test the fair value was estimated using both a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach 

the results of our step one goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2015 indicated that the fair value of our former valves  controls business was below its carrying value accordingly we performed the step two test and concluded the goodwill of our former valves  controls business was impaired as a result we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 5152 million  for the year ended december 31 2015 the impairment charge was recorded in income loss from discontinued operations net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names and trademarks proprietary technology backlog and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization 

the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

an impairment charge of 252 million  was recorded in 2017 related to certain trade names in both water and electrical as a result of either lower forecasted sales volume or rebranding strategies implemented in the fourth quarter of 2017 an impairment charge of 133 million  was recorded in 2016 related to a trade name in electrical as the result of a rebranding strategy implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 the trade name impairment charges were recorded in selling general and administrative in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

as noted above during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2015 the oil and gas industry continued to deteriorate leading management to reconsider its estimates for future profitability of our former valves  controls business and thereby increasing the likelihood that the associated intangible assets could be impaired as such we concluded that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 requiring that we test valves  controls trade names for impairment as a result of this test an impairment charge of 395 million  was recorded in 2015 related to trade names in the valves  controls business that was sold in 2017 the impairment charge was recorded in income loss from discontinued operations net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor us and nonus definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other postretirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year marktomarket adjustment and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other postretirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments marktomarket adjustments resulted in pretax charges of 16 million  and 42 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively and pretax income of 230 million  in 2015  the remaining components of pension expense including service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds available in the marketplace rated aa or higher adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a weightedaverage discount rate for our us plans of 339  in 2017  402  in 2016  and 421  in 2015  the discount rates on our nonus plans ranged from 050  to 350  in 2017  050  to 400  in 2016  and 050  to 425  in 2015  there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2018  

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets for our us plans was 411  for 2017  428  in 2016  and 365  in 2015  the expected rate of return on our nonus plans ranged from 100  to 550  in 2017  100  to 550  in 2016  and 100  to 600  in 2015  the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns 

with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices 

in november 2017 our board of directors approved amendments to terminate the pentair salaried plan the salaried plan a us qualified pension plan the salaried plan discontinued accruing benefits on december 31 2017  and the termination was effective december 31 2017 it is expected to take 18 to 24 months from the date of the approved amendment to complete the termination of the salaried plan 

see item 8 note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension and other postretirement plans 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2017  was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 96  fixedrate debt and 4  variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2017  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 286 million  decrease or a 293 million  increase in fair value respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2017  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 06 million  increase or decrease in interest incurred 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are generally the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk at december 31 2017  and 2016  we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with gross notional us dollar equivalent amounts of 4814 million  and 4756 million  respectively changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of aoci and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when the hedged item affects earnings 

in september 2015 we designated the €5000 million 245 senior notes due 2019 the 2019 euro notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency the hedge is intended to reduce but will not eliminate the impact on our financial results of changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar the currency risk related to the net investment hedge is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market exchange rates in effect on december 31 2017  a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 540  million net increase in other comprehensive income conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 660  million net decrease in other comprehensive income however these increases and decreases in other comprehensive income would be offset by decreases or increases in the hedged net investments on our balance sheet due to currency translation

new segmentation 

during the first quarter of 2017 we reorganized our business segments to reflect a new operating structure resulting in a change to our reporting segments in 2017 as part of this reorganization the legacy water quality systems business segment was combined with the legacy flow  filtration solutions business segment to form the water reporting segment and now operates as a standalone business segment in addition the legacy technical solutions business segment will be renamed the electrical reporting segment all segment information presented throughout this annual report on form 10k with exception of the table below was prepared based on the reporting segments in place during 2016   

the below table presents sales and segment income under the revised reporting segments water and electrical for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 



information regarding all reportable segments 

backlog of orders by segment 



a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product delivered in the same month our backlog typically has a short manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order however a portion of our backlog particularly from orders for major capital projects can take more than one year depending on the size and type of order we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract we expect the majority of our backlog at december 31 2016  will be shipped in 2017  

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities these efforts consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2016  2015  and 2014  were 1141 million  987 million  and 964 million  respectively 

environmental 

environmental matters are discussed in item 3 item 7 and item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

we purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document 

risks relating to our business 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial markets and residential markets we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the economy and our customers confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates and energy and commodity prices the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies mining and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of the above factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could reduce demand for our products and services 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers we compete based on technical expertise reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms and price some of our competitors in particular smaller companies attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and solutions or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2016  accounted for 41 percent  of our net sales our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principle nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa during 2016 foreign currency translations had a 08 percent  negative impact on our net sales fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could continue to adversely affect our reported revenue in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the us and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the us 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire competitive products and services and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively we have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end markets and geographies but we cannot provide assurance that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets the failure to effectively adapt our products or services could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business strategy includes acquiring businesses and making investments that complement our existing businesses we may not be able to identify finance and complete suitable acquisitions and investments and any completed acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and service offerings we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain financing or have sufficient cash necessary for acquisitions or successfully complete acquisitions in the future or that completed acquisitions will be successful acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

we may not complete the sale of our valves  controls business in the time frame or on the terms we anticipate 

on august 18 2016 we entered into an agreement to sell our valves  controls business to emerson electric co for a purchase price of 315 billion in cash subject to certain customary adjustments we believe the sale will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017 subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions the completion of the sale is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the satisfaction of the conditions to the completion of the sale the parties to the transactions obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals the occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the sale agreement and our ability to obtain the expected proceeds from the sale these and other factors could impair our ability to complete the sale in the time frame and on the terms we anticipate and this could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our business initiatives 

during 2016  2015  and 2014  we initiated and continued execution of certain business initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business as a result we have incurred substantial expense including restructuring charges we may not be able to achieve the operating efficiencies to reduce costs or realize benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with these initiatives if we are unable to execute these initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations  

we are exposed to political regulatory economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2016  accounted for 41 percent  of our net sales further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from nonus suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 



 our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs we cannot provide assurance however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets as of december 31 2016  our goodwill and intangible assets were 58492 million  and represented 51  of our total assets longterm declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments 

we may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

as of december 31 2016  approximately 9000  of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and work councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes and only minor work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works councils other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within flow  filtration solutions water quality systems and technical solutions in flow  filtration solutions demand for residential water supply products infrastructure and agricultural products follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august in water quality systems enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase in both flow  filtration solutions and water quality systems is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or early buy programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperatures heavy flooding and droughts technical solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere and increased demand for electrical fastening products during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere we cannot provide assurance that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our shares may trade the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims we have experienced an increase in the number of asbestosrelated lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed or withdrawn our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and only where appropriate settling claims before trial as of december 31 2016  there were approximately 3800  claims pending against our subsidiaries of which approximately 3300  relate to the valves  controls business classified as held for sale we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or 

otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the united states 

the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice doj and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the fcpa tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tycos own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj as a result the flow control business may be subject to investigations in other jurisdictions or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are dual use products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to us federal state local and nonus laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as defendant target or a potentially responsible party prp in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of cleanup and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time thus we cannot provide assurance that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks related to certain conflict minerals 

in 2012 the sec adopted disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries as required by section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the final rules impose inquiry diligence and disclosure obligations with respect to conflict minerals defined as tin tantalum tungsten and gold that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by an sec reporting company certain of these minerals are used extensively in components manufactured by our suppliers or in components incorporated by our suppliers into components supplied to us for use in our products under the final rules an sec reporting company must conduct a country of origin inquiry that is reasonably designed to determine whether any of the conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by the company originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country if any such conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country the final rules require the issuer to exercise due diligence on the source of such conflict minerals and their chain of custody with the ultimate objective of determining whether the conflict minerals directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country the issuer must then prepare and file with the sec annually a report regarding its diligence efforts which we have done since the secs reporting requirements became effective we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to conduct country of origin inquiries and to exercise such due diligence 

we have a very large number of suppliers and our supply chain is very complex and multifaceted while we have no intention to use minerals sourced from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries that are not conflict free meaning that they do not contain conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country a significant number of our suppliers are small businesses and those small businesses have limited or no resources to track their sources of minerals as a result we have experienced and expect to continue to experience ongoing significant difficulty in determining the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products and disclosing that our products are conflict free we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products or if we continue to be unable to disclose that our products are conflict free the ongoing implementation of these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of some minerals necessary to the manufacture of our products and may affect the availability and price of conflict minerals capable of certification as conflict free accordingly we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs as a consequence of these rules which may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol and this and other existing international initiatives or those under consideration could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly those involved in the oil and gas power generation petrochemical processing or petroleum refining industries are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services in addition new laws and regulations that might favor the increased use of nonfossil fuels including nuclear wind solar and biofuels or that are designed to increase energy efficiency could dampen demand for oil and gas production or power generation 

resulting in lower spending by customers for our products and services these actions could also increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to pentair and its employees customers dealers and suppliers the secure operation of these information technology systems and networks and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs we have identified attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks to our knowledge no such attack was ultimately successful in exporting sensitive data or controlling sensitive systems or networks should such an attack succeed it could expose us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems the compromising of confidential information theft of assets manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions and breach of privacy which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation competitive position business and results of operations in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

our businesses expose us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we share responsibility for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the distribution 

in connection with the distribution we entered into a tax sharing agreement the 2012 tax sharing agreement with tyco now known as johnson controls international plc johnson controls and the adt corporation adt which governs the rights and obligations of adt johnson controls and us for certain predistribution tax liabilities including johnson controls obligations under a separate tax sharing agreement the 2007 tax sharing agreement entered into by johnson controls covidien ltd now known as medtronic plc medtronic and te connectivity ltd te connectivity in connection with the 2007 distributions of medtronic and te connectivity by johnson controls 

the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that we johnson controls and adt will share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our johnson controls and adts us income tax returns including withholding tax income tax or other tax liabilities that could arise if the merger distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are determined to be taxable for us federal or swiss tax purposes and ii payments required to be made by johnson controls with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement the liabilities in clauses i and ii collectively shared tax liabilities johnson controls is responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities as of december 31 2016 johnson controls has paid 2100 million of shared tax liabilities we and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities we adt and johnson controls will share 20 275 and 525 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million costs and expenses associated with the management of shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20 by us 275 by adt and 525 by johnson controls as of december 31 2016  we have a liability of 133 million recorded for this matter in other noncurrent liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets however the ultimate resolution of these matters and the impact of that resolution are uncertain to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the 2012 tax sharing agreement and indirectly the 2007 tax sharing agreement in excess of the recorded liability there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

in addition under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution the adt distribution the internal transactions or the merger were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or johnson controls the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed as a result thereof if such 

failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or johnson controls then we adt and johnson controls would be responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of such determination in the same manner and in the same proportions as we adt and johnson controls are responsible for shared tax liabilities such tax amounts could be significant 

risks relating to our liquidity 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants including those that limit the amount of our debt which may restrict the operations of our business and our ability to incur additional debt to finance acquisitions our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2016  we had 43 billion  of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate if our cash requirements are more than we expect or if we intend to finance acquisitions we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in ireland and tax residency in the united kingdom 

we are subject to changes in law and other factors that may not allow us to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry 

while we believe that we should be able to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate also the tax laws of the us the uk ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate in particular legislative action could be taken by the us the uk ireland or the european union which could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulations upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to maintain tax residency in the uk and take advantage of the tax treaties among the us the uk and ireland we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

a change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and taxes on dividends 

under current irish legislation a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in ireland if it is centrally managed and controlled in ireland or in certain circumstances if it is incorporated in ireland under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the uk is regarded as resident in the uk for taxation purposes where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the uk and ireland then the provisions of article 43 of the double tax convention between ireland and the uk provide that such enterprise shall be treated as resident only in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated we have managed and we intend to continue to manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the uk and therefore have our tax residency only in the uk however we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be resident only in the uk for tax purposes it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of its affairs we could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the uk if we were considered to be a tax resident of ireland we could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by us could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of our ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold your ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases we may in our absolute discretion pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay any stamp duty our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii will have a lien against the shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against 

future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in our shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us 

our ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €310000 per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents for periods on or after october 12 2016

 item 3 legal proceedings

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2016  there were approximately 3800  claims outstanding against our subsidiaries of which approximately 3300  relate to the valves  controls business classified as held for sale this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2283 million  and 2379 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and was recorded in noncurrent liabilities held for sale  in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1085 million  and 1110 million  respectively at december 31 2016  and 2015  and was recorded in noncurrent assets held for sale  in the consolidated balance sheets 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned businesses we are responsible or alleged to be responsible for ongoing environmental investigation andor remediation of sites in several countries these sites are in various stages of investigation andor remediation and at some of these sites our liability is considered de minimis we received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from similar state and nonus environmental agencies that several sites formerly or currently owned andor operated by us and other properties or water supplies that may be or may have been impacted from those operations contain disposed or recycled materials or waste and require environmental investigation andor remediation those sites include instances where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal state andor nonus environmental laws and regulations for several formerly owned businesses we have also received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 183 million  and 228 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively which relate primarily to the valves  controls business classified as held for sale we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

compliance matters 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tycos own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings we have grown our businesses in significant part in the past through acquisitions financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time by private or public debt issuance our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions we intend to issue commercial paper to fund our financing needs on a shortterm basis and to use our revolving credit facility as backup liquidity to support commercial paper 

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within flow  filtration solutions and water quality systems we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale early buy programs generally including extended payment terms andor 

additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts additionally technical solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was 7024 million  in 2016  or 1047 million   higher  than in 2015  the increase  in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was due primarily to a  1226 million  increase in net income from continuing operations  net of the following noncash items depreciation and amortization loss on sale of businesses trade name impairment and pension and other postretirement expense 

cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 5977 million  in 2015  or 783 million   lower  than in 2014  the decrease  in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was due primarily to changes in noncash pension and other postretirement expenses and increases in net working capital during 2015 

investing activities 

net cash used for  investing activities of continuing operations was 1233 million  in 2016  compared to 20036 million  in 2015  and 939 million  in 2014  the following investing activities impacted our cash flow 

acquisitions

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures in 2016  2015  and 2014  were 1178 million  913 million  and 837 million  respectively we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2017  to be approximately 100 million primarily for capacity expansions of manufacturing facilities located in our lowcost countries developing new products and general maintenance 

financing activities

net cash provided by  financing activities was 12863 million  in 2015  cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was primarily due to cash proceeds received from the september 2015 issuance of senior notes discussed below partially offset by share repurchases repayment of 3500 million of senior notes due 2015 and payment of dividends 

net cash used for  financing activities was 9951 million  in 2014  cash used for financing activities in 2014 included share repurchases payments of dividends and the purchase of the remaining noncontrolling interest in a business partially offset by net receipts of commercial paper and revolving longterm debt to fund our operations in the normal course of business

our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants the most restrictive of which are in the credit facility as updated for the amendments including that we may not permit i the ratio of our consolidated debt plus synthetic lease obligations to our consolidated net income excluding among other things noncash gains and losses before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash sharebased compensation expense up to a lifetime maximum 250 million  of costs fees and expenses incurred in connection with certain acquisitions investments dispositions and the issuance repayment or refinancing of debt ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended the leverage ratio to exceed a 450  to 100  as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on september 30 2016 b 450  to 100  as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on december 31 2016 c 425  to 100  as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on march 31 2017 d 400  to 100  as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on june 30 2017 and e 350  to 100  as of the last day of the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending thereafter and ii the ratio of our ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended to our consolidated interest expense including consolidated yield or discount accrued as to outstanding securitization obligations if any for the same period to be less than 300  to 100  as of the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of the leverage ratio the credit facility provides for the calculation of ebitda giving pro forma effect to certain acquisitions divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements

as of december 31 2016  we had 1224 million  of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

further we plan to utilize a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our valves  controls business to retire a significant portion of outstanding debt and thus reduce our future contractual obligations we believe the sale of the valves  controls business will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2017 subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions

prior to the closing of the merger our board of directors and tyco as our sole shareholder authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares with a maximum aggregate value of 4000 million  following the closing of the merger in october 2012 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares with a maximum dollar limit of 8000 million  the authorization expired on december 31 2015 there is no remaining availability under the 2012 authorizations 

in december 2013 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of 10 billion  the authorization expired on december 31 2016 there is no remaining availability under the 2013 authorization 

in december 2014 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of 10 billion  the authorization expires on december 31 2019  

during the year ended december 31 2015  we repurchased 31 million  of our ordinary shares for 2000 million  we have 8000 million  remaining availability for repurchases under the 2014 authorization 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 



the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business for purposes of the above table arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2016  variable interest rate debt was 9763 million  at a weighted average interest rate of 201  

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2016  was estimated to be 711 million  we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes  and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2016  we had recorded 24 million  for the possible payment of penalties and 110 million  related to the possible payment of interest 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2016  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

commitments and contingencies 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2016  there were approximately 3800  claims outstanding against our subsidiaries of which approximately 3300  relate to the valves  controls business classified as held for sale these amounts include adjustments for claims that are not actively being prosecuted the amounts are not adjusted for claims that identify incorrect defendants or duplicate other 

actions in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2283 million  and 2379 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and was recorded in noncurrent liabilities held for sale  in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1085 million  and 1110 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and was recorded in noncurrent assets held for sale  in the consolidated balance sheets 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned businesses our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 183 million  and 228 million  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively which relate primarily to the valves  controls business classified as held for sale we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

standby letters of credit bank guarantees and bonds 

in certain situations tyco guaranteed flow controls performance to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of flow control in situations where flow control and tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spinoff we will indemnify tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate the potential liability due to the inchoate and unknown nature of these potential liabilities however we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the outstanding value of bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 3310 million  and 4022 million  respectively of which 1566 million  and 2023 million  respectively relate to the valves  controls business classified as held for sale 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate 

assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and longterm business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a six year longterm planning period the six year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated revenues and operating profit beyond 2022  are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate of 30  

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we utilized a discount rate of 90  in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each reporting unit that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2016  2015  and 2014  with each of our reporting units fair value in excess of its carrying value 

during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2015 the oil and gas industry continued to deteriorate leading management to reconsider its estimates for future profitability of the reporting unit and thereby increasing the likelihood that the associated goodwill could be impaired as such we concluded that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 requiring that we test valves  controls goodwill for impairment as a result we reperformed our step one analysis as of december 31 2015 consistent with our annual test the fair value was estimated using both a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach 

the results of our step one goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2015 indicated that the fair value of valves  controls was below its carrying value accordingly we performed the step two test and concluded the goodwill of the valves  controls business classified as held for sale was impaired as a result we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 5152 million  for the year ended december 31 2015 the impairment charge was recorded in income loss from discontinued operations net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names and trademarks proprietary technology backlog and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization 

the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

an impairment charge of 133 million  was recorded in 2016 related to a trade name in technical solutions as the result of a rebranding strategy implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 the trade name impairment charges were recorded in selling general and administrative in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

as noted above during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2015 the oil and gas industry continued to deteriorate leading management to reconsider its estimates for future profitability of the valves  controls and thereby increasing the likelihood that the associated intangible assets could be impaired as such we concluded that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 requiring that we test valves  controls trade names for impairment as a result of this test an impairment charge of 395 million  was recorded in 2015 related to trade names in the valves  controls business classified as held for sale the impairment charge was recorded in income loss from discontinued operations net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

there were no  impairment charges recorded in 2014 for identifiable intangible assets 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor us and nonus definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other postretirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year marktomarket adjustment and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other postretirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments marktomarket adjustments resulted in a pretax charge of 42 million  in 2016  pretax income of 230 million  in 2015  and a pretax charge of 315 million  in 2014  the remaining components of pension expense including service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds available in the marketplace rated aa or higher adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a weightedaverage discount rate for our us plans of 402  in 2016  421  in 2015  and 363  in 2014  the discount rates on our nonus plans ranged from 050  to 400  in 2016  050  to 425  in 2015  and 050  to 425  in 2014  there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2017  

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets for our us plans was 428  for 2016  365  in 2015  and 456  in 2014  the expected rate of return on our nonus plans ranged from 100  to 550  in 2016  100  to 600  in 2015  and 100  to 600  in 2014  the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices 

during 2012 we adopted an investment strategy for our us pension plans with a primary objective of preserving the funded status of the us plans this was achieved through investments in fixed interest instruments with interest rate sensitivity characteristics closely reflecting the interest rate sensitivity of our benefit obligations the shifting of allocations away from equities to liability hedging fixed income investments by reinvesting in fixed income instruments as equity investments were redeemed was completed during 2013 as of december 31 2016  the us pension plans have an approximately 99 percent  allocation to fixed income investments as a result of the adoption of this investment strategy we anticipate the expected rate of return on our us funded pension plans will continue to be consistent with the discount rate 

see item 8 note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension and other postretirement plans 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

we recognize asbestosrelated liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated certain of these liabilities are subject to insurance coverage our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties the process of estimating asbestosrelated liabilities and the corresponding insurance recoveries receivable is complex and dependent primarily on our historical claim experience estimates of potential future claims our legal strategy for resolving these claims the availability of insurance coverage and the solvency and creditworthiness of insurers 

see item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding loss contingencies 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the companys deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis 

and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2016  was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 77  fixedrate debt and 23  variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2016  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 1185 million  decrease or a 1243 million  increase in fair value respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2016  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 98 million  increase or decrease in interest incurred 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are generally the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk at december 31 2016  and 2015  we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with gross notional us dollar equivalent amounts of 4756 million  and 3315 million  respectively changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of aoci and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when the hedged item affects earnings 

in september 2015 we designated the €5000 million 245 senior notes due 2019 the 2019 euro notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency the hedge is intended to reduce but will not eliminate the impact on our financial results of changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar the currency risk related to the net investment hedge is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market exchange rates in effect on december 31 2016  a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 473  million net increase in other comprehensive income conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 579  million net decrease in other comprehensive income however these increases and decreases in other comprehensive income would be offset by decreases or increases in the hedged net investments on our balance sheet due to currency translation

information regarding all reportable segments 

backlog of orders by segment 



backlog from valves  controls consists of business in the energy and industrial verticals generally backlog from valves  controls has a longer manufacturing cycle and products typically ship within six to twelve months of the date on which a customer places an order backlog from flow  filtration solutions water quality systems and technical solutions typically has a shorter manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order a substantial portion of our revenues however result from orders received and product delivered in the same month we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract we expect the majority of our backlog from all segments at december 31 2015  will be filled in 2016  

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities these efforts consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2015  2014  and 2013  were 1196 million  1173 million  and 1228 million  respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document 

risks relating to our business 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial markets and residential markets we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to economic and business cycles important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates and energy and commodity prices the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies mining and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of the above factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could reduce demand for our products and services 

in particular products sold by valves  controls to energyrelated businesses are cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and gas fluctuates lower worldwide demand for oil and gas impacts the economics of oil and gas capital project investments reducing the demand for our products therefore results of operations for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period prices for oil and gas are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas market uncertainty and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control since the latter half of 2014 the price of oil has dropped dramatically a sustained depression of oil prices may result in the reduction or deferral of major capital projects including significant maintenance projects and upgrades lower levels of oil and gas maintenance spend and major capital project activity may result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers we compete based on technical expertise reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms and price some of our competitors in particular smaller companies attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and solutions or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2015  accounted for 52 percent  of our net sales our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principle nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa during 2015 foreign currency translations had a 66 percent  negative impact on our results of operations fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro could continue to adversely affect our reported revenue in future periods in addition currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the us and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the us 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire competitive products and services and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively we have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end markets and geographies but we cannot provide assurance that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets the failure to effectively adapt our products or services could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business strategy includes acquiring businesses and making investments that complement our existing businesses we may not be able to identify finance and complete suitable acquisitions and investments and any completed acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and service offerings we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates obtain financing or have sufficient cash necessary for acquisitions or successfully complete acquisitions in the future or that completed acquisitions will be successful acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrences equity issuances operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of erico global company and any benefit may take longer to realize than we expect 

on september 18 2015 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of erico for approximately 18 billion  the erico acquisition involves the integration of erico’s operations with our existing operations and there are uncertainties inherent in such an integration we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating erico’s operations delays or unexpected difficulties in the integration process could adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition even if we are able to integrate erico’s operations successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of revenue synergies cost savings and operational efficiencies that we expect or the achievement of these benefits within a reasonable period of time in addition we may not have identified all liabilities and other factors regarding erico that could produce unintended and unexpected consequences for us undiscovered factors could result in us incurring financial liabilities which could be material and in us not achieving the expected benefits from the erico acquisition within our desired time frames if at all 

we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our business initiatives 

during 2015  2014  and 2013  we initiated and continued execution of certain business initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and realigning our business as a result we have incurred substantial expense including restructuring charges we may not be able to achieve the operating efficiencies to reduce costs or realize benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with these initiatives if we are unable to execute these initiatives as planned we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits which could adversely affect our business and results of operations  

we are exposed to political regulatory economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2015  accounted for 52 percent  of our net sales further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from nonus suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 7 

 our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

our future revenue depends in part on the existence of and our ability to win new contracts for major capital projects 

a significant portion of our revenue in technical solutions is derived from major capital projects the number of such projects we may win in any year fluctuates and is dependent upon the general availability of such projects and our ability to bid successfully for them if negative market conditions arise fewer such projects may be available and if we fail to secure adequate financial arrangements or required governmental approvals we may not be able to pursue particular projects either condition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we maintain a sizable backlog and the timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is uncertain our inability to convert backlog into revenue whether due to factors that are within or outside of our control could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is subject to a variety of factors that may cause delays many of which including fluctuations in our customers’ delivery schedules are beyond our control this is especially true with respect to major global capital projects where the extended timeline for project completion and invoice satisfaction increases the likelihood for delays in the conversion of backlog related to modifications and order cancellations such delays may lead to significant fluctuations in results of operations and cash flows from quarter to quarter making it difficult to predict our financial performance on a quarterly basis further while we believe that historical order cancellations have not been significant if we were to experience a significant amount of cancellations of or reductions in orders it would reduce our backlog and consequently our future sales and results of operations 

material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs we cannot provide assurance however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

we are exposed to liquidated damages in many of our customer contracts 

many of our customer contracts contain liquidated damages provisions in the event that we fail to perform our obligations thereunder in a timely manner or in accordance with agreed terms conditions and standards liquidated damages provisions typically provide for a payment to be made by us to the customer if we fail to deliver a product or service on time we generally try to limit our exposure to a maximum penalty within a contract however because our products are often components of large and complex systems or capital projects if we incur liquidated damages they may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business 

in certain industries and for certain applications in particular with respect to our pressure relief valves and valves used in the nuclear power generation industry we must obtain certifications for our products or installations by regulators or standards organizations as we expand our products offering into emerging markets we will need to comply with additional and potentially different certification requirements if we fail to obtain required certifications for our products or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets as of december 31 2015  our goodwill and intangible assets were 77455 million  and represented 65  of our total assets longterm declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments for example we recognized a pretax noncash impairment charge of 5547 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  related to goodwill and trade name intangible assets in valves  controls because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

we may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

as of december 31 2015  approximately 10200  of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and work councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes and only minor work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works councils other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within flow  filtration solutions water quality systems and technical solutions in flow  filtration solutions demand for residential water supply products infrastructure and agricultural products follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august in water quality systems enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase in both flow  filtration solutions and water quality systems is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or early buy programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperatures heavy flooding and droughts technical solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere and increased demand for electrical fastening products during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere we cannot provide assurance that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our shares may trade the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 9 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims we have experienced an increase in the number of asbestosrelated lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed or withdrawn our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and only where appropriate settling claims before trial as of december 31 2015  there were approximately 4100  claims pending against our subsidiaries we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we currently record an estimated liability related to pending claims and future claims including related defense costs based on a number of key assumptions and estimation methodologies these assumptions are derived from historical claims experience and reflect our expectations about future claim activities these assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate and accordingly we may incur additional liabilities in the future a change in one or more of the inputs or the methodology that we use to estimate the asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims although it is possible that we will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond what we have currently recorded we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time on an annual basis we review and update as appropriate such estimated asbestos liabilities and assets and the underlying assumptions such an update could result in a material change in such estimated assets and liabilities 

we also record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities there are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestosrelated recoveries such as policy triggers policy or contract interpretation success in litigation in certain cases the methodology for allocating claims to policies and the continued solvency of the insurers or other responsible parties the assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate and as a result actual performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower receivables and cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs we believe it is possible that the 

cost of asbestos claims filed beyond our estimation period net of expected recoveries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the united states 

the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice doj and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the fcpa tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj as a result the flow control business may be subject to investigations in other jurisdictions or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are dual use products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to us federal state local and nonus laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as defendant target or a potentially responsible party prp in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain 

cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of cleanup and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time thus we cannot provide assurance that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks related to certain conflict minerals 

in 2012 the sec adopted disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries as required by section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the final rules impose inquiry diligence and disclosure obligations with respect to conflict minerals defined as tin tantalum tungsten and gold that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by an sec reporting company certain of these minerals are used extensively in components manufactured by our suppliers or in components incorporated by our suppliers into components supplied to us for use in our products under the final rules an sec reporting company must conduct a country of origin inquiry that is reasonably designed to determine whether any of the conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by the company originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country if any such conflict minerals originated in the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country the final rules require the issuer to exercise due diligence on the source of such conflict minerals and their chain of custody with the ultimate objective of determining whether the conflict minerals directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country the issuer must then prepare and file with the sec annually a report regarding its diligence efforts which we have done since the secs reporting requirements became effective we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to conduct country of origin inquiries and to exercise such due diligence 

we have a very large number of suppliers and our supply chain is very complex and multifaceted while we have no intention to use minerals sourced from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries that are not conflict free meaning that they do not contain conflict minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country a significant number of our suppliers are small businesses and those small businesses have limited or no resources to track their sources of minerals as a result we have experienced and expect to continue to experience ongoing significant difficulty in determining the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products and disclosing that our products are conflict free we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in our products or if we continue to be unable to disclose that our products are conflict free the ongoing implementation of these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of some minerals necessary to the manufacture of our products and may affect the availability and price of conflict minerals capable of certification as conflict free accordingly we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs as a consequence of these rules which may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol and this and other existing international initiatives or those under consideration could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly those involved in the oil and gas power generation petrochemical processing or petroleum refining industries are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services in addition new laws and regulations that might favor the increased use of nonfossil fuels including nuclear wind solar and biofuels or that are designed to increase energy efficiency could dampen demand for oil and gas production or power generation resulting in lower spending by customers for our products and services these actions could also increase costs associated with 

our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to pentair and its employees customers dealers and suppliers the secure operation of these information technology systems and networks and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs we have identified attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks to our knowledge no such attack was ultimately successful in exporting sensitive data or controlling sensitive systems or networks should such an attack succeed it could expose us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems the compromising of confidential information theft of assets manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions and breach of privacy which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation competitive position business and results of operations in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

our businesses expose us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to the distribution and the merger 

we share responsibility for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the distribution 

in connection with the distribution we entered into a tax sharing agreement the 2012 tax sharing agreement with tyco and the adt corporation adt which governs the rights and obligations of adt tyco and us for certain predistribution tax liabilities including tyco’s obligations under a separate tax sharing agreement the 2007 tax sharing agreement entered into by tyco covidien ltd now known as medtronic plc medtronic and te connectivity ltd te connectivity in connection with the 2007 distributions of medtronic and te connectivity by tyco the 2007 separation 

the 2007 tax sharing agreement governs the rights and obligations of tyco medtronic and te connectivity with respect to certain pre2007 separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the 2007 separation more specifically tyco medtronic and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tyco’s medtronic’s and te connectivity’s us and certain nonus 2007 and prior income tax returns in addition in the event that the 2007 separation or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 separation by tyco medtronic or te connectivity the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on tyco medtronic or te connectivity as a result thereof if none of the companies is responsible for such failure then tyco medtronic and te connectivity would be responsible for such taxes in the same manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities under the 2007 tax sharing agreement costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties 

the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that we tyco and adt will share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tyco’s and adt’s us income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement the liabilities in clauses i and ii collectively shared tax liabilities tyco is responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities as of december 31 2015 tyco has paid 630 million of shared tax liabilities we and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities we adt and tyco will share 20 275 and 525 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million costs and expenses associated with the management of shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20 by us 275 by adt and 525 by tyco 

tax authorities including the internal revenue service irs have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments in particular with respect to tax years preceding the 2007 separation in connection with examinations of tyco’s and its subsidiaries’ income tax returns the issues and proposed adjustments are generally subject to the sharing provisions of the 2007 tax sharing agreement which may require tyco to make a payment to a taxing authority medtronic or te connectivity in connection with us federal tax audits the irs has raised a number of issues and proposed adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year although tyco has resolve substantially all of the issues and adjustments proposed by the irs for tax years through 2007 it has not been able to resolve matters related to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions during the period as described below tyco has entered into a settlement with the irs intended to resolve the intercompany debt issues for tyco’s 1997  2000 audit cycle however the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in tyco being responsible for a greater amount than it expects under the 2007 tax sharing agreement 

on july 1 2013 tyco announced that the irs issued notices of deficiency tyco irs notices to tyco asserting that several of tyco’s former us subsidiaries collectively owe additional taxes of 8833 million plus penalties of 154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs position described below is ultimately successful 

the irs asserted in the tyco irs notices that substantially all of tyco’s intercompany debt originated during the 1997  2000 period should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and has disallowed interest and related deductions recognized on us income tax returns for those periods totaling approximately 29 billion  if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same tyco intercompany debt in subsequent time periods totaling approximately 66 billion  which tyco has advised us that it expects the irs to disallow under the 2012 tax sharing agreement tyco has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including the distribution tyco has filed petitions with the us tax court contesting the irs proposed adjustments and a trial date has been set for october 2016 

on january 19 2016 tyco announced that it had entered into stipulations of settled issues with the irs intended to resolve all disputes related to the intercompany debt issues for tyco’s 1997  2000 audit cycle currently before the us tax court the stipulations of settled issues are contingent upon the irs appeals division applying the same settlement to all intercompany debt issues on appeal for subsequent audit cycles 2001  2007 and if applicable review by the us congress joint committee on taxation tyco further disclosed that if finalized the tentative resolution would cover all aspects of the controversy described above and before the appeals division of the irs and would result in a total cash payment to the irs in the range of 475 million to 525 million which includes all interest and penalties and that this payment would be subject to the sharing formulas described above in the 2007 and 2012 tax sharing agreements with pentair not being responsible for any payment related to this amount however we cannot provide any assurance that the conditions precedent to this settlement will be met that the intercompany debt dispute is settled with the irs or that the irs will consistently apply the terms of the settlement to all of tyco’s us income tax returns filed subsequent to 2000 

if the irs should successfully assert its position our share of the collective liability if any would be determined pursuant to the 2007 tax sharing agreement and the 2012 tax sharing agreement any payment that tyco is required to make under the 2007 tax sharing agreement including if the irs were to prevail with respect to the matter set forth above could result in a material liability for us under the 2012 tax sharing agreement to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the 2012 tax sharing agreement and indirectly the 2007 tax sharing agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

if the merger distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders or tyco could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

pentair inc and tyco received private letter rulings from the irs in connection with the distribution and the merger regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution and the merger to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the code the merger will qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code certain anticipated postclosing transactions will not prevent the taxfree treatment of the distribution or the merger and section 367a1 of the code will not cause the merger to be taxable to pentair inc shareholders except for a us shareholder who is or will be a fivepercent transferee shareholder within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations but who does not enter into a gain recognition agreement with the irs in addition tyco received a legal opinion confirming the taxfree status of the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and tyco and pentair inc received legal opinions to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code and that section 367a1 of the code will not cause the merger to be taxable to pentair inc shareholders except for a us shareholder who is or will be a fivepercent transferee shareholder within the meaning of applicable treasury 

regulations but who does not enter into a gain recognition agreement with the irs 

the private letter rulings and opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us tyco and pentair inc notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution the internal transactions or the merger should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution the internal transactions or the merger should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in share or asset ownership after the merger 

if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to tyco shareholders for us federal income tax purposes and tyco shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition tyco would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of pentair ltd’s ordinary shares distributed to tyco shareholders on the distribution date over tyco’s tax basis in such ordinary shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however tyco could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable if the merger ultimately is determined to be taxable pentair inc shareholders would recognize taxable gain or loss on their disposition of pentair inc ordinary shares in the merger 

under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution the adt distribution the internal transactions or the merger were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or tyco the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or tyco then we adt and tyco would be responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of such determination in the same manner and in the same proportions as we adt and tyco are responsible for shared tax liabilities such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay certain taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party’s fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party’s obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party’s taxes in addition if another party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco’s and adt’s tax liabilities 

if the distribution or the merger is determined to be taxable for swiss withholding or other tax purposes we could incur significant swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities 

generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to tyco’s shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder as of january 1 2011 distributions to shareholders out of qualifying contributed surplus kapitaleinlage accumulated on or after january 1 1997 are exempt from swiss withholding tax if certain conditions are met kapitaleinlageprinzip tyco has obtained a ruling from the swiss federal tax administration confirming that the distribution qualifies as payment out of such qualifying contributed surplus and no amount will be withheld by tyco when making the distribution 

as a condition to closing of the merger tyco obtained rulings from the swiss federal tax administration confirming i that the merger will be a transaction that is generally taxfree for swiss federal cantonal and communal tax purposes including with respect to swiss stamp tax and swiss withholding tax ii the relevant swiss tax base of an acquisition subsidiary of ours for swiss tax including federal and cantonal and communal purposes iii the relevant amount of capital contribution reserves kapitaleinlageprinzip which will be exempt from swiss withholding tax in the event of a distribution to our shareholders after the merger and iv that no swiss stamp tax will be levied on certain postmerger restructuring transactions 

these tax rulings rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco notwithstanding these tax rulings the swiss federal tax administration could determine on audit that the distribution or the merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for withholding tax or other tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated if the distribution or the merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution ultimately are determined to be taxable for withholding tax or other tax purposes we and tyco could incur material swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities that could significantly detract from or eliminate the benefits of the distribution and the merger in addition we could become liable to indemnify tyco for part of any swiss withholding tax liabilities to the extent provided under the 2012 tax sharing agreement 

risks relating to our liquidity 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants including those that limit the amount of our debt which may restrict the operations of our business and our ability to incur additional debt to finance acquisitions our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2015  we had 47 billion  of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate if our cash requirements are more than we expect or if we intend to finance acquisitions we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in ireland and tax residency in the united kingdom 

we are subject to changes in law and other factors that may not allow us to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry 

while we believe that we should be able to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate also the tax laws of the us the uk ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate in particular legislative action could be taken by the us the uk ireland or the european union which could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulations upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect our effective tax 

rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to maintain tax residency in the uk and take advantage of the tax treaties among the us the uk and ireland we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

a change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and taxes on dividends 

under current irish legislation a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in ireland if it is centrally managed and controlled in ireland or in certain circumstances if it is incorporated in ireland under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the uk is regarded as resident in the uk for taxation purposes where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the uk and ireland then the provisions of article 43 of the double tax convention between ireland and the uk provide that such enterprise shall be treated as resident only in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated we have managed and we intend to continue to manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the uk and therefore have our tax residency only in the uk however we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be resident only in the uk for tax purposes it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of its affairs we could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the uk if we were considered to be a tax resident of ireland we could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by us could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies act which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of our ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold your ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other cases we may in our absolute discretion pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay any stamp duty our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii will have a lien against the shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in our shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us 

our ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax cat could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €280000 per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents for periods on or after october 14 2015

we believe that our production facilities are suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses   




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2015  there were approximately 4100  claims outstanding against our subsidiaries this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2379 million  and 2491 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1110 million  and 1158 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  all of which was acquired in the merger and was recorded in other noncurrent assets  in the consolidated balance sheets 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned businesses we are responsible or alleged to be responsible for ongoing environmental investigation andor remediation of sites in several countries these sites are in various stages of investigation andor remediation and at some of these sites our liability is considered de minimis we received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from similar state and nonus environmental agencies that several sites formerly or currently owned andor operated by us and other properties or water supplies that may be or may have been impacted from those operations contain disposed or recycled materials or waste and require environmental investigation andor remediation those sites include instances where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal state andor nonus environmental laws and regulations for several formerly owned businesses we have also received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 228 million  and 314 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

compliance matters 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within flow  filtration solutions and water quality systems we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale early buy programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts additionally technical solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2015  was estimated to be 699 million  we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes  and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2015  we had recorded 26 million  for the possible payment of penalties and 108 million  related to the possible payment of interest 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2015  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

commitments and contingencies 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2015  there were approximately 4100  claims outstanding against our subsidiaries this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2379 million  and 2491 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1110 million  and 1158 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent assets  in the consolidated balance sheets 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned 

businesses we are responsible or alleged to be responsible for ongoing environmental investigation andor remediation of sites in several countries these sites are in various stages of investigation andor remediation and at some of these sites our liability is considered de minimis we received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from similar state and nonus environmental agencies that several sites formerly or currently owned andor operated by us and other properties or water supplies that may be or may have been impacted from those operations contain disposed or recycled materials or waste and require environmental investigation andor remediation those sites include instances where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal state andor nonus environmental laws and regulations for several formerly owned businesses we have also received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 228 million  and 314 million  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

standby letters of credit bank guarantees and bonds 

in certain situations tyco guaranteed flow control’s performance to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of flow control in situations where flow control and tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spinoff we will indemnify tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate the potential liability due to the inchoate and unknown nature of these potential liabilities however we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the outstanding value of bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 4022 million  and 3701 million  respectively 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of 

uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and longterm business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a six year longterm planning period the six year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated revenues and operating profit beyond 2021  are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate of 30  

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we utilized discount rates ranging from 95  to 125  in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each reporting unit that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2015  2014  and 2013  with all but one of our reporting units fair value substantially in excess of its carrying value in connection with our 2015 annual impairment test we determined that the fair value of our valves  controls reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value by a significant amount the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of this reporting unit was approximately 9 as of the annual impairment testing date if cash flow projections decreased by 105 or if the discount rate increased by 100 basis points this reporting unit would have failed the annual step one test 

during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2015 the oil and gas industry continued to deteriorate leading management to reconsider its estimates for future profitability of the reporting unit and thereby increasing the likelihood that the associated goodwill could be impaired as such we concluded that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 requiring that we test valves  controls goodwill for impairment as a result we reperformed our step one analysis as of december 31 

2015 consistent with our annual test the fair value was estimated using both a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach 

the results of our step one goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2015 indicated that the fair value of valves  controls was below its carrying value accordingly we performed the step two test and concluded the goodwill of valves  controls was impaired as a result we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 5152 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  the impairment is included in impairment of goodwill and trade names in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names and trademarks proprietary technology backlog and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization 

the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

as noted above during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2015 the oil and gas industry continued to deteriorate leading management to reconsider its estimates for future profitability of the valves  controls and thereby increasing the likelihood that the associated intangible assets could be impaired as such we concluded that a triggering event occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 requiring that we test valves  controls trade names for impairment as a result of this test an impairment charge of 395 million  was recorded in 2015 related to trade names in valves  controls 

there was no  impairment charge recorded in 2014 for identifiable intangible assets an impairment charge of 110 million  was recorded in 2013 related to a trade name in technical solutions as the result of a rebranding strategy implemented in the fourth quarter of 2013 these trade name impairment charges were recorded in impairment of goodwill and trade names in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets during 2015  2014  and 2013  we recorded impairment charges of 177 million  209 million  and 166 million  respectively in conjunction with restructuring activities 

percentage of completion revenue recognition 

revenue from certain longterm contracts is recognized over the contractual period under the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed either based on the relationship between the actual costs incurred and the total estimated costs at completion the costtocost method or based on efforts expended for measuring progress towards completion in situations in which this approach is more representative of the progress on the contract than the costtocost method changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed on a regular basis sales and gross profit are adjusted using the cumulative catchup method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values these reviews have not resulted in adjustments that were significant to our results of operations estimated losses are recorded when identified claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor us and nonus definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other postretirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year marktomarket adjustment and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other postretirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments marktomarket adjustments resulted in pretax income of 230 million  in 2015  a pretax charge of 499 million  in 2014  and pretax income of 632 million  in 2013  the remaining components of pension expense including service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds available in the marketplace rated aa or higher adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a weightedaverage discount rate for our us plans of 421  in 2015  363  in 2014  and 451  in 2013  the discount rates on our nonus plans ranged from 050  to 425  in 2015  050  to 425  in 2014  and 050  to 500  in 2013  there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2016  

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets for our us plans was 365  for 2015  456  in 2014  and 375  in 2013  the expected rate of return on our nonus plans ranged from 100  to 600  in 2015  100  to 640  in 2014  and 100  to 650  in 2013  the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices 

during 2012 we adopted an investment strategy for our us pension plans with a primary objective of preserving the funded status of the us plans this was achieved through investments in fixed interest instruments with interest rate sensitivity characteristics closely reflecting the interest rate sensitivity of our benefit obligations the shifting of allocations away from equities to liability hedging fixed income investments by reinvesting in fixed income instruments as equity investments were redeemed was completed during 2013 as of december 31 2015  the us pension plans have an approximately 98 percent  allocation to fixed income investments as a result of the adoption of this investment strategy we anticipate the expected rate of return on our us funded pension plans will continue to be consistent with the discount rate 

see item 8 note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension and other postretirement plans 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

we recognize asbestosrelated liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated certain of these liabilities are subject to insurance coverage our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties the process of estimating asbestosrelated liabilities and the corresponding insurance recoveries receivable is 

complex and dependent primarily on our historical claim experience estimates of potential future claims our legal strategy for resolving these claims the availability of insurance coverage and the solvency and creditworthiness of insurers 

see item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding loss contingencies 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2015  was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 71  fixedrate debt and 29  variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2015  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 1443 million  decrease or a 1521 million  increase in fair value respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2015  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 136 million  increase or decrease in interest incurred 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are generally the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk at december 31 2015  and 2014  we had outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts with gross notional us dollar equivalent amounts of 3315 million  and 2508 million  respectively changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of aoci and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when the hedged item affects earnings 

in september 2015 we designated the €5000 million 245 senior notes due 2019 the 2019 euro notes as a net investment hedge of our investments in certain international subsidiaries that use the euro as their functional currency the hedge is intended to reduce but will not eliminate the impact on our financial results of changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar the currency risk related to the net investment hedge is measured by estimating the potential impact of a 10 change in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro the rates used to perform this analysis were based on the market exchange rates in effect on december 31 2015  a 10 appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 499 million net increase in other comprehensive income conversely a 10 depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a 609 million net decrease in other comprehensive income however these increases and decreases in other comprehensive income would be offset by decreases or increases in the hedged net investments on our balance sheet due to currency translation

new segmentation 

during the first quarter of 2015 we reorganized our business segments to reflect a new operating structure and management of our gbus resulting in a change to our reporting segments in 2015 as part of this reorganization the legacy filtration  process gbu was combined with the legacy flow technologies gbu to form the flow  filtration solutions reporting segment and now operates as a standalone gbu and the water quality systems reporting segment now operates as a standalone gbu all segment information presented throughout this annual report on form 10k with the exception of the table below was prepared based on the reporting segments in place during 2014 

the below table presents sales and segment income under the revised reporting segments valves  controls technical solutions flow  filtration solutions and water quality systems for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 



information regarding all reportable segments 

backlog of orders by segment 



backlog from valves  controls consists of business in the energy and industrial verticals generally backlog from valves  controls has a longer manufacturing cycle and products typically ship within six to twelve months of the date on which a customer places an order backlog from process technologies flow technologies and technical solutions typically has a shorter manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order a substantial portion of our revenues however result from orders received and product delivered in the same month we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract we expect the majority of our backlog from all segments at december 31 2014  will be filled in 2015  

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities these efforts consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2014  2013  and 2012  were 1173 million  1228 million  and 923 million  respectively 

environmental 

environmental matters are discussed in item 3 item 7 and item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

raw materials 

the principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies copper and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

we purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future 

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trademark trade name or brand name 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the termination of patents patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of december 31 2014  we employed 28400  people worldwide of which 9200  were in the us and 10000  were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils we believe that our relations with the labor unions have generally been good 

captive insurance subsidiary 

we insure certain general and product liability property workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary penwald insurance company “penwald” reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses prepenwald liabilities and those of certain nonus operations are established

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document 

risks relating to our business 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial markets and residential markets many of our businesses have experienced periodic economic downturns important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates and energy and commodity prices the businesses of many of our industrial customers particularly oil and gas companies chemical and petrochemical companies mining and general industrial companies are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns during such economic downturns customers in these industries historically have tended to delay major capital projects including expensive maintenance projects and upgrades additionally demand for our products and services may be affected by volatility in energy and commodity prices and fluctuating demand forecasts as our customers may be more conservative in their capital planning which may reduce demand for our products and services 

while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of the above factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers we compete based on technical expertise reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms and price some of our competitors in particular smaller companies attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and 

solutions or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire competitive products and services and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively we have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end markets and geographies but we cannot provide assurance that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets the failure to effectively adapt our products or services could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing businesses these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future or that completed acquisitions will be successful acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

we are exposed to political regulatory economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2014  accounted for 50 percent  of our net sales further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from nonus suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 7 

 our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales outside of the us for the year ended december 31 2014  accounted for 50 percent  of our net sales our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principle nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances may have a significant effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our future revenue depends in part on the existence of and our ability to win new contracts for major capital projects 

a significant portion of our revenue in technical solutions is derived from major capital projects the number of such projects we may win in any year fluctuates and is dependent upon the general availability of such projects and our ability to bid successfully for them if negative market conditions arise fewer such projects may be available and if we fail to secure adequate financial arrangements or required governmental approvals we may not be able to pursue particular projects either condition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we maintain a sizable backlog and the timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is uncertain our inability to convert backlog into revenue whether due to factors that are within or outside of our control could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is subject to a variety of factors that may cause delays many of which including fluctuations in our customers’ delivery schedules are beyond our control this is especially true with respect to major global capital projects where the extended timeline for project completion and invoice satisfaction increases the likelihood for delays in the conversion of backlog related to modifications and order cancellations such delays may lead to significant fluctuations in results of operations and cash flows from quarter to quarter making it difficult to predict our financial performance on a quarterly basis further while we believe that historical order cancellations have not been significant if we were to experience a significant amount of cancellations of or reductions in orders it would reduce our backlog and consequently our future sales and results of operations 

material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs we cannot provide assurance however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

we are exposed to liquidated damages in many of our customer contracts 

many of our customer contracts contain liquidated damages provisions in the event that we fail to perform our obligations thereunder in a timely manner or in accordance with agreed terms conditions and standards liquidated damages provisions typically provide for a payment to be made by us to the customer if we fail to deliver a product or service on time we generally try to limit our exposure to a maximum penalty within a contract however because our products are often components of large and complex systems or capital projects if we incur liquidated damages they may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business 

in certain industries and for certain applications in particular with respect to our pressure relief valves and valves used in the nuclear power generation industry we must obtain certifications for our products or installations by regulators or standards organizations as we expand our products offering into emerging markets we will need to comply with additional and potentially different certification requirements if we fail to obtain required certifications for our products or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets as of december 31 2014  our goodwill and intangible assets were 63500 million  and represented 60  of our total assets longterm declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

during 2014  we recognized an impairment charge related to allocated amounts of goodwill intangible assets property plant  equipment and other noncurrent assets totaling 3801 million  net of a 123 million  tax benefit representing our estimated loss on disposal of the water transport business in australia the impairment charge is included in loss from sale  impairment of discontinued operations net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

we may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

as of december 31 2014  approximately 10000  of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and work councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes and only minor work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works councils other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within process technologies flow technologies and technical solutions in process technologies enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august in flow technologies demand for residential water supply products infrastructure and agricultural products follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase in both process technologies and flow technologies is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperatures heavy flooding and droughts technical solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere we cannot provide assurance that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our shares may trade the market price of our shares may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our shares 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims we have experienced an increase in the number of asbestosrelated lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed or withdrawn our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and only where appropriate settling claims before trial as of december 31 2014  there were approximately 3400  claims pending against our subsidiaries we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we currently record an estimated liability related to pending claims and future claims including related defense costs based on a number of key assumptions and estimation methodologies these assumptions are derived from historical claims experience and reflect our expectations about future claim activities these assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate and accordingly we may incur additional liabilities in the future a change in one or more of the inputs or the methodology that we use to estimate the asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims although it is possible that we will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond what we have currently recorded we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time on an annual basis we review and update as appropriate such estimated asbestos liabilities and assets and the underlying assumptions such an update could result in a material change in such estimated assets and liabilities 

we also record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities there are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestosrelated recoveries such as policy triggers policy or contract interpretation success in litigation in certain cases the methodology for allocating claims to policies and the continued solvency of the insurers or other responsible parties the assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate and as a result actual performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower receivables and cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs we believe it is possible that the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond our estimation period net of expected recoveries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the united states 

the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice “doj” and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the fcpa tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj pursuant to which the flow control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the doj concerning its continuing compliance efforts as a result the flow control business may be subject to investigations in other jurisdictions or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are “dual use” products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal 

penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to us federal state local and nonus laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as defendant target or a potentially responsible party “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of cleanup and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time thus we cannot provide assurance that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks related to certain “conflict minerals” 

in 2012 the sec adopted disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries as required by section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the final rules impose inquiry diligence and disclosure obligations with respect to “conflict minerals” defined as tin tantalum tungsten and gold that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by an sec reporting company certain of these minerals are used extensively in components manufactured by our suppliers or in components incorporated by our suppliers into components supplied to us for use in our products under the final rules an sec reporting company must conduct a country of origin inquiry that is reasonably designed to determine whether any of the “conflict minerals” that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by the company originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country if any such “conflict minerals” originated in the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country the final rules require the issuer to exercise due diligence on the source of such “conflict minerals” and their chain of custody with the ultimate objective of determining whether the “conflict minerals” directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country the issuer must then prepare and file with the sec a report regarding its diligence efforts which we did on june 2 2014 we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs to conduct country of origin inquiries and to exercise such due diligence 

we have a very large number of suppliers and our supply chain is very complex and multifaceted while we have no intention to use minerals sourced from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries that are not “conflict free” meaning that they do not contain “conflict minerals” that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country a significant number of our suppliers are small businesses and those small businesses have limited or no resources to track their sources of minerals as a result we have experienced and expect to continue to experience ongoing significant difficulty in determining the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all “conflict minerals” used in our products and disclosing that our products are “conflict free” we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all “conflict minerals” used in our products or if we continue to be unable to disclose that our products are “conflict free” the ongoing implementation of these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of some minerals necessary to the manufacture of our products and may affect the availability and price of “conflict minerals” capable of certification as “conflict free” accordingly we have 

incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs as a consequence of these rules which may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol and this and other existing international initiatives or those under consideration could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly those involved in the oil and gas power generation petrochemical processing or petroleum refining industries are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services in addition new laws and regulations that might favor the increased use of nonfossil fuels including nuclear wind solar and biofuels or that are designed to increase energy efficiency could dampen demand for oil and gas production or power generation resulting in lower spending by customers for our products and services these actions could also increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to pentair and its employees customers dealers and suppliers the secure operation of these information technology systems and networks and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs we have identified attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks to our knowledge no such attack was ultimately successful in exporting sensitive data or controlling sensitive systems or networks should such an attack succeed it could expose us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems the compromising of confidential information theft of assets manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions and breach of privacy which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation competitive position business and results of operations in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

our businesses expose us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to the distribution and the merger 

we share responsibility for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the distribution 

in connection with the distribution we entered into a tax sharing agreement the “2012 tax sharing agreement” with tyco and the adt corporation “adt” which governs the rights and obligations of adt tyco and us for certain predistribution tax liabilities including tyco’s obligations under a separate tax sharing agreement the “2007 tax sharing agreement” entered into by tyco covidien ltd “covidien” and te connectivity ltd “te connectivity” in connection with the 2007 distributions of covidien and te connectivity by tyco the “2007 separation” 

the 2007 tax sharing agreement governs the rights and obligations of tyco covidien and te connectivity with respect to certain pre2007 separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the 2007 separation more specifically tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tyco’s covidien’s and te connectivity’s us and certain nonus 2007 and prior income tax returns in addition in the event that the 2007 separation or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 separation by tyco covidien or te connectivity the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on tyco covidien or te connectivity as a result thereof if none of the companies is responsible for such failure then tyco covidien and te connectivity would be responsible for such taxes in the same manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities under the 2007 tax sharing agreement costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties 

the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that we tyco and adt will share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tyco’s and adt’s us income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement the liabilities in clauses i and ii collectively “shared tax liabilities” tyco is responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities as of december 31 2014 tyco has paid 520 million of shared tax liabilities we and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities we adt and tyco will share 20 275 and 525 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million costs and expenses associated with the management of shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20 by us 275 by adt and 525 by tyco 

with respect to years prior to and including the 2007 separation tax authorities have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments that are generally subject to the sharing provisions of the 2007 tax sharing agreement and which may require tyco to make a payment to a taxing authority covidien or te connectivity with respect to adjustments raised by the irs although tyco has resolved a substantial number of these adjustments a few significant items remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years as of the date hereof tyco has not been able to resolve certain open items which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany debt issued during the period through the irs appeals process the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in tyco being responsible for a greater amount than it expects under the 2007 tax sharing agreement 

on july 1 2013 tyco announced that the internal revenue service “irs” issued notices of deficiency “tyco irs notices” to tyco asserting that several of tyco’s former us subsidiaries collectively owe additional taxes in the aggregate amount of 8833 million plus penalties of 154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs challenge to tyco’s tax filings as described below is ultimately successful if the irs should successfully assert its position our share of the collective liability if any would be determined pursuant to the 2007 tax sharing agreement and the 2012 tax sharing agreement tyco has filed petitions with the us tax court to contest the irs assessments 

as we have previously disclosed in connection with us federal tax audits of tyco and its subsidiaries the irs has previously raised issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year the adjustments now asserted by the irs under the tyco irs notices primarily relate to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions the irs has asserted in the tyco irs notices that substantially all of the intercompany debt originated during the 1997  2000 period should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and has therefore disallowed interest and related deductions recognized associated with that intercompany debt on the us income tax returns for those periods totaling approximately 29 billion  if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same tyco intercompany debt in subsequent time periods totaling approximately 66 billion which tyco has advised us that it expects the irs to disallow under the 2012 tax sharing agreement tyco has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including the distribution as mentioned above tyco has filed petitions with the us tax court to contest the irs assessments 

any payment that tyco is required to make under the 2007 tax sharing agreement including if the irs were to prevail with respect to the matter set forth above could result in a material liability for us under the 2012 tax sharing agreement to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the 2012 tax sharing agreement and indirectly the 2007 tax sharing agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

if the merger distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders or tyco could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

pentair inc and tyco received private letter rulings from the irs in connection with the distribution and the merger regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution and the merger to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the code the merger will qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code certain anticipated postclosing transactions will not prevent the taxfree treatment of the distribution or the merger and section 367a1 of the code will not cause the merger to be taxable to pentair inc shareholders except for a us shareholder who is or will be a “fivepercent transferee shareholder” within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations but who does not enter into a “gain recognition agreement with the irs in addition tyco received a legal opinion confirming the taxfree status of the distribution for us federal income tax purposes and tyco and pentair inc received legal opinions to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code and that section 367a1 of the code will not cause the merger to be taxable to pentair inc shareholders except for a us shareholder who is or will be a “fivepercent transferee shareholder” within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations but who does not enter into a “gain recognition agreement” with the irs 

the private letter rulings and opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us tyco and pentair inc notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution the internal transactions or the merger should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution the internal transactions or the merger should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in share or asset ownership after the merger 

if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to tyco shareholders for us federal income tax purposes and tyco shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition tyco would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of pentair ltd’s ordinary shares distributed to tyco shareholders on the distribution date over tyco’s tax basis in such ordinary shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however tyco could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable if the merger ultimately is determined to be taxable pentair inc shareholders would recognize taxable gain or loss on their disposition of pentair inc ordinary shares in the merger 

under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution the adt distribution the internal transactions or the merger were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or tyco the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or tyco then we adt and tyco would be responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of such determination in the same manner and in the same proportions as we adt and tyco are responsible for shared tax liabilities such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay certain taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party’s fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party’s obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party’s taxes in addition if another party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco’s and adt’s tax liabilities 

if the distribution or the merger is determined to be taxable for swiss withholding or other tax purposes we could incur significant swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities 

generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to tyco’s shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder as of january 1 2011 distributions to shareholders out of qualifying contributed surplus kapitaleinlage accumulated on or after january 1 1997 are exempt from swiss withholding tax if certain conditions are met kapitaleinlageprinzip tyco has obtained a ruling from the swiss federal tax administration confirming that the distribution qualifies as payment out of such qualifying contributed surplus and no amount will be withheld by tyco when making the distribution 

as a condition to closing of the merger tyco obtained rulings from the swiss federal tax administration confirming i that the merger will be a transaction that is generally taxfree for swiss federal cantonal and communal tax purposes including with respect to swiss stamp tax and swiss withholding tax ii the relevant swiss tax base of an acquisition subsidiary of ours 

for swiss tax including federal and cantonal and communal purposes iii the relevant amount of capital contribution reserves kapitaleinlageprinzip which will be exempt from swiss withholding tax in the event of a distribution to our shareholders after the merger and iv that no swiss stamp tax will be levied on certain postmerger restructuring transactions 

these tax rulings rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco notwithstanding these tax rulings the swiss federal tax administration could determine on audit that the distribution or the merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for withholding tax or other tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated if the distribution or the merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution ultimately are determined to be taxable for withholding tax or other tax purposes we and tyco could incur material swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities that could significantly detract from or eliminate the benefits of the distribution and the merger in addition we could become liable to indemnify tyco for part of any swiss withholding tax liabilities to the extent provided under the 2012 tax sharing agreement 

risks relating to our liquidity 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2014  we had 30 billion  of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate or if our cash requirements are more than we expect we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our ordinary shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and 

interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in ireland and tax residency in the united kingdom 

we are subject to changes in law and other factors that may not allow us to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry 

while we believe that we should be able to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry we cannot give any assurance as to what our effective tax rate will be in the future because of among other things uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate also the tax laws of the us the uk ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in our worldwide effective corporate tax rate in particular legislative action could be taken by the us the uk ireland or the european union which could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulations upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect our effective tax rate we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in ireland or limiting our ability as an irish company to maintain tax residency in the uk and take advantage of the tax treaties among the us the uk and ireland we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

a change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and taxes on dividends 

under current irish legislation a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in ireland if it is centrally managed and controlled in ireland or in certain circumstances if it is incorporated in ireland under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the uk is regarded as resident in the uk for taxation purposes where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the uk and ireland then the provisions of article 43 of the double tax convention between ireland and the uk provide that such enterprise shall be treated as resident only in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated we have managed and we intend to continue to manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the uk and therefore have our tax residency only in the uk however we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be resident only in the uk for tax purposes it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of its affairs we could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the uk if we were considered to be a tax resident of ireland we could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by us could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

irish law differs from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

it may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the us against us in ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws in addition there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of us courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the us federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws we have been advised that the united states currently does not have a treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters therefore a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any us federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on us federal or state securities laws would not automatically be enforceable in ireland 

as an irish company we are governed by the irish companies acts which differ in some material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and shareholders including among others differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits likewise the duties of directors and officers of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholders of irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances accordingly holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the us 

transfers of our ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

transfers of our ordinary shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold your ordinary shares directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your ordinary shares could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee 

we currently intend to pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay stamp duty in connection with share transfers made in the ordinary course of trading by a seller who holds shares directly to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially in other 

cases we may in our absolute discretion pay or cause one of our affiliates to pay any stamp duty our articles of association provide that in the event of any such payment we i may seek reimbursement from the buyer ii will have a lien against the shares acquired by such buyer and any dividends paid on such shares and iii may setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends on such shares parties to a share transfer may assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in our shares has been paid unless one or both of such parties is otherwise notified by us 

our ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax “cat” could apply to a gift or inheritance of our ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €225000 per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents

we believe that our production facilities are suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses   




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestos 

containing components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2014  there were approximately 3400  claims outstanding against our subsidiaries this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2491 million  and 2547 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1158 million  and 1196 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  all of which was acquired in the merger and was recorded in other noncurrent assets  in the consolidated balance sheets 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned businesses we are responsible or alleged to be responsible for ongoing environmental investigation andor remediation of sites in several countries these sites are in various stages of investigation andor remediation and at some of these sites our liability is considered de minimis we received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from similar state and nonus environmental agencies that several sites formerly or currently owned andor operated by us and other properties or water supplies that may be or may have been impacted from those operations contain disposed or recycled materials or waste and require environmental investigation andor remediation those sites include instances where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal state andor nonus environmental laws and regulations for several formerly owned businesses we have also received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 314 million  and 348 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

compliance matters 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj pursuant to which the flow control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the doj concerning its continuing compliance efforts

future dividends on our ordinary shares or reductions of share capital for distribution to shareholders if any must be approved by our board of directors for payment out of distributable reserves on our statutory balance sheet we are not permitted to pay dividends out of share capital which includes share premiums distributable reserves may be created through the earnings of the irish parent company and through a reduction in share capital approved by the irish high court distributable reserves are not linked to a us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” reported amount eg retained earnings on july 22 2014 the irish high court approved pentair plcs conversion of approximately 144 billion of share premium to distributable reserves on july 29 2014 following the approval of the irish high court we made the required filing of pentair plcs initial accounts with the irish companies registration office which completed the process to allow us to pay future cash dividends and redeem and repurchase shares out of pentair plcs distributable reserves as of december 31 2014 our distributable reserve balance was 121 billion 

the timing declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary shares will depend upon many factors including our financial condition and results of operations the capital requirements of our businesses industry practice and any other relevant factors 

united kingdom tax considerations 

although our jurisdiction of organization is ireland we manage our affairs so that we are centrally managed and controlled in the uk and therefore have our tax residency in the uk 

as a result of its uk tax status dividend distributions by pentair plc to its shareholders are not subject to withholding tax as the uk currently does not levy a withholding tax on dividend distributions

the prorata distribution of 100  of the outstanding ordinary shares of flow control to tyco’s shareholders the “distribution” resulting in the distribution of approximately 1109 million  of our ordinary shares to tyco’s shareholders the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting with pentair inc treated as the acquirer 

on january 30 2014 we acquired as part of process technologies the remaining 199 percent ownership interest in two entities a us entity and an international entity collectively pentair residential filtration or “prf” from ge water  process technologies a unit of general electric company “ge” for 1343 million in cash prior to the acquisition we held a 801 percent ownership equity interest in prf representing our and ges respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses

 liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings we have grown our businesses in significant part in the past through acquisitions financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time by private or public debt issuance our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions we intend to issue commercial paper to fund our financing needs on a shortterm basis and to use our revolving credit facility as backup liquidity to support commercial paper 

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within process technologies and flow technologies we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly 

by heavy flooding and droughts additionally technical solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere

cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was 9313 million  in 2013  or 8654 million   higher  than in 2012  the increase  in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was due primarily to a 4424 million  increase in net income loss before noncontrolling interest  net of the following noncash items depreciation and amortization goodwill and trade name impairment and pension and other postretirement expense also attributing to the increase were accelerated contributions of pension and other postretirement obligations in 2012 that reduced the need for ongoing contributions in 2013

pfsa is authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the amended credit facility pfsa uses the amended credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had 9876 million  and 5289 million  respectively of commercial paper outstanding all of which was classified as longterm as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the amended credit facility 

total availability under the amended credit facility was 11026 million  which was not limited by any covenants contained in the amended credit facility’s credit agreement subsequent to the merger we used the remaining proceeds from the 20172022 notes offering and issuances of commercial paper to redeem the fixedfloating rate notes as discussed above to repurchase shares in conjunction with our share repurchase as discussed in item 8 note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and to purchase the remaining 25 percent  interest in kef for 1000 million  as discussed in item 8 note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements

acquisitions divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements 

in addition to the amended credit facility we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of 783 million  of which none  was outstanding at december 31 2014  borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates additionally as part of 2012 and 2011 acquisitions we assumed certain capital leases with an outstanding balance of 67 million  and 215 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively 

as of december 31 2014  we had 494 million of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

dividends

in december 2014 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of our ordinary shares up to a maximum dollar limit of 10 billion  this authorization is in addition to the 2012 and 2013 share repurchase authorizations the authorization expires on december 31 2019  and there were no repurchases made in 2014 under this authorization 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we repurchased 164 million  of our ordinary shares for 12 billion  pursuant to these authorizations and had no  remaining availability for repurchases under the 2013 authorization 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 



the 3500 million  of principal outstanding on the 2015 notes matures in december 2015 as discussed above we classified this debt as longterm as of december 31 2014 as we have the intent and ability to refinance such obligation on a longterm basis under the amended credit facility as such this obligation is included in the 2019 obligations in the table above the year in which the amended credit facility expires 

the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business for purposes of the above table arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2014  variable interest rate debt was 9974 million  at a weighted average interest rate of 069  

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2014  was estimated to be 621 million  we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes  and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2014  we had recorded 12 million  for the possible payment of penalties and 98 million  related to the possible payment of interest 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2014  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

commitments and contingencies 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2014  there were approximately 3400  claims outstanding against our subsidiaries this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2491 million  and 2547 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1158 million  and 1196 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent assets  in the consolidated balance sheets 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned businesses we are responsible or alleged to be responsible for ongoing environmental investigation andor remediation of sites in several countries these sites are in various stages of investigation andor remediation and at some of these sites our liability is considered de minimis we received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from similar state and nonus environmental agencies that several sites formerly or currently owned andor operated by us and other properties or water supplies that may be or may have been impacted from those operations contain disposed or recycled materials or waste and require environmental investigation andor remediation those sites include instances where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal state andor nonus environmental laws and regulations for several formerly owned businesses we have also received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 314 million  and 348 million  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 

of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

compliance matters 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the us department of justice “doj” and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj pursuant to which the flow control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the doj concerning its continuing compliance efforts 

standby letters of credit bank guarantees and bonds 

in certain situations tyco guaranteed flow control’s performance to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of flow control in situations where flow control and tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spinoff we will indemnify tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate the potential liability due to the inchoate and unknown nature of these potential liabilities however we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the outstanding value of bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 3701 million  and 4840 million  respectively of which 324 million  and 253 million  respectively relate to the water transport business 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 43 

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and longterm business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a six year longterm planning period the six year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated revenues and operating profit beyond 2020  are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate of 30  

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we utilized discount rates ranging from 110  to 120  in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each reporting unit that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

during 2014  we recognized an impairment charge related to allocated amounts of goodwill intangible assets property plant  equipment and other noncurrent assets totaling 3801 million  net of a 123 million  tax benefit representing our estimated loss on disposal of the water transport business in australia the impairment charge is included in loss from sale  impairment of discontinued operations net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of the first day of the fourth quarter of 2014  2013  and 2012  with each reporting unit’s fair value substantially in excess of its carrying value accordingly step two of the impairment analysis was not required for 2014  2013  or 2012  

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names and trademarks proprietary technology backlog and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization there was no  impairment charge recorded in 2014 for identifiable intangible assets impairment charges of 110 million  and 607 million  were recorded in 2013 and 2012 respectively related to trade names these charges were recorded in impairment of trade names in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 

the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the impairment charges recorded in 2013 and 2012 were the result of a rebranding strategies implemented in the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012 respectively 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets during 2014  and 2013  we recorded impairment charges of 209 million  and 166 million  respectively in conjunction with restructuring activities there were no material impairment charges recorded related to longlived assets in 2012  

percentage of completion revenue recognition 

revenue from certain longterm contracts is recognized over the contractual period under the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed either based on the relationship between the actual costs incurred and the total estimated costs at completion “the costtocost method” or based on efforts expended for measuring progress towards completion in situations in which this approach is more representative of the progress on the contract than the costtocost method changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed on a regular basis sales and gross profit are adjusted using the cumulative catchup method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values these reviews have not resulted in adjustments that were significant to our results of operations estimated losses are recorded when identified claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor us and nonus definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 13 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other postretirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year marktomarket adjustment and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other postretirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments marktomarket adjustments resulted in a pretax charge of 499 million  in 2014  pretax income of 632 million  in 2013  and a pretax charge of 1462 million  in 2012  the remaining components of pension expense primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds available in the marketplace rated aa or higher adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a weightedaverage discount rate for our us plans of 363  in 2014  451  in 2013  and 367  in 2012  the discount rates on our nonus plans ranged from 050  to 425  in 2014  050  to 500  in 2013  and 050  to 450  in 2012  there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2015  

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets for our us plans was 456  for 2014  375  in 2013  and 750  in 2012  the expected rate of return on our nonus plans ranged from 100  to 640  in 2014  100  to 650  in 2013  and 100  to 

460  in 2012  the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices 

during 2012 we adopted an investment strategy for our us pension plans with a primary objective of preserving the funded status of the us plans this was achieved through investments in fixed interest instruments with interest rate sensitivity characteristics closely reflecting the interest rate sensitivity of our benefit obligations the shifting of allocations away from equities to liability hedging fixed income investments by reinvesting in fixed income instruments as equity investments were redeemed was completed during 2013 as of december 31 2014  the us pension plans have an approximately 97 percent  allocation to fixed income investments as a result of the adoption of this investment strategy we anticipate the expected rate of return on our us funded pension plans will continue to be consistent with the discount rate 

see item 8 note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension and other postretirement plans 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

we recognize asbestosrelated liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated certain of these liabilities are subject to insurance coverage our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties the process of estimating asbestosrelated liabilities and the corresponding insurance recoveries receivable is complex and dependent primarily on our historical claim experience estimates of potential future claims our legal strategy for resolving these claims the availability of insurance coverage and the solvency and creditworthiness of insurers 

see item 8 note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding loss contingencies 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these 

liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2014  was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 67  fixedrate debt and 33  variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2014  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 925 million  decrease or a 987 million  increase in fair value respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2014  a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a 100 million  increase in interest incurred a decrease in our interest rates on our variablerate debt of 686 basis points to zero would result in a decrease in interest incurred of 68 million  

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of aoci and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when the hedged item affects earnings

pentair ltd took its current form on september 28 2012 as a result of a reverse acquisition the merger involving pentair inc and an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of flow control defined below with pentair inc surviving as an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of pentair ltd flow control refers to pentair ltd prior the merger prior to the merger tyco international ltd tyco engaged in an internal restructuring whereby it transferred to flow control certain assets related to the flow control business of tyco and flow control assumed from tyco certain liabilities related to the flow control business of tyco on september 28 2012 prior to the merger tyco effected a spinoff of flow control through the prorata distribution of 100  of the outstanding common shares of flow control to tyco’s shareholders the “distribution” resulting in the distribution of approximately 1109 million  of our common shares to tyco’s shareholders the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting with pentair inc treated as the acquirer after the merger our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol pnr 

on december 10 2013 pentair ltd entered into a merger agreement the “merger agreement” with pentair plc a newlyformed irish public limited company and subsidiary of pentair “pentairireland” under the merger agreement and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement pentair will merge with and into pentairireland with pentairireland being the surviving company the “redomicile” thereby changing the jurisdiction of organization of the publiclytraded parent company from switzerland to ireland pentair shareholders will receive one ordinary share of pentairireland for each common share of pentair held immediately prior to the redomicile 

upon completion of the redomicile pentairireland intends to manage its affairs so that it is centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom the “uk” and therefore have its tax residency in the uk pentairireland will continue to own and conduct the same businesses as pentair owned and conducted prior to the merger except that pentairireland will replace pentair as the publiclytraded parent company pentairireland will remain subject to us securities and exchange commission “sec” reporting requirements and the applicable corporate governance rules of the new york stock exchange 

the redomicile is subject to pentair shareholder approval of the merger agreement and certain other conditions pentair’s shareholders will be asked to vote to approve the merger agreement at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders which pentair expects to be held during the second quarter of 2014 

we anticipate that having our publiclytraded parent company incorporated in ireland and tax resident in the uk will provide us the following benefits 

 our registered principal office is located at freier platz 10 8200 schaffhausen switzerland our management office in the united states is located at 5500 wayzata boulevard suite 800 minneapolis minnesota 

business and products 

reporting segment and geographical financial information is contained in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k during the fourth quarter of 2013 we reorganized our business segments to reflect a new operating structure and management of our global business units resulting in a change from three reporting segments to four all prior period amounts related to the segment change have been retrospectively reclassified throughout this annual report on form 10k to conform to the new presentation the following is a brief description of each of the company’s reportable segments and business activities 

valves  controls 

the valves  controls segment designs manufactures markets and services valves fittings automation and controls and actuators for the energy and industrial verticals and operates as a standalone global business unit gbu

customers 

process technologies customers include businesses engaged in wholesale and retail distribution in the residential  commercial food  beverage industrial infrastructure and energy verticals customers in the residential  commercial vertical also include endusers and consumers 

seasonality 

we experience seasonal demand with several end customers and endusers within process technologies enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts 

competition 

process technologies faces numerous domestic and international competitors some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the verticals in which we compete competition in filtration  process focuses on product performance and design quality delivery and price for aquatic systems competition focuses on brand names product performance including energyefficient offerings quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also provide us a competitive advantage 

flow technologies 

the flow technologies segment designs manufactures and markets products and services designed for the transfer and flow of clean water wastewater and a variety of industrial applications the flow technologies segment operates as a standalone gbu 

flow technologies is involved in the entire fluid system from transmission and distribution process and control to pumps pipes fittings and couplings from product selection to installation maintenance and servicing flow technologies supports a broad range of products and services specifically tailored to address customers needs for reliable and efficient movement and control of fluids

seasonality 

we experience demand for residential water supply products infrastructure and agricultural products following warm weather trends which are at seasonal highs from april to august also we generally experience increased demand during australia’s prime agricultural seasons seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperatures heavy flooding and droughts 

competition 

flow technologies faces numerous domestic and international competitors some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the verticals in which we compete competition in flow technologies focuses on brand names product performance including energyefficient offerings quality and price while home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps they are not important for commercial pumps for municipal pumps and pipeline systems competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications service and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced 

technical solutions 

the technical solutions segment designs manufactures markets and services products that guard and protect some of the world’s most sensitive electronics and electronic equipment as well as heat management solutions designed to provide thermal protection to temperature sensitive fluid applications the technical solutions segment operates as a standalone gbu 

technical solutions products include mild steel stainless steel aluminum and nonmetallic enclosures cabinets cases subracks backplanes and thermal management systems including heat tracing snow meltingdeicing and temperature management equipment technical solutions products are produced globally 

the portfolio of products serves a range of industries including use in industrial energy residential  commercial and infrastructure verticals brand names for technical solutions offerings include hoffman schroff raychem and tracer technical solutions products are sold largely through a global network of independent distributors and are highly engineered and sold on a project basis via a network of sales and service professionals 

customers 

technical solutions customers include electrical distributors data center contractors original equipment manufacturers contractors mainly of greenfield developments and maintenance contractors technical solutions has developed a global installed base of customers 

seasonality 

technical solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere 

competition 

within technical solutions equipment protection faces significant competition in the verticals it serves particularly within the communications industry where product design prototyping global supply price competition and customer service are significant factors however consolidation globalization and outsourcing are visible trends in the marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier the industries and verticals served by the thermal management business are highly fragmented comprising local markets and niches 

information regarding all reportable segments 

backlog of orders by segment 



backlog from valves  controls consists of business in the energy and industrial verticals generally backlog from valves  controls has a longer manufacturing cycle and products typically ship within six to twelve months of the date on which a customer places an order backlog from process technologies flow technologies and technical solutions typically has a shorter manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order a substantial portion of our revenues however result from orders received and product delivered in the same month we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract we expect the majority of our backlog from all segments at december 31 2013  will be filled in 2014  

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities these efforts consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2013  2012  and 2011  were 1258 million  936 million  and 782 million  respectively 

environmental 

environmental matters are discussed in item 3 item 7 and item 8 note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

raw materials 

the principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies copper and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

we purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future 

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trademark trade name or brand name 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the termination of patents patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

employees 

as of december 31 2013  we employed 28600  people worldwide of which 9300  were in the united states and 10900  were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils we believe that our relations with the labor unions have generally been good 

captive insurance subsidiary 

we insure certain general and product liability property workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary penwald insurance company “penwald” reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses prepenwald liabilities and those of certain nonus operations are established 

matters pertaining to penwald are discussed in item 3 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements – insurance subsidiary included in this form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document while we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting us there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in the future 

risks relating to our business 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial markets and residential markets many of our businesses have experienced periodic economic downturns important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates and energy and commodity prices while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of these factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers we compete based on technical expertise reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms and price some of our competitors in particular smaller companies attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and solutions or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire competitive products and services and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively we have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end markets and geographies but we cannot provide assurance that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets the failure to effectively adapt our products or services could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing businesses these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future or that completed acquisitions will be successful acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

we are exposed to political regulatory economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the united states for the year ended december 31 2013  accounted for 54 percent  of our net sales further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from nonus suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

sales outside of the united states for the year ended december 31 2013  accounted for 54 percent  of our net sales our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principle nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances may have a significant effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our future revenue depends in part on the existence of and our ability to win new contracts for major capital projects 

a significant portion of our revenue in technical solutions and flow technologies is derived from major capital projects including water pipeline and desalination projects in flow technologies the number of such projects we may win in any year fluctuates and is dependent upon the general availability of such projects and our ability to bid successfully for them if negative market conditions arise fewer such projects may be available and if we fail to secure adequate financial arrangements or required governmental approvals we may not be able to pursue particular projects either condition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we maintain a sizable backlog and the timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is uncertain our inability to convert backlog into revenue whether due to factors that are within or outside of our control could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is subject to a variety of factors that may cause delays many of which including fluctuations in our customers’ delivery schedules are beyond our control this is especially true with respect to major global capital projects where the extended timeline for project completion and invoice satisfaction increases the likelihood for delays in the conversion of backlog related to modifications and order cancellations such delays may lead to significant fluctuations in results of operations and cash flows from quarter to quarter making it difficult to predict our financial performance on a quarterly basis further while we believe that historical order cancellations have not been significant if we were to experience a significant amount of cancellations of or reductions in orders it would reduce our backlog and consequently our future sales and results of operations 

material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs we cannot provide assurance however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

we are exposed to liquidated damages in many of our customer contracts 

many of our customer contracts contain liquidated damages provisions in the event that we fail to perform our obligations thereunder in a timely manner or in accordance with agreed terms conditions and standards liquidated damages provisions typically provide for a payment to be made by us to the customer if we fail to deliver a product or service on time we generally try to limit our exposure to a maximum penalty within a contract however because our products are often components of large and complex systems or capital projects if we incur liquidated damages they may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business 

in certain industries and for certain applications in particular with respect to our pressure relief valves and valves used in the nuclear power generation industry we must obtain certifications for our products or installations by regulators or standards organizations as we expand our products offering into emerging markets we will need to comply with additional and potentially different certification requirements if we fail to obtain required certifications for our products or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets as of december 31 2013  our goodwill and intangible assets were 69103 million  and represented 59  of our total assets longterm declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in the fourth quarter of each year we complete our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment reviews as a result we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 110 million  and 607 million  for trade name intangibles in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 2012 respectively these represent impairments of a trade name in technical solutions in 2013  and trade names in flow technologies process technologies and technical solutions in 2012 the impairment charges were the result of rebranding strategies implemented in the fourth quarter of 2013  and 2012 in the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 2005 million  for goodwill in process technologies the goodwill impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions and due to continued softness in the endmarkets served by residential water treatment components 

we may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

as of december 31 2013  10900  of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and work councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes and only minor work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works councils other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within process technologies flow technologies and technical solutions in process technologies enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august in flow technologies demand for residential water supply products infrastructure and agricultural products follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase in both process technologies and flow technologies is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts also in flow technologies we generally experience increased demand during australia’s prime agricultural seasons seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperatures heavy flooding and droughts technical solutions generally experiences increased demand for thermal protection products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere we cannot provide assurance that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common shares may trade the market price of our common shares may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

  

 9 

 stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims we have experienced an increase in the number of asbestosrelated lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed or withdrawn our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and only where appropriate settling claims before trial as of december 31 2013  there were approximately 2000  lawsuits pending against our subsidiaries a lawsuit might include several claims and we have approximately 2200  claims outstanding as of december 31 2013  we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we currently record an estimated liability related to pending claims and future claims including related defense costs based on a number of key assumptions and estimation methodologies these assumptions are derived from historical claims experience and reflect our expectations about future claim activities these assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate and accordingly we may incur additional liabilities in the future a change in one or more of the inputs or the methodology that we use to estimate the asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims although it is possible that we will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond what we have currently recorded we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time on an annual basis we review and update as appropriate such estimated asbestos liabilities and assets and the underlying assumptions such an update could result in a material change in such estimated assets and liabilities 

we also record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities there are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestosrelated recoveries such as policy triggers policy or contract interpretation success in litigation in certain cases the methodology for allocating claims to policies and the continued solvency of the insurers or other responsible parties the assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate and as a result actual performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower receivables and cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs we believe it is possible that the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond our estimation period net of expected recoveries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the united states 

the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice “doj” and the sec increased enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the fcpa tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj pursuant to which the flow control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the doj concerning its continuing compliance efforts as a result the flow control business may be subject to investigations in other jurisdictions or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are “dual use” products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

legislative action by the us congress could adversely affect us 

legislative action could be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulation upon which we rely we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in switzerland or limiting our ability as a swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between switzerland and the united states we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to us federal state local and nonus laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional 

permits that we may require compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as defendant target or a potentially responsible party “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of cleanup and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time thus we cannot provide assurance that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks related to certain “conflict minerals 

in 2012 the sec adopted disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries as required by section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the final rules impose inquiry diligence and disclosure obligations with respect to “conflict minerals” defined as tin tantalum tungsten and gold that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by an sec reporting company the first disclosure deadline under the final rules is may 31 2014 and by that date an sec reporting company must make disclosures regarding products it sold in calendar 2013 certain of these minerals are used extensively in components manufactured by our suppliers or in components incorporated by our suppliers into components supplied to us for use in our products under the final rules an sec reporting company must conduct a country of origin inquiry that is reasonably designed to determine whether any of the “conflict minerals” that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by the company originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country if any such “conflict minerals” originated in the democratic republic of congo or an adjoining country the final rules require the issuer to exercise due diligence on the source of such “conflict minerals” and their chain of custody with the ultimate objective of determining whether the “conflict minerals” directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country the issuer must then prepare and file with the sec a report regarding its diligence efforts we have incurred and expect to incur significant costs to conduct our country of origin inquiry and if necessary to exercise such due diligence 

we have a very large number of suppliers and our supply chain is very complex and multifaceted while we have no intention to use minerals sourced from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining countries that are not “conflict free” meaning that they do not contain “conflict minerals” that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country a significant number of our suppliers are small businesses and those small businesses have limited or no resources to track their sources of minerals as a result we expect significant difficulty in determining the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all “conflict minerals” used in our products and disclosing that our products are “conflict free” we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all “conflict minerals” used in our products or if we are unable to disclose that our products are “conflict free” implementation of these rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of some minerals necessary to the manufacture of our products and may affect the availability and price of “conflict minerals” capable of certification as “conflict free” accordingly we may incur significant costs as a consequence of these rules which may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol and this and other existing international initiatives or those under consideration could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly those involved in the oil and gas power generation petrochemical processing or petroleum refining industries are subject to any of these or other similar 

proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services in addition new laws and regulations that might favor the increased use of nonfossil fuels including nuclear wind solar and biofuels or that are designed to increase energy efficiency could dampen demand for oil and gas production or power generation resulting in lower spending by customers for our products and services these actions could also increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems networks products and services we are exposed to potential regulatory financial and reputational risks relating to the protection of our data 

we rely upon information technology systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities some of which are managed by third parties additionally we collect and store data that is sensitive to pentair and its employees customers dealers and suppliers the secure operation of these information technology systems and networks and the processing and maintenance of this data is critical to our business operations and strategy information technology security threats  from user error to attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems networks and data  are increasing in frequency and sophistication attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats these threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of the data we process and maintain establishing systems and processes to address these threats and changes in legal requirements relating to data collection and storage may increase our costs we have identified attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and networks to our knowledge no such attack was ultimately successful in exporting sensitive data or controlling sensitive systems or networks should such an attack succeed it could expose us and our employees customers dealers and suppliers to misuse of information or systems the compromising of confidential information theft of assets manipulation and destruction of data defective products production downtimes and operations disruptions and breach of privacy which may require notification under data privacy and other applicable laws the occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our reputation competitive position business and results of operations in addition such breaches in security could result in litigation regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

our businesses expose us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to the distribution and the merger 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the merger 

the benefits that are expected to result from the merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the merger our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of the pentair inc and flow control businesses even if we are able to integrate the pentair inc and flow control businesses successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the pentair inc and flow control businesses while we anticipate that certain expenses will be incurred such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses 

the integration of the pentair inc and flow control businesses following the merger may present significant challenges 

there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating the pentair inc and flow control businesses these difficulties include 

 13 

 the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of the pentair inc and flow control businesses members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process the pentair inc and flow control businesses could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate the pentair inc and flow control businesses the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we share responsibility for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the distribution 

in connection with the distribution we entered into a tax sharing agreement the “2012 tax sharing agreement” with tyco and the adt corporation “adt” which governs the rights and obligations of adt tyco and us for certain predistribution tax liabilities including tycos obligations under a separate tax sharing agreement the “2007 tax sharing agreement” entered into by tyco covidien ltd “covidien” and te connectivity ltd “te connectivity” in connection with the 2007 distributions of covidien and te connectivity by tyco the “2007 separation” 

the 2007 tax sharing agreement governs the rights and obligations of tyco covidien and te connectivity with respect to certain pre2007 separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the 2007 separation more specifically tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tycos covidiens and te connectivitys us and certain nonus 2007 and prior income tax returns in addition in the event that the 2007 separation or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 separation by tyco covidien or te connectivity the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on tyco covidien or te connectivity as a result thereof if none of the companies is responsible for such failure then tyco covidien and te connectivity would be responsible for such taxes in the same manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities under the 2007 tax sharing agreement costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties 

the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that we tyco and adt will share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tycos and adts us income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement the liabilities in clauses i and ii collectively “shared tax liabilities” tyco is responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities we and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities we adt and tyco will share 20 275 and 525 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million costs and expenses associated with the management of shared tax liabilities will generally be shared 20 by us 275 by adt and 525 by tyco 

with respect to years prior to and including the 2007 separation tax authorities have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments that are generally subject to the sharing provisions of the 2007 tax sharing agreement and which may require tyco to make a payment to a taxing authority covidien or te connectivity with respect to adjustments raised by the irs although tyco has resolved a substantial number of these adjustments a few significant items remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years as of the date hereof tyco has not been able to resolve certain open items which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany debt issued during the period through the irs appeals process the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in tyco being responsible for a greater amount than it expects under the 2007 tax sharing agreement 

on july 1 2013 tyco announced that the internal revenue service “irs” issued notices of deficiency “tyco irs notices” to tyco asserting that several of tycos former us subsidiaries collectively owe additional taxes in the aggregate amount of 8833 million plus penalties of 154 million based on audits of the 1997 through 2000 tax years of tyco and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time these amounts exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs challenge to tycos tax filings as described below is ultimately successful if the irs should successfully assert its position our share of the collective liability if any would be determined pursuant to the 2007 tax sharing agreement and the 2012 tax sharing agreement tyco has filed petitions with the us tax court to contest the irs assessments 

as we have previously disclosed in connection with us federal tax audits of tyco and its subsidiaries the irs has previously raised issues and proposed tax adjustments for periods beginning with the 1997 tax year the adjustments now asserted by the 

irs under the tyco irs notices primarily relate to the treatment of certain intercompany debt transactions the irs has asserted in the tyco irs notices that substantially all of the intercompany debt originated during the 1997  2000 period should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes and has therefore disallowed interest and related deductions recognized associated with that intercompany debt on the us income tax returns for those periods totaling approximately 29 billion  if the irs is successful in asserting its claim it would have an adverse impact on interest deductions related to the same tyco intercompany debt in subsequent time periods totaling approximately 66 billion which tyco has advised us that it expects the irs to disallow under the 2012 tax sharing agreement tyco has the right to administer control and settle all us income tax audits for periods prior to and including the distribution as mentioned above tyco has filed petitions with the us tax court to contest the irs assessments 

any payment that tyco is required to make under the 2007 tax sharing agreement including if the irs were to prevail with respect to the matter set forth above could result in a material liability for us under the 2012 tax sharing agreement to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the 2012 tax sharing agreement and indirectly the 2007 tax sharing agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

if the merger distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders or tyco could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

pentair inc and tyco received private letter rulings from the irs in connection with the distribution and the merger regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution and the merger to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the code the merger will qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code certain anticipated postclosing transactions will not prevent the taxfree treatment of the distribution or the merger and section 367a1 of the code will not cause the merger to be taxable to pentair inc shareholders except for a us shareholder who is or will be a “fivepercent transferee shareholder” within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations but who does not enter into a “gain recognition agreement with the irs in addition tyco received a legal opinion confirming the taxfree status of the distribution for us federal income tax purposes 

and tyco and pentair inc received legal opinions to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code and that section 367a1 of the code will not cause the merger to be taxable to pentair inc shareholders except for a us shareholder who is or will be a “fivepercent transferee shareholder” within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations but who does not enter into a “gain recognition agreement” with the irs 

the private letter rulings and opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us tyco and pentair inc notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution the internal transactions or the merger should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution the internal transactions or the merger should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in share or asset ownership after the merger 

if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to tyco shareholders for us federal income tax purposes and tyco shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition tyco would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares distributed to tyco shareholders on the distribution date over tyco’s tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however tyco could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable if the merger ultimately is determined to be taxable pentair inc shareholders would recognize taxable gain or loss on their disposition of pentair inc common shares in the merger 

under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution the adt distribution the internal transactions or the merger were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or tyco the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or tyco then we adt and tyco would be responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of such determination in the same manner and in the same proportions as we adt and tyco are responsible for shared tax liabilities such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay certain taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party’s fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party’s obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party’s taxes in addition if another party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be 

legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco’s and adt’s tax liabilities 

if the distribution or the merger are determined to be taxable for swiss withholding or other tax purposes we could incur significant swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities 

generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to tyco’s shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder as of january 1 2011 distributions to shareholders out of qualifying contributed surplus  kapitaleinlage  accumulated on or after january 1 1997 are exempt from swiss withholding tax if certain conditions are met  kapitaleinlageprinzip  tyco has obtained a ruling from the swiss federal tax administration confirming that the distribution qualifies as payment out of such qualifying contributed surplus and no amount will be withheld by tyco when making the distribution 

as a condition to closing of the merger tyco obtained rulings from the swiss federal tax administration confirming i that the merger will be a transaction that is generally taxfree for swiss federal cantonal and communal tax purposes including with respect to swiss stamp tax and swiss withholding tax ii the relevant swiss tax base of an acquisition subsidiary of ours for swiss tax including federal and cantonal and communal purposes iii the relevant amount of capital contribution reserves  kapitaleinlageprinzip  which will be exempt from swiss withholding tax in the event of a distribution to our shareholders after the merger and iv that no swiss stamp tax will be levied on certain postmerger restructuring transactions 

these tax rulings rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco notwithstanding these tax rulings the swiss federal tax administration could determine on audit that the distribution or the merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for withholding tax or other tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated if the distribution or the merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution ultimately are determined to be taxable for withholding tax or other tax purposes we and tyco could incur material swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities that could significantly detract from or eliminate the benefits of the distribution and the merger in addition we could become liable to indemnify tyco for part of any swiss withholding tax liabilities to the extent provided under the 2012 tax sharing agreement 

we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

our ability to engage in desirable strategic transactions or equity issuances could be significantly limited or restricted in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distribution and certain related transactions even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporatelevel gain to tyco under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares or tyco’s shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution any acquisitions or issuances of our shares or tyco’s shares within two years after the distribution are generally presumed to be part of such a plan although we or tyco may be able to rebut that presumption for purposes of this test the merger might be treated as part of such a plan or series of related transactions but if so would not by itself cause the distribution to be taxable to tyco since pentair inc shareholders acquired less than 50 of our common shares in the merger the change in ownership resulting from the merger if treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution would be aggregated with other acquisitions or issuances of our shares that occur as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution in determining whether a 50 change in ownership has occurred the process for determining whether a change of ownership has occurred under the tax rules is complex inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case if we do not carefully monitor our compliance with these rules we could inadvertently cause or permit a change of ownership to occur triggering our obligation to indemnify tyco or adt pursuant to the 2012 tax sharing agreement 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to tyco of the distribution under the 2012 tax sharing agreement we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being taxfree further for the twoyear period following the distribution without obtaining the consent of tyco and adt a private letter ruling from the irs or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm we may be prohibited from among other things 

 16 

 these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business moreover the 2012 tax sharing agreement also provides that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on tyco or any of its affiliates or on adt or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the distribution by or in respect of us any of our affiliates or our shareholders 

risks relating to our liquidity 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of common shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2013  we had 26 billion  of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate or if our cash requirements are more than we expect we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected also regardless of the terms of our financings the amount of our shares that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our shares may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for tyco under section 355e of the code and under the 2012 tax sharing agreement we could be required to indemnify tyco for that tax see discussion under “we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the distribution and the merger because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions” 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and 

interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in switzerland 

our status as a swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

swiss law allows shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without additional shareholder approval this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe to any new issuance of shares swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 

under swiss law a swiss corporation may pay dividends only if the corporation has sufficient distributable profits from previous fiscal years or if the corporation has distributable reserves each as evidenced by its audited statutory balance sheet distributable reserves are generally recorded either as “free reserves” or as “qualifying contributed surplus” contributions received from shareholders in “capital contribution reserve” distributions may be made out of registered share capital—the aggregate par value of a company’s registered shares—only by way of a capital reduction after the merger the amount available for future dividends or capital reductions from reserve from capital contributions on a swiss withholding tax free basis is chf 88 billion we will not be able to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders on a swiss withholding tax free basis in excess of that amount unless we increase our share capital or our reserves from capital contributions we would also be able to pay dividends out of distributable profits or freely distributable reserves but such dividends would be subject to swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient distributable profits free reserves reserves from capital contributions or registered share capital to pay a dividend or effect a capital reduction or that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for dividend payments or distributions as a result of capital reductions 

generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to our shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder unless the distribution is made to shareholders out of i a reduction of par value or ii assuming certain conditions are met qualifying contributed surplus accumulated on or after january 1 1997 a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income the “usswiss treaty” may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting shares or for a full refund in the case of qualified pension funds there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient qualifying contributed surplus to pay dividends free from swiss withholding tax or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future in addition there can be no assurance that the current swiss law with respect to distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus will not be changed or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions there are currently motions pending in the swiss parliament that purport to limit the distribution of qualifying contributed surplus in addition over the long term the amount of par value available to us for par value reductions or qualifying contributed surplus available to us to pay out as distributions is limited if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or out of qualifying contributed surplus we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 

under present swiss tax laws repurchases of shares for the purposes of cancellation are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the repurchase price and the par value except since january 1 2011 to the extent attributable to qualifying contributed surplus  kapitaleinlagereserven  if any if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves the swiss withholding tax becomes due no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period 

although we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a “second trading line” on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors sell shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax if we are unable to use this process successfully we may not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without triggering swiss withholding tax if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made 

out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that taxfree qualifying contributed surplus is attributable to the share repurchase 

changes in the us dollarswiss franc exchange rate could limit the amount of dividends authorized on our common shares and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to pay dividends on our common shares 

on april 29 2013 our shareholders approved at our 2013 annual general meeting of shareholders a proposal to pay quarterly cash dividends through the second quarter of 2014 the authorization provides that a dividend will be made out of our “contributed surplus” equity position in our statutory accounts to our shareholders in the amount of 025 for each of the third and fourth quarters of 2013 and the first and second quarters of 2014 the deduction to our contributed surplus in our statutory accounts which is required to be made in swiss francs will be determined based on the aggregate amount of the dividend and will be calculated based on the us dollarswiss franc exchange rate in effect on april 29 2013 the us dollar amount of the dividend will be capped at an amount such that the aggregate reduction to our contributed surplus will not exceed 396 million swiss francs to the extent that a dividend payment would exceed the cap the us dollar per share amount of the current or future dividends will be reduced on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate amount of all dividends paid does not exceed the cap in addition the aggregate reduction in contributed surplus will be increased for any shares issued and decreased for any shares acquired after april 29 2013 and before the record date for the applicable dividend payment 

any future dividends that may be proposed by our board of directors will be subject to approval by our shareholders at our annual general meeting there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve dividends whether our board of directors exercises its discretion to propose any dividends to holders of our common shares will depend on many factors including our financial condition earnings capital requirements of our business covenants associated with debt obligations legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividend in the future 

swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

because of differences between swiss law and us state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of swiss companies and those incorporated in the us it may not be possible to enforce in switzerland court judgments obtained in the united states against us based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states as a result in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws us investors may find it difficult to 

 original actions against persons in switzerland based solely upon the us federal or state securities laws are governed among other things by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on private international law this statute provides that the application of provisions of nonswiss law by the courts in switzerland shall be precluded if the result was incompatible with swiss public policy also mandatory provisions of swiss law may be applicable regardless of any other law that would otherwise apply 

switzerland and the united states do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the recognition and enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the united states in switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on private international law this statute provides in principle that a judgment rendered by a nonswiss court may be enforced in switzerland only if

risks relating to our proposed redomicile 

the anticipated benefits of the redomicile may not be realized 

we may not realize the benefits we anticipate from the redomicile our failure to realize those benefits could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the rights of pentair shareholders will change as a result of the redomicile 

the completion of the redomicile will change the governing law that applies to our shareholders from swiss law which applies to the pentair common shares to irish law which applies to pentairireland ordinary shares many of the principal attributes of pentair common shares and pentairireland ordinary shares will be materially similar however if the redomicile is completed pentair shareholders’ future rights as shareholders under irish corporate law will differ from their current rights as a shareholder under swiss corporate law in addition pentairireland’s proposed articles of association will differ from the pentair articles of association and organizational regulations 

a change in our tax residency could have a negative effect on our future profitability and taxes on dividends 

under current irish legislation a company is regarded as resident for tax purposes in ireland if it is centrally managed and controlled in ireland or in certain circumstances if it is incorporated in ireland under current uk legislation a company that is centrally managed and controlled in the uk is regarded as resident in the uk for taxation purposes where a company is treated as tax resident under the domestic laws of both the uk and ireland then the provisions of article 43 of the double tax convention between ireland and the uk provide that such enterprise shall be treated as resident only in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated upon completion of the redomicile pentairireland intends to manage its affairs so that it is centrally managed and controlled in the uk and therefore has its tax residency only in the uk however we cannot provide assurance that pentairireland will continue to be resident only in the uk for tax purposes it is possible that in the future whether as a result of a change in law or the practice of any relevant tax authority or as a result of any change in the conduct of its affairs pentairireland could become or be regarded as having become resident in a jurisdiction other than the uk if pentairireland was considered to be a tax resident of ireland pentairireland could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividends paid by it could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax 

we will remain subject to changes in law and other factors after the redomicile that may not allow pentairireland to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in pentair’s industry 

while we believe that the redomicile should not affect our ability to maintain a worldwide effective corporate tax rate that is competitive in our industry we cannot give any assurance as to what pentairireland’s effective tax rate will be after the redomicile because of among other things uncertainty regarding tax policies of the jurisdictions where pentair operates also the tax laws of the us the uk ireland and other jurisdictions could change in the future and such changes could cause a material change in pentairireland’s worldwide effective corporate tax rate in particular legislative action could be taken by the us the uk ireland or the european union which could override tax treaties upon which we expect to rely and adversely affect pentairireland’s effective tax rate as a result pentairireland’s actual effective tax rate may be materially different from our expectations 

we expect to incur transaction costs in connection with the completion of the redomicile some of which will be incurred whether or not the redomicile is completed 

we incurred in 2013 and expect to incur in 2014 a total of approximately 14 million in transaction costs in connection with the redomicile a majority of these costs will be incurred regardless of whether the redomicile is completed and prior to the extraordinary general meeting 

pentairireland will seek irish high court approval of the creation of distributable reserves pentairireland expects this will be forthcoming but cannot guarantee this 

under irish law dividends may only be paid and share repurchases and redemptions must generally be funded out of “distributable reserves” which pentairireland will not have immediately following the closing of the redomicile the creation of distributable reserves of pentairireland by way of a capital reduction of pentairireland requires the approval of the irish high court and in connection with seeking such court approval we are asking pentair shareholders to approve the creation of distributable reserves for pentairireland through the reduction of the share premium account of pentairireland at the extraordinary general meeting the approval of the irish high court is expected within approximately six to ten weeks following the closing we are not aware of any reason why the irish high court would not approve the creation of distributable reserves however the issuance of the required order is a matter for the discretion of the irish high court there will also be no guarantee that the approval of the creation of distributable reserves for pentairireland by pentair shareholders will be obtained approval of the creation of distributable reserves by the irish high court may also take substantially longer than pentairireland anticipates in the event that distributable reserves of pentairireland are not created no distributions by way of dividends share repurchases or otherwise will be permitted under irish law until such time as the group has created sufficient distributable reserves from its trading activities 

transfers of pentairireland ordinary shares may be subject to irish stamp duty 

for the majority of transfers of pentairireland shares there will not be any irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty will become payable in respect of certain share transfers occurring after completion of the redomicile a transfer of pentairireland shares from a seller who holds shares beneficially ie through the depository trust company the dtc to a buyer who holds the acquired shares beneficially will not be subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves a change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred shares a transfer of pentairireland shares by a seller who holds shares directly ie not through the dtc to any buyer or by a seller who holds the shares beneficially to a buyer who holds the acquired shares directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of 1 of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired if higher payable by the buyer a shareholder who directly holds shares may transfer those shares into his or her own broker account to be held through the dtc or vice versa without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder has confirmed to pentairireland’s transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the shares as a result of the transfer and the transfer is not in contemplation of a sale of the shares 

because of the potential irish stamp duty on transfers of pentairireland shares we strongly recommend that all directly registered pentair shareholders open broker accounts so they can transfer their shares into a broker account as soon as possible and in any event prior to completion of the redomicile we also strongly recommend that any person who wishes to acquire pentairireland shares after completion of the redomicile acquire such shares through the dtc or another securities depository 

pentairireland does not intend to pay any stamp duty on these transactions however pentairireland’s articles of association allow pentairireland in its absolute discretion to create an instrument of transfer and pay any stamp duty payable by a buyer in the event of such payment pentairireland reserves the right to i seek reimbursement from the buyer or seller at its discretion ii setoff the amount of the stamp duty against future dividends payable to the buyer or seller at its discretion andor iii claim a lien against the pentairireland ordinary shares on which it has paid stamp duty parties to a share transfer should not assume that any stamp duty arising in respect of a transaction in pentairireland ordinary shares will be paid by pentairireland 

pentairireland ordinary shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisitions tax 

irish capital acquisitions tax “cat” could apply to a gift or inheritance of pentairireland ordinary shares irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the parties this is because pentairireland shares will be regarded as property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for cat gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from cat children have a taxfree threshold of €225000 per lifetime in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents 

if pentairireland ordinary shares are not eligible for deposit and clearing within the facilities of the dtc then transactions in pentairireland’s securities may be disrupted 

the facilities of the dtc are a widelyused mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the dtc system which include many large banks and brokerage firms 

upon the completion of the redomicile pentairireland ordinary shares will be eligible for deposit and clearing within the dtc system pentairireland expects to enter into arrangements with the dtc whereby pentairireland will agree to indemnify the dtc for any stamp duty andor stamp duty reserve tax that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for pentairireland’s ordinary shares 

the dtc is not obligated to accept pentairireland ordinary shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities at the closing and even if the dtc does initially accept pentairireland ordinary shares it will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for pentairireland ordinary shares if the dtc determined prior to the completion of the redomicile that pentairireland ordinary shares are not eligible for clearance within the dtc system then we would not expect to complete the transactions contemplated by this proxy statementprospectus in their current form however if the dtc determined at any time after the completion of the redomicile that pentairireland ordinary shares were not eligible for continued deposit and clearance within its facilities then we believe pentairireland ordinary shares would not be eligible for continued listing on a us securities exchange or inclusion in the standard  poor’s 500 index and trading in pentairireland ordinary shares would be disrupted while pentairireland would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve its listing and maintain trading any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the pentairireland ordinary shares 

the uk’s controlled foreign company legislation may apply to pentairireland 

pentairireland is seeking confirmation from hm revenue and customs that either pentairireland will not be subject to the uk’s controlled foreign company “cfc” legislation because it does not satisfy the “gateway” test or that the rules have no material effect because any chargeable profits which pass through the “gateway” benefit from an applicable exemption 

broadly the uk’s cfc rules may subject to uk corporation tax profits in nonuk tax resident subsidiaries which pass through a “gateway” although the rules are complex profits of a nonuk tax resident company should not pass through the “gateway” unless the profits have been artificially diverted from the uk 

the rules should therefore not apply to ordinary trading activities outside the uk in relation to a finance company if profits pass through the “gateway” specific exemptions apply including the “matched interest” rules which broadly speaking will exempt profits from the uk cfc rules if uk members of pentairireland do not have net finance expenses as determined by the uk’s worldwide debt cap rules 

upon completion of the redomicile pentairireland intends to manage its affairs so that the uk cfc rules do not result in any material uk corporation tax liability the treatment is intended to be discussed and agreed with hm revenue and customs but if such agreement is not received and the uk’s cfc rules do indeed apply this may adversely affect pentairireland’s effective tax rate 

we may choose to abandon the redomicile 

we may decide to abandon the redomicile at any time prior to the extraordinary general meeting of pentair shareholders where we will seek shareholder approval of the merger agreement the “extraordinary general meeting” and in some circumstances after obtaining shareholder approval at the extraordinary general meeting after the merger agreement is approved by our shareholders we anticipate filing the application to effect the redomicile unless one of the conditions to completing the redomicile fails to be satisfied and such failure would have a material adverse effect on the redomicile

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and 

make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2013  there were approximately 2000  lawsuits pending against our subsidiaries a lawsuit might include several claims and we have approximately 2200  claims outstanding as of december 31 2013  this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2547 million  and 2789 million  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1196 million  and 1310 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  all of which was acquired in the merger and was recorded in other noncurrent assets  in the consolidated balance sheets 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned businesses we are responsible or alleged to be responsible for ongoing environmental investigation andor remediation of sites in several countries these sites are in various stages of investigation andor remediation and at some of these sites our liability is considered de minimis we received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from similar state and nonus environmental agencies that several sites formerly or currently owned andor operated by us and other properties or water supplies that may be or may have been impacted from those operations contain disposed or recycled materials or waste and require environmental investigation andor remediation those sites include instances where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal state andor nonus environmental laws and regulations for several formerly owned businesses we have also received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 393 million  and 492 million  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

compliance matters 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj pursuant to which the flow control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the doj concerning its continuing compliance efforts

pentair has paid 152 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased dividends each year for 37 consecutive years 

future dividends on our common shares or reductions of registered share capital for distribution to shareholders if any must be approved by our shareholders we expect to obtain shareholder approval of the annual dividend amount out of contributed surplus each year at our annual general meeting and we expect to distribute the approved dividend amount in four quarterly installments the timing declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common shares will depend upon many factors including our financial condition and results of operations the capital requirements of our businesses industry practice and any other relevant factors

overview 

pentair ltd is a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprising four reporting segments valves  controls process technologies flow technologies and technical solutions during the fourth quarter of 2013 we reorganized our business segments to reflect a new operating structure and management of our global business units resulting in a change from three reporting segments to four all prior period amounts related to the segment change have been retrospectively reclassified throughout this annual report on form 10k to conform to the new presentation we now have four reporting segments valves  controls process technologies flow technologies and technical solutions we classify our operations into business segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served for the year ended december 31 2013  valves  controls process technologies flow technologies and technical solutions accounted for 33 percent  23 percent  22 percent  and 22 percent  of total revenues respectively 

pentair ltd took its current form on september 28 2012 as a result of a reverse acquisition the merger involving pentair inc and an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of flow control defined below with pentair inc surviving as an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of pentair ltd flow control refers to pentair ltd prior the merger prior to the merger tyco international ltd tyco engaged in an internal restructuring whereby it transferred to flow control certain assets related to the flow control business of tyco and flow control assumed from tyco certain liabilities related to the flow control business of tyco on september 28 2012 prior to the merger tyco effected a spinoff of flow control through the prorata distribution of 100  of the outstanding common shares of flow control to tyco’s shareholders the “distribution” resulting in the distribution of approximately 1109 million  of our common shares to tyco’s shareholders the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting with pentair inc treated as the acquirer 

in may 2011 pentair inc acquired as part of process technologies the clean process technologies “cpt” division of privately held norit holding bv for 7153 million €5027 million translated at the may 12 2011 exchange rate cpt’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition cpt is a global leader in membrane solutions and clean process technologies in the high growth water and beverage filtration and separation segments 

on january 30 2014 we acquired as part of process technologies the remaining 199 percent ownership interest in two entities a us entity and an international entity collectively pentair residential filtration or “prf” from ge water  process technologies a unit of general electric company “ge” for 1343 million in cash prior to the acquisition we held a 801 percent ownership equity interest in prf representing our and ges respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses 

key trends and uncertainties regarding our existing business 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2013  and 2012  and will likely impact our results in the future 

 in 2014  our operating objectives include the following 

 we may seek to meet our objectives of expanding our geographic reach internationally and expanding our presence in our various channels to market by acquiring technologies and products to broaden our businesses’ capabilities to serve additional markets and through acquisitions we may also consider the divestiture of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on our most attractive markets 

proposed redomicile 

on december 10 2013 pentair ltd entered into a merger agreement the “merger agreement” with pentair plc a newlyformed irish public limited company and subsidiary of pentair “pentairireland” under the merger agreement and subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement pentair will merge with and into pentairireland with pentairireland being the surviving company the “redomicile” thereby changing the jurisdiction of organization of the publiclytraded parent 

company from switzerland to ireland pentair shareholders will receive one ordinary share of pentairireland for each common share of pentair held immediately prior to the redomicile 

upon completion of the redomicile pentairireland intends to manage its affairs so that it is centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom the “uk” and therefore have its tax residency in the uk pentairireland will continue to own and conduct the same businesses as pentair owned and conducted prior to the merger except that pentairireland will replace pentair as the publiclytraded parent company pentairireland will remain subject to us securities and exchange commission “sec” reporting requirements and the applicable corporate governance rules of the new york stock exchange 

the redomicile is subject to pentair shareholder approval of the merger agreement and certain other conditions pentair’s shareholders will be asked to vote to approve the merger agreement at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders which pentair expects to be held during the second quarter of 2014 

we anticipate that having our publiclytraded parent company incorporated in ireland and tax resident in the uk will provide us the following benefits

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings we have grown our businesses in significant part in the past through acquisitions financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time by private or public debt issuance our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions we intend to issue commercial paper to fund our financing needs on a shortterm basis and to use our revolving credit facility as backup liquidity to support commercial paper 

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within process technologies and flow technologies we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 9153 million  in 2013  or 8473 million   higher  than in 2012  the increase  in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a 5013 million  increase in net income loss before noncontrolling interest  net of the following noncash items depreciation and amortization gain on sale of businesses trade name impairment and pension and other postretirement expense income also attributing to the increase were accelerated contributions of pension and other postretirement obligations in 2012 that reduced the need for ongoing contributions in 2013 

cash provided by operating activities was 680 million  in 2012  or 2522 million   lower  than in 2011  the decrease  in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to accelerated contributions of pension and other postretirement obligations in 2012 also attributing to the decrease was a 1023 million  increase in net income loss before noncontrolling interest  net of the following noncash items depreciation and amortization goodwill and trade name impairment and pension and other postretirement expense 

investing activities 

net cash used for  investing activities was 2112 million  in 2013  net cash provided by  investing activities was 3756 million  in 2012  net cash used for  investing activities was 8081 million  in 2011

divestitures 

during 2013  we sold businesses that were part of technical solutions and flow technologies for a cash purchase price of 301 million  and 134 million  respectively net of transaction costs resulting in a net gain of 168 million  and 29 million  respectively 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures in 2013  2012  and 2011  were 1700 million  945 million  and 733 million  respectively the increase  in capital expenditures in 2012 from 2011 was primarily due to the merger we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2014  to be approximately 175 million  primarily for capacity expansions of manufacturing facilities located in our lowcost countries developing new products and general maintenance 

financing activities 

net cash used for  financing activities was 7191 million  in 2013  cash used for financing activities in 2013 included share repurchases and payments of dividends partially offset by net borrowings of commercial paper and revolving longterm debt to fund our operations in the normal course of business and cash received for shares issued to employees

in october 2012 we redeemed the remaining outstanding aggregate principal of our 565 fixed rate senior notes due 20132017 totaling 400 million and our 105 floating rate senior notes due 2013 totaling 100 million the “fixedfloating rate notes” the redemptions included makewhole premiums of 658 million concurrent with the redemption of the fixedfloating rate notes we terminated a related interest rate swap that was designated as a cash flow hedge which resulted in the reclassification of 34 million of previously unrecognized variable to fixed swap losses from aoci to earnings in october 2012 all costs associated with the redemption were recorded as a loss on the early extinguishment of debt  including 06 million of unamortized deferred financing costs 

in september 2012 pfsa completed a private offering of 550 million aggregate principal amount of 315 senior notes due 2022 the “2022 notes” and 350 million aggregate principal amount of 1875 senior notes due 2017 the “2017 notes” and collectively the “20172022 notes” which are guaranteed as to payment by pentair ltd in certain circumstances pfsa may be required to pay additional interest on the 20172022 notes the 20172022 notes remained outstanding after the merger a portion of the net proceeds from the 20172022 notes offering were used to repay 435 million to tyco in conjunction with the distribution and the merger 

in september 2012 pentair inc entered into a credit agreement providing for an unsecured committed revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with initial maximum aggregate availability of up to 1450 million the credit facility replaced pentair inc’s 700 million former credit facility as defined below the credit facility matures in september 2017 upon the completion of the merger pentair ltd became the guarantor under the credit facility and pfsa and certain other of our subsidiaries became affiliate borrowers under the credit facility borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at 

a variable rate equal to the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a specified margin based upon pfsa’s credit ratings pfsa must also pay a facility fee ranging from 100 to 300 basis points per annum based upon pfsa’s credit ratings on the amount of each lender’s commitment 

in may 2011 pentair inc completed a public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes pentair inc used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2021 notes to finance in part the cpt acquisition in 2011 the 2021 notes which remain outstanding subsequent to the exchange offer are guaranteed as to payment by pentair ltd 

in april 2011 pentair inc entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement that provided for an unsecured committed revolving credit facility the “former credit facility” of up to 700 million with multicurrency subfacilities to support investments outside the us borrowings under the former credit facility bore interest at the rate of libor plus 175 we used borrowings under the former credit facility to fund a portion of the cpt acquisition in 2011 and to repay 105 million of matured senior notes in may 2012 the former credit facility was terminated in september 2012 in connection with the merger and replaced by the credit facility at which time the subsidiary guarantees in place under the former credit facility ceased to exist 

pfsa is authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility pfsa uses the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we had 5289 million  and 4247 million  respectively of commercial paper outstanding all of which was classified as longterm as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility 

we used borrowings under the credit facility and proceeds from the 20172022 notes offering to repay the former credit facility and to pay other fees and expenses in connection with the merger total availability under the credit facility was 9211 million  as of december 31 2013  which was not limited by any covenants contained in the credit facility’s credit agreement subsequent to the merger we used the remaining proceeds from the 20172022 notes offering and issuances of commercial paper to redeem the fixedfloating rate notes as discussed above to repurchase shares in conjunction with our share repurchase as discussed in item 8 note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and to purchase the remaining 25 percent interest in kef for 100 million as discussed in item 8 note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants the most restrictive of which are in the credit facility including that we may not permit i the ratio of our consolidated debt plus synthetic lease obligations to our consolidated net income excluding among other things noncash gains and losses before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash sharebased compensation expense and up to 40 million of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger “ebitda” for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended the “leverage ratio” to exceed 350 to 100 on the last day of each fiscal quarter and ii the ratio of our ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended to our consolidated interest expense including consolidated yield or discount accrued as to outstanding securitization obligations if any for the same period to be less than 300 to 100 as of the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of the leverage ratio the credit facility provides for the calculation of ebitda giving pro forma effect to the merger and certain acquisitions divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements 

in addition to the credit facility we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of 867 million  of which none  was outstanding at december 31 2013  borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates additionally as part of the merger and cpt acquisition we assumed certain capital leases with an outstanding balance of 215 million  and 238 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively 

as of december 31 2013  we have 1130 million of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

dividends 

we paid dividends in 2013  of 1942 million  or 096  per common share compared with 1124 million  or 088  per common share in 2012  and 795 million  or 080  per common share in 2011  at our 2013 annual meeting of shareholders held on april 29 2013 our shareholders approved a proposal to pay quarterly cash dividends through the second quarter of 2014 the authorization provided that dividends of 100  per share be made in quarterly installments of 025  for each of the third and fourth quarters of 2013 and first and second quarters of 2014 and we expect to continue paying dividends on a quarterly basis 

we intend to seek authorization from our shareholders at our 2014 annual general meeting of shareholders to extend the increased dividend or increase the dividend for the remainder of 2014 which will mark the 38 th  consecutive year we have increased dividends 

authorized shares 

our authorized share capital consists of 2130 million  common shares with a par value of 050  swiss francs per share the board of directors is authorized to increase the total share capital until september 14 2014 by a maximum amount of 1065 million  shares in addition our share capital may be increased by 

 share repurchases 

prior to the closing of the merger our board of directors and tyco as our sole shareholder authorized the repurchase of our common shares with a maximum aggregate value of 4000 million  following the closing of the merger this authorization does not have an expiration date in october 2012 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common shares with a maximum aggregate value of 8000 million  this authorization expires on december 31 2015  and is in addition to the 4000 million  share repurchase authorization as of december 31 2013  we had repurchased 196 million  of our common shares for 105 billion  pursuant to these authorizations and had 1500 million  remaining available for repurchases under these authorizations 

in december 2013 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 10 billion  this authorization is in addition to the combined 12 billion prior share repurchase authorization the authorization allows the company to commence share repurchases effective immediately and expires on december 31 2016  no  repurchases were made under this authorization in 2013 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 



the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business for purposes of the above table arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2013  variable interest rate debt was 5289 million  at a weighted average interest rate of 052  

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2013  is estimated to be 608 million  we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes  and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2013  we had recorded 09 million  for the possible payment of penalties and 89 million  related to the possible payment of interest 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income free cash flow is a nongenerally accepted accounting principles financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2013  we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

commitments and contingencies 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2013  there were approximately 2000  lawsuits pending against our subsidiaries a lawsuit might include several claims and we have approximately 2200  claims outstanding as of december 31 2013  this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have been provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2547 million  and 2789 million  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities  in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1196 million  and 1310 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent assets  in the consolidated balance sheets 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned businesses we are responsible or alleged to be responsible for ongoing environmental investigation andor remediation of sites in several countries these sites are in various stages of investigation andor remediation and at some of these sites our liability is considered de minimis we received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from similar state and nonus environmental agencies that several sites formerly or currently owned andor operated by us and other properties or water supplies that may be or may have been impacted from those operations contain disposed or recycled materials or waste and require environmental investigation andor remediation those sites include instances where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal state andor nonus environmental laws and regulations for several formerly owned businesses we have also received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 393 million  and 492 million  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

compliance matters 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the us department of justice “doj” and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj pursuant to which the flow control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the doj concerning its continuing compliance efforts 

standby letters of credit bank guarantees and bonds 

in certain situations tyco guaranteed flow control’s performance to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of flow control in situations where flow control and tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spinoff we will indemnify tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate the potential liability due to the inchoate and unknown nature of these potential liabilities however we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value 

of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs 

as of december 31 2013  and 2012  the outstanding value of bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 4840 million  and 4932 million  respectively 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and longterm business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a six year longterm planning period the six year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated revenues and operating profit beyond 2019  are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate of 30  

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we utilized discount rates ranging from 115  to 125  in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each reporting unit that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop 

multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

impairment charge 

we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2013  and 2012  with each reporting unit’s fair value exceeding its carrying value accordingly step two of the impairment analysis was not required for 2013  or 2012  

in connection with our annual impairment test we determined that the fair value of our australian reporting unit within flow technologies did not exceed its carrying value by a significant amount the percentage of excess fair value over carrying value of this reporting unit was approximately 13 percent for 2013  goodwill for this reporting unit was 3040 million  as of the annual impairment testing date if cash flow projections decreased by 136 or if the discount rate increased by 150 basis points the discount rate used in the impairment analysis was 125 this reporting unit would have failed the step one test and a step two analysis would have been required 

for the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 2005 million  as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test this represented impairment of goodwill in process technologies the impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions and due to continued softness in the endmarkets served by residential water treatment components 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names and trademarks proprietary technology backlog and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization impairment charges of 110 million  and 607 million  were recorded in 2013 and 2012 respectively related to trade names these charges were recorded in impairment of trade names and goodwill  in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss there was no  impairment charge recorded in 2011 for identifiable intangible assets 

the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the impairment charges recorded in 2013 and 2012 were the result of a rebranding strategies implemented in the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012 respectively 

at december 31 2013  our goodwill and intangible assets were 69103 million  and represented 59  of our total assets if we experience future declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet our operating forecasts we may be subject to future impairments additionally changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses increases in the discount rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our businesses or significant declines in our share price or the market as a whole could result in additional impairment indicators because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets during 2013  we recorded impairment charges of 200 million  in conjunction with restructuring activities there were no material impairment charges recorded related to longlived assets in 2012  or 2011  

percentage of completion revenue recognition 

revenue from certain longterm contracts is recognized over the contractual period under the percentage of completion method of accounting under this method sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed either based on the relationship between the actual costs incurred and the total estimated costs at completion “the costtocost method” or based on efforts 

expended for measuring progress towards completion in situations in which this approach is more representative of the progress on the contract than the costtocost method changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed on a regular basis sales and gross profit are adjusted using the cumulative catchup method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values these reviews have not resulted in adjustments that were significant to our results of operations estimated losses are recorded when identified claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor us and nonus definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 12 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 

we recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses for pension and other postretirement benefits annually in the fourth quarter each year marktomarket adjustment and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension and other postretirement plans or when assumptions change as they may each year the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets this accounting method also results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast marktomarket adjustments marktomarket adjustments resulted in pretax income of 632 million  in 2013  and pretax charges of 1462 million  and 662 million  in 2012  and 2011  respectively the remaining components of pension expense primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets are recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds available in the marketplace rated aa or higher adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a weightedaverage discount rate for our us plans of 451  in 2013  367  in 2012  and 505  in 2011  the discount rates on our nonus plans ranged from 050  to 500  in 2013  050  to 450  in 2012  and 075  to 500  in 2011  there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2014  

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets for our us plans was 375  for 2013  750  in 2012  and 800  in 2011  the expected rate of return on our nonus plans ranged from 100  to 650  in 2013  100  to 460  in 2012  and 025  to 520  in 2011  the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices 

during 2012 we adopted an investment strategy for our us pension plans with a primary objective of preserving the funded status of the us plans this is achieved through investments in fixed interest instruments with interest rate sensitivity characteristics closely reflecting the interest rate sensitivity of our benefit obligations the shifting of allocations away from equities to liability hedging fixed income investments by reinvesting in fixed income instruments as equity investments were redeemed was completed during 2013 as of december 31 2013  the us pension plans have an approximately 92 percent  allocation to fixed income investments as a result of the adoption of this investment strategy we anticipate the expected rate of return on our us funded pension plans will continue to be consistent with the discount rate 

see item 8 note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension and other postretirement plans 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

we recognize asbestosrelated liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated certain of these liabilities are subject to insurance coverage our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties the process of estimating asbestosrelated liabilities and the corresponding insurance recoveries receivable is complex and dependent primarily on our historical claim experience estimates of potential future claims our legal strategy for resolving these claims the availability of insurance coverage and the solvency and creditworthiness of insurers 

see item 8 note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding loss contingencies 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2013  was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 79  fixedrate debt and 21  variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2013  a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 991 million  decrease or a 1062 million  increase in fair value respectively 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2013  a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a 52 million  increase in interest incurred a decrease in our interest rates on our variablerate debt of 522 basis points to zero would result in a decrease in interest incurred of 28 million  

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of aoci and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when the hedged item affects net income

information regarding all reportable segments 

backlog of orders by segment 

 

 the valves  controls segment became effective with the merger backlog from this segment consists of business in the energy and industrial verticals generally backlog from the valves  controls segment has a longer manufacturing cycle and products typically ship within six to twelve months of the date on which a customer places an order the increases in water  fluid solutions and technical solutions backlogs resulted primarily from the flow control businesses as a result of the merger backlog from these two segments typically has a shorter manufacturing cycle and products generally ship within 90 days of the date on which a customer places an order a substantial portion of these revenues result from orders received and product delivered in the same month we record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers which represent firm commitments and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract we expect most of our backlog from all segments at december 31 2012 will be filled in 2013 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities these efforts consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2012 2011 and 2010 were 936 million 782 million and 672 million respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider all of the information in this document and the following risk factors before making an investment decision regarding our securities any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this document while we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting us there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in the future 

  

risks relating to our business 

general global economic and business conditions affect demand for our products 

we compete in various geographic regions and product markets around the world among these the most significant are global industrial markets and residential markets many of our businesses have experienced periodic economic downturns important factors for our businesses and the businesses of our customers include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing interest rates and energy and commodity prices while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions any of these factors individually or in the aggregate or a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we compete in attractive markets with a high level of competition which may result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 

the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive we compete against large and wellestablished national and global companies as well as regional and local companies and lower cost manufacturers we compete based on technical expertise reputation for quality and reliability timeliness of delivery previous installation history contractual terms and price some of our competitors in particular smaller companies attempt to compete based primarily on price localized expertise and local relationships especially with respect to products and applications that do not require a great deal of engineering or technical expertise in addition during economic downturns average selling prices tend to decrease as market participants compete more aggressively on price if we are unable to continue to differentiate our products services and solutions or if we are forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

our future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products services and organization to meet the demands of local markets in both developed and emerging economies and by developing or acquiring new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins 

we operate in global markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often global in scope but localized in delivery we compete with thousands of smaller regional and local companies that may be positioned to offer products produced at lower cost than ours or to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate also in several emerging markets potential customers prefer local suppliers in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses accordingly our future success depends upon a number of factors including our ability to adapt our products services organization workforce and sales strategies to fit localities throughout the world particularly in high growth emerging markets identify emerging technological and other trends in our target endmarkets and develop or acquire competitive products and services and bring them to market quickly and costeffectively we have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end markets and geographies but we cannot provide assurance that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets the failure to effectively adapt our products or services could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

our business strategy includes acquiring companies and making investments that complement our existing businesses these acquisitions and investments could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources which could adversely affect our operating results 

we continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition of strategic businesses or product lines with the potential to strengthen our industry position or enhance our existing set of product and services offerings there can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future or that completed acquisitions will be successful acquisitions and investments may involve significant cash expenditures debt incurrence operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows acquisitions involve numerous other risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 it may be difficult for us to complete transactions quickly and to integrate acquired operations efficiently into our business operations any acquisitions or investments may ultimately harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as such acquisitions may not be successful and may ultimately result in impairment charges 

we are exposed to political regulatory economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

the unaudited pro forma combined sales for pentair inc and flow control outside of the united states for the last twelve months ended december 31 2012 accounted for 60 of our net sales and we expect this percentage to be representative of our future sales mix further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from foreign suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the unaudited pro forma combined sales for pentair inc and flow control outside of the united states for the last twelve months ended december 31 2012 accounted for 60 of our net sales and we expect this percentage to be representative of our future sales mix our financial statements reflect translation of items denominated in nonus currencies to us dollars therefore if the us dollar strengthens in relation to the principle nonus currencies from which we derive revenue as compared to a prior period our us dollar reported revenue and income will effectively be decreased to the extent of the change in currency valuations and viceversa changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and in some instances may have a significant effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our future revenue depends in part on the existence of and our ability to win new contracts for major capital projects 

an increasing portion of our revenue in our thermal management and water  environmental systems gbus is derived from major capital projects including water pipeline and desalination projects in water  fluid solutions the number of such projects we may win in any year fluctuates and is dependent upon the general availability of such projects and our ability to bid successfully for them if negative market conditions arise fewer such projects may be available and if we fail to secure adequate financial arrangements or required governmental approvals we may not be able to pursue particular projects either condition could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we maintain a sizable backlog and the timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is uncertain our inability to convert backlog into revenue whether due to factors that are within or outside of our control could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

the timing of our conversion of revenue out of backlog is subject to a variety of factors that may cause delays many of which including fluctuations in our customers’ delivery schedules are beyond our control this is especially true with respect to major global capital projects where the extended timeline for project completion and invoice satisfaction increases the likelihood for delays in the conversion of backlog related to modifications and order cancellations such delays may lead to significant fluctuations in results of operations and cash flows from quarter to quarter making it difficult to predict our financial performance on a quarterly basis further while we believe that historical order cancellations have not been significant if we were to experience a significant amount of cancellations of or reductions in orders it would reduce our backlog and consequently our future sales and results of operations 

material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs we cannot provide assurance however that these actions will be successful in managing our 

  

costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

we are exposed to liquidated damages in many of our customer contracts 

many of our customer contracts contain liquidated damages provisions in the event that we fail to perform our obligations thereunder in a timely manner or in accordance with agreed terms conditions and standards liquidated damages provisions typically provide for a payment to be made by us to the customer if we fail to deliver a product or service on time we generally try to limit our exposure to a maximum penalty within a contract however because our products are often components of large and complex systems or capital projects if we incur liquidated damages they may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain of our products require certifications by regulators or standards organizations and our failure to obtain or maintain such certifications could negatively impact our business 

in certain industries and for certain applications in particular with respect to our pressure relief valves and valves used in the nuclear power generation industry we must obtain certifications for our products or installations by regulators or standards organizations as we expand our products offering into emerging markets we will need to comply with additional and potentially different certification requirements if we fail to obtain required certifications for our products or if we fail to maintain such certifications on our products after they have been certified our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

intellectual property challenges may hinder our ability to develop engineer and market our products 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trademarks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights or register new patents our competitive position could suffer which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets as of december 31 2012 our goodwill and intangible assets were 68042 million and represented 58 of our total assets longterm declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2011 we completed our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment reviews as a result we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 607 million for trade names intangibles and 2005 million for goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2011 respectively these represent impairments of trade names in water  fluid solutions and technical solutions in 2012 the impairment charge was the result of a rebranding strategy implemented in the fourth quarter of 2012 in 2011 the goodwill impairment occurred in water  fluid solutions the impairment charges resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions and due to continued softness in the endmarkets served by residential water treatment components 

  

we may be adversely affected by work stoppages union negotiations labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force 

as of december 31 2012 15000 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils although we believe that our relations with the labor unions and work councils that represent our employees are generally good and we have experienced no material strikes and only minor work stoppages recently no assurances can be made that we will not experience in the future these and other types of conflicts with labor unions works councils other groups representing employees or our employees generally or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within water  fluid solutions and technical solutions in the aquatic systems gbu of water  fluid solutions enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august in the flow technologies gbu of water  fluid solutions demand for residential water supply products and agricultural products follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase in both aquatic systems and flow technologies is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts also in water  fluid solutions our water  environmental systems gbu generally experiences increased demand during australia’s prime agricultural seasons seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns particularly by temperatures heavy flooding and droughts the thermal management gbu in technical solutions generally experiences increased demand for products and services during the fall and winter months in the northern hemisphere we cannot provide assurance that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our share price may fluctuate significantly 

we cannot predict the prices at which our common shares may trade the market price of our common shares may fluctuate widely depending on many factors some of which may be beyond our control including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares 

risks relating to legal regulatory and compliance matters 

our subsidiaries are party to asbestosrelated product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our subsidiaries along with numerous other companies are named as defendants in a substantial number of lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by third parties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants historically our subsidiaries have been identified as defendants in asbestosrelated claims we have experienced an increase in the number of asbestosrelated lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed or withdrawn our strategy has been and continues to be to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and only where appropriate settling claims before trial as of december 31 2012 there were approximately 1900 lawsuits pending against our subsidiaries a lawsuit might include several claims and we have approximately 2300 claims outstanding as of december 31 2012 we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which we will be successful in litigating or otherwise resolving lawsuits in the future and we continue to evaluate different strategies related to asbestos claims filed against us including entity restructuring and judicial relief unfavorable rulings judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we currently record an estimated liability related to pending claims and future claims including related defense costs based on a number of key assumptions and estimation methodologies these assumptions are derived from historical claims experience and reflect our expectations about future claim activities these assumptions about the future may or may not prove accurate and accordingly we may incur additional liabilities in the future a change in one or more of the inputs or the methodology that we use to estimate the asbestos liability could materially change the estimated liability and associated cash flows for pending and future claims although it is possible that we will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond what we have currently recorded we do not believe there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time on a quarterly and annual basis we review and update as appropriate such estimated asbestos liabilities and assets and the underlying assumptions such an update could result in a material change in such estimated assets and liabilities 

we also record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from insurers or other responsible parties for the estimated asbestos liabilities there are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestosrelated recoveries such as policy triggers policy or contract interpretation success in litigation in certain cases the methodology for allocating claims to policies and the continued solvency of the insurers or other responsible parties the assumptions underlying the recorded asset may not prove accurate and as a result actual performance by our insurers and other responsible parties could result in lower receivables and cash flows expected to reduce our asbestos costs we believe it is possible that the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond our estimation period net of expected recoveries could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar anticorruption laws outside the united states 

the fcpa and similar anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business recent years have seen a substantial increase in antibribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the us department of justice “doj” and the us securities and exchange commission “sec” increased 

  

enforcement activity by nonus regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices because many of our customers and end users are involved in infrastructure construction and energy production they are often subject to increased scrutiny by regulators we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or thirdparty intermediaries in the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anticorruption laws including the fcpa we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the fcpa tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj pursuant to which the flow control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the doj concerning its continuing compliance efforts as a result the flow control business may be subject to investigations in other jurisdictions or suffer other criminal or civil penalties or adverse impacts including being subject to lawsuits brought by private litigants each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our failure to satisfy international trade compliance regulations may adversely affect us 

our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis certain of the products we manufacture are “dual use” products which are products that may have both civil and military applications or may otherwise be involved in weapons proliferation and are often subject to more stringent export controls from time to time we obtain or receive information alleging improper activity in connection with imports or exports our policy mandates strict compliance with us and nonus trade laws applicable to our products however even when we are in strict compliance with law and our policies we may suffer reputational damage if certain of our products are sold through various intermediaries to entities operating in sanctioned countries when we receive information alleging improper activity our policy is to investigate that information and respond appropriately including if warranted reporting our findings to relevant governmental authorities nonetheless we cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always protect us from actions that would violate us andor nonus laws any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal penalties including material monetary fines or other adverse actions including denial of import or export privileges and could damage our reputation and business prospects 

legislative action by the us congress could adversely affect us 

legislative action could be taken by the us congress which if ultimately enacted could override tax treaties or modify tax statutes or regulation upon which we rely we cannot predict the outcome of any specific legislative proposals if proposals were enacted that had the effect of disregarding our incorporation in switzerland or limiting our ability as a swiss company to take advantage of the tax treaties between switzerland and the united states we could be subject to increased taxation which could materially adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost 

  

of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require compliance with environmental requirements also could require significant operating or capital expenditures or result in significant operational restrictions we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with environmental and health and safety laws if we violate these laws we could be fined criminally charged or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 

we have been named as defendant target or a potentially responsible party “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses in addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of or exposure to hazardous substances 

certain environmental laws impose liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances we have projects underway at several current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from our past operations or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties the cost of cleanup and other environmental liabilities can be difficult to accurately predict in addition environmental requirements change and tend to become more stringent over time thus we cannot provide assurance that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol and this and other existing international initiatives or those under consideration could affect our international operations to the extent our customers particularly those involved in the oil and gas power generation petrochemical processing or petroleum refining industries are subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations we are exposed to risks that the additional costs by customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at similar levels in certain jurisdictions as historically seen or as currently anticipated which could negatively impact their demand for our products and services in addition new laws and regulations that might favor the increased use of nonfossil fuels including nuclear wind solar and biofuels or that are designed to increase energy efficiency could dampen demand for oil and gas production or power generation resulting in lower spending by customers for our products and services these actions could also increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

our businesses expose us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential or previously existing liabilities in 

  

addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to the distribution and the merger 

we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the merger 

the benefits that are expected to result from the merger will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the merger our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies and the timing of this realization depends on the successful integration of the pentair inc and flow control businesses even if we are able to integrate the pentair inc and flow control businesses successfully this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all for example we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs moreover we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the pentair inc and flow control businesses while we anticipate that certain expenses will be incurred such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates accordingly the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses 

the integration of the pentair inc and flow control businesses following the merger may present significant challenges 

there is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating the pentair inc and flow control businesses these difficulties include 

 

  

  

  

  

 the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of the pentair inc and flow control businesses members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our company service existing customers attract new customers and develop new products or strategies if senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process the pentair inc and flow control businesses could suffer there can be no assurance that we will successfully or costeffectively integrate the pentair inc and flow control businesses the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we share responsibility for certain income tax liabilities for tax periods prior to and including the date of the distribution 

in connection with the distribution we entered into a tax sharing agreement the “2012 tax sharing agreement” with tyco and the adt corporation “adt” which governs the rights and obligations of adt tyco and us for certain predistribution tax liabilities including tyco’s obligations under a separate tax sharing agreement the “2007 tax sharing agreement” entered into by tyco covidien ltd “covidien” and te 

  

connectivity ltd “te connectivity” in connection with the 2007 distributions of covidien and te connectivity by tyco the “2007 separation” the 2012 tax sharing agreement provides that we tyco and adt will share i certain predistribution income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to our tyco’s and adt’s us income tax returns and ii payments required to be made by tyco with respect to the 2007 tax sharing agreement the liabilities in clauses i and ii collectively “shared tax liabilities” tyco is responsible for the first 500 million of shared tax liabilities we and adt will share 42 and 58 respectively of the next 225 million of shared tax liabilities we adt and tyco will share 20 275 and 525 respectively of shared tax liabilities above 725 million 

the 2007 tax sharing agreement governs the rights and obligations of tyco covidien and te connectivity with respect to certain pre2007 separation tax liabilities and certain tax liabilities arising in connection with the 2007 separation more specifically tyco covidien and te connectivity share 27 42 and 31 respectively of income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to tyco’s covidien’s and te connectivity’s us and certain nonus income tax returns and certain taxes attributable to internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the 2007 separation in addition in the event that the 2007 separation or certain related transactions are determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the 2007 separation by tyco covidien or te connectivity the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed on tyco covidien or te connectivity as a result thereof if none of the companies is responsible for such failure then tyco covidien and te connectivity would be responsible for such taxes in the same manner and in the same proportions as other shared tax liabilities under the 2007 tax sharing agreement costs and expenses associated with the management of these shared tax liabilities are generally shared equally among the parties 

with respect to years prior to and including the 2007 separation tax authorities have raised issues and proposed tax adjustments that are generally subject to the sharing provisions of the 2007 tax sharing agreement and which may require tyco to make a payment to a taxing authority covidien or te connectivity with respect to adjustments raised by the irs although tyco has resolved a substantial number of these adjustments a few significant items remain open with respect to the audit of the 1997 through 2004 years as of the date hereof tyco has not been able to resolve certain open items which primarily involve the treatment of certain intercompany debt issued during the period through the irs appeals process as a result tyco expects to litigate these matters once it receives the requisite statutory notices from the irs which is likely to occur within the next six months however the ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and could result in tyco being responsible for a greater amount than it expects under the 2007 tax sharing agreement 

any payment that tyco is required to make under the 2007 tax sharing agreement could result in a material liability for us under the 2012 tax sharing agreement to the extent we are responsible for any liability under the 2012 tax sharing agreement and indirectly the 2007 tax sharing agreement there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations cash flows or our effective tax rate in future reporting periods 

if the merger distribution or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes we our shareholders or tyco could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities 

pentair inc and tyco received private letter rulings from the irs in connection with the distribution and the merger regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the distribution and the merger to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the distribution will qualify as taxfree under sections 355 and 361 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution will qualify for favorable treatment under the code the merger will qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code certain anticipated postclosing transactions will not prevent the taxfree treatment of the distribution or the merger and section 367a1 of the code will not cause the merger to be taxable to pentair inc shareholders except for a us shareholder who is or will be a “fivepercent transferee shareholder” within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations but who does not enter into a “gain recognition agreement with the irs in addition tyco received a legal opinion confirming the taxfree status of the distribution for us federal income tax purposes 

  

and tyco and pentair inc received legal opinions to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization under section 368a of the code and that section 367a1 of the code will not cause the merger to be taxable to pentair inc shareholders except for a us shareholder who is or will be a “fivepercent transferee shareholder” within the meaning of applicable treasury regulations but who does not enter into a “gain recognition agreement” with the irs 

the private letter rulings and opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from us tyco and pentair inc notwithstanding the private letter rulings and the opinions the irs could determine on audit that the distribution the internal transactions or the merger should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution the internal transactions or the merger should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of significant changes in share or asset ownership after the merger 

if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain to tyco shareholders for us federal income tax purposes and tyco shareholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition tyco would recognize a gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common shares distributed to tyco shareholders on the distribution date over tyco’s tax basis in such common shares but such gain if recognized generally would not be subject to us federal income tax however tyco could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities if it is ultimately determined that certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution are taxable if the merger ultimately is determined to be taxable pentair inc shareholders would recognize taxable gain or loss on their disposition of pentair inc common shares in the merger 

under the terms of the 2012 tax sharing agreement in the event the distribution the adt distribution the internal transactions or the merger were determined to be taxable as a result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or tyco the party responsible for such failure would be responsible for all taxes imposed as a result thereof if such failure is not the result of actions taken after the distribution by us adt or tyco then we adt and tyco would be responsible for any taxes imposed as a result of such determination in the same manner and in the same proportions as we adt and tyco are responsible for shared tax liabilities such tax amounts could be significant in the event that any party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement defaults in its obligation to pay certain taxes to another party that arise as a result of no party’s fault each nondefaulting party would be responsible for an equal amount of the defaulting party’s obligation to make a payment to another party in respect of such other party’s taxes in addition if another party to the 2012 tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or a portion of an income tax liability were to default in its payment of such liability to a taxing authority we could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments accordingly under certain circumstances we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our agreedupon share of our tyco’s and adt’s tax liabilities 

if the distribution or the merger are determined to be taxable for swiss withholding or other tax purposes we could incur significant swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities 

generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to tyco’s shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder as of january 1 2011 distributions to shareholders out of qualifying contributed surplus  kapitaleinlage  accumulated on or after january 1 1997 are exempt from swiss withholding tax if certain conditions are met  kapitaleinlageprinzip  tyco has obtained a ruling from the swiss federal tax administration confirming that the distribution qualifies as payment out of such qualifying contributed surplus and no amount will be withheld by tyco when making the distribution 

as a condition to closing of the merger tyco obtained rulings from the swiss federal tax administration confirming i that the merger will be a transaction that is generally taxfree for swiss federal cantonal and communal tax purposes including with respect to swiss stamp tax and swiss withholding tax ii the relevant swiss tax base of an acquisition subsidiary of ours for swiss tax including federal and cantonal and communal purposes iii the relevant amount of capital contribution reserves  kapitaleinlageprinzip  which will be exempt 

  

from swiss withholding tax in the event of a distribution to our shareholders after the merger and iv that no swiss stamp tax will be levied on certain postmerger restructuring transactions 

these tax rulings rely on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations and undertakings from tyco notwithstanding these tax rulings the swiss federal tax administration could determine on audit that the distribution or the merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for withholding tax or other tax purposes if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated if the distribution or the merger or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the distribution ultimately are determined to be taxable for withholding tax or other tax purposes we and tyco could incur material swiss withholding tax or other tax liabilities that could significantly detract from or eliminate the benefits of the distribution and the merger in addition we could become liable to indemnify tyco for part of any swiss withholding tax liabilities to the extent provided under the 2012 tax sharing agreement 

we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions 

our ability to engage in desirable strategic transactions or equity issuances could be significantly limited or restricted in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distribution and certain related transactions even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporatelevel gain to tyco under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of our shares or tyco’s shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution any acquisitions or issuances of our shares or tyco’s shares within two years after the distribution are generally presumed to be part of such a plan although we or tyco may be able to rebut that presumption for purposes of this test the merger might be treated as part of such a plan or series of related transactions but if so would not by itself cause the distribution to be taxable to tyco since pentair inc shareholders acquired less than 50 of our common shares in the merger the change in ownership resulting from the merger if treated as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution would be aggregated with other acquisitions or issuances of our shares that occur as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution in determining whether a 50 change in ownership has occurred the process for determining whether a change of ownership has occurred under the tax rules is complex inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case if we do not carefully monitor our compliance with these rules we could inadvertently cause or permit a change of ownership to occur triggering our obligation to indemnify tyco or adt pursuant to the 2012 tax sharing agreement 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to tyco of the distribution under the 2012 tax sharing agreement we are prohibited from taking or failing to take any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being taxfree further for the twoyear period following the distribution without obtaining the consent of tyco and adt a private letter ruling from the irs or an unqualified opinion of a nationally recognized law firm we may be prohibited from among other things 

 

  

  

  

 these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business moreover the 2012 tax sharing agreement also 

  

provides that we are responsible for any taxes imposed on tyco or any of its affiliates or on adt or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the distribution by or in respect of us any of our affiliates or our shareholders 

our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to quickly integrate and update the financial reporting systems of the flow control business 

the financial results of the flow control business previously were included within the consolidated results of tyco and were not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” as a result of the distribution and the merger we are subject to reporting and other obligations under the exchange act the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition we are responsible for ensuring that all aspects of our business comply with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and a report by an independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments although our management has experience with these reporting and related obligations ensuring compliance with respect to the flow control business may place significant demands on management administrative and operational resources including accounting systems and resources 

our report on our internal control over financial reporting “icfr” in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2012 includes a scope exception for the acquired flow control business because it is a significant acquisition for which our management would otherwise have had only three months to evaluate and implement icfr 

under the sarbanesoxley act we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting to comply with these requirements with respect to the flow control business we may need to upgrade our systems implement additional financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures and hire additional accounting and finance staff it is expected that we will incur annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements and those expenses may be significant if we are unable to upgrade its financial and management controls reporting systems information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the exchange act could be impaired any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our liquidity 

disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect us our customers and our suppliers by increasing funding costs or reducing availability of credit 

in the normal course of our business we may access credit markets for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of indebtedness acquisitions additions to working capital repurchase of common shares capital expenditures and investments in our subsidiaries although we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our foreseeable needs our access to and the cost of capital could be negatively impacted by disruptions in the credit markets which have occurred in the past and made financing terms for borrowers unattractive or unavailable these factors may make it more difficult or expensive for us to access credit markets if the need arises in addition these factors may make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet demand for their products or for prospective customers to commence new projects as customers and suppliers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing disruptions in the financial markets have had adverse effects on other areas of the economy and have led to a slowdown in general economic activity that may continue to adversely affect our businesses these disruptions may have other unknown adverse effects one or more of these factors could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

  

covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect us 

our credit agreements and indentures contain customary financial covenants our ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot provide assurance that we will meet those tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements or indentures upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our credit facilities or indentures the lenders or trustees could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and in the case of credit facility lenders terminate all commitments to extend further credit if the lenders or trustees accelerate the repayment of borrowings we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our credit facilities and our other indebtedness furthermore acceleration of any obligation under any of our material debt instruments will permit the holders of our other material debt to accelerate their obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future which could affect our financial condition and may decrease our profitability 

as of december 31 2012 we had 25 billion of total debt outstanding we may increase our debt or raise additional capital in the future subject to restrictions in our debt agreements if our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate or if our cash requirements are more than we expect we may require more financing however debt or equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms if at all if we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of additional capital shares the terms of the debt or capital shares issued may give the holders rights preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common shares particularly in the event of liquidation the terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity the percentage ownership of existing shareholders in our company would decline if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed our financial condition could be adversely affected also regardless of the terms of our financings the amount of our shares that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our shares may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for tyco under section 355e of the code and under the 2012 tax sharing agreement we could be required to indemnify tyco for that tax see discussion under “we might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the distribution and the merger because of restrictions relating to us federal income tax requirements for taxfree distributions” 

our leverage could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including our existing debt as well as any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions including i reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or ii dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt 

risks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporation in switzerland 

our status as a swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management and may cause us to be unable to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding tax 

swiss law allows shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without additional shareholder approval this authorization is limited to 50 of the existing registered share capital and must be renewed by the shareholders every two years additionally subject to specified exceptions swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe to any new issuance of shares swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of 

  

some other jurisdictions swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 

under swiss law a swiss corporation may pay dividends only if the corporation has sufficient distributable profits from previous fiscal years or if the corporation has distributable reserves each as evidenced by its audited statutory balance sheet distributable reserves are generally recorded either as “free reserves” or as “qualifying contributed surplus” contributions received from shareholders in “capital contribution reserve” distributions may be made out of registered share capital—the aggregate par value of a company’s registered shares—only by way of a capital reduction after the merger the amount available for future dividends or capital reductions from reserve from capital contributions on a swiss withholding tax free basis is chf 87 billion we are awaiting approval from the swiss tax authorities of the reserve from capital contributions we will not be able to pay dividends or make other distributions to shareholders on a swiss withholding tax free basis in excess of that amount unless we increase our share capital or our reserves from capital contributions we would also be able to pay dividends out of distributable profits or freely distributable reserves but such dividends would be subject to swiss withholding tax there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient distributable profits free reserves reserves from capital contributions or registered share capital to pay a dividend or effect a capital reduction or that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for dividend payments or distributions as a result of capital reductions 

generally swiss withholding tax of 35 is due on dividends and similar distributions to our shareholders regardless of the place of residency of the shareholder unless the distribution is made to shareholders out of i a reduction of par value or ii assuming certain conditions are met qualifying contributed surplus accumulated on or after january 1 1997 a us holder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income the “usswiss treaty” may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 treaty rate or in excess of the 5 reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least 10 participation in our voting shares or for a full refund in the case of qualified pension funds there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient qualifying contributed surplus to pay dividends free from swiss withholding tax or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future in addition there can be no assurance that the current swiss law with respect to distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus will not be changed or that a change in swiss law will not adversely affect us or our shareholders in particular as a result of distributions out of qualifying contributed surplus becoming subject to additional corporate law or other restrictions there are currently motions pending in the swiss parliament that purport to limit the distribution of qualifying contributed surplus in addition over the long term the amount of par value available to us for par value reductions or qualifying contributed surplus available to us to pay out as distributions is limited if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or out of qualifying contributed surplus we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 

under present swiss tax laws repurchases of shares for the purposes of cancellation are treated as a partial liquidation subject to 35 swiss withholding tax on the difference between the repurchase price and the par value except since january 1 2011 to the extent attributable to qualifying contributed surplus  kapitaleinlagereserven  if any if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves the swiss withholding tax becomes due no partial liquidation treatment applies and no withholding tax is triggered if the shares are not repurchased for cancellation but held by us as treasury shares however should we not resell such treasury shares within six years the withholding tax becomes due at the end of the six year period 

although we may follow a share repurchase process for future share repurchases if any similar to a “second trading line” on the six swiss exchange in which swiss institutional investors sell shares to us and are generally able to receive a refund of the swiss withholding tax if we are unable to use this process successfully we may 

  

not be able to repurchase shares for the purposes of capital reduction without triggering swiss withholding tax if and to the extent that the repurchase of shares is made out of retained earnings or other taxable reserves no withholding tax would be applicable if and to the extent that taxfree qualifying contributed surplus is attributable to the share repurchase 

changes in the us dollarswiss franc exchange rate could limit the amount of dividends authorized on our common shares and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to pay dividends on our common shares 

prior to the consummation of the merger our board of directors proposed and tyco as our sole shareholder authorized us to pay quarterly cash dividends through the first annual general meeting of our shareholders in 2013 the authorization provides that a dividend will be made out of our “contributed surplus” equity position in our statutory accounts to our shareholders in the amount of 023 for the second quarter of 2013 the deduction to our contributed surplus in our statutory accounts which is required to be made in swiss francs will be determined based on the aggregate amount of the dividend and will be calculated based on the us dollarswiss franc exchange rate in effect on september 14 2012 the us dollar amount of the dividend will be capped at an amount such that the aggregate reduction to our contributed surplus will not exceed 240 million swiss francs to the extent that a dividend payment would exceed the cap the us dollar per share amount of the current or future dividends will be reduced on a pro rata basis so that the aggregate amount of all dividends paid does not exceed the cap in addition the aggregate reduction in contributed surplus will be increased for any shares issued and decreased for any shares acquired after september 14 2012 and before the record date for the applicable dividend payment 

any future dividends that may be proposed by our board of directors will be subject to approval by our shareholders at our annual general meeting there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve dividends whether our board of directors exercises its discretion to propose any dividends to holders of our common shares will depend on many factors including our financial condition earnings capital requirements of our business covenants associated with debt obligations legal requirements regulatory constraints industry practice and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay any dividend in the future 

swiss laws differ from the laws in effect in the united states and may afford less protection to holders of our securities 

because of differences between swiss law and us state and federal laws and differences between the governing documents of swiss companies and those incorporated in the us it may not be possible to enforce in switzerland court judgments obtained in the united states against us based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the united states as a result in a lawsuit based on the civil liability provisions of the us federal or state securities laws us investors may find it difficult to 

 

  

  

 original actions against persons in switzerland based solely upon the us federal or state securities laws are governed among other things by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on private international law this statute provides that the application of provisions of nonswiss law by the courts in switzerland shall be precluded if the result was incompatible with swiss public policy also mandatory provisions of swiss law may be applicable regardless of any other law that would otherwise apply 

  

switzerland and the united states do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition of and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters the recognition and enforcement of a judgment of the courts of the united states in switzerland is governed by the principles set forth in the swiss federal act on private international law this statute provides in principle that a judgment rendered by a nonswiss court may be enforced in switzerland only if

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities 

  

and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2012 there were approximately 1900 lawsuits pending against our subsidiaries a lawsuit might include several claims and we have approximately 2300 claims outstanding as of december 31 2012 this amount is not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2346 million and 06 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1574 million at december 31 2012 all of which was acquired in the merger and was recorded in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets we had no estimated receivable for insurance recoveries as of december 31 2011 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned businesses we are responsible or alleged to be responsible for ongoing environmental investigation andor remediation of sites in several countries these sites are in various stages of investigation andor remediation and at some of these sites our liability is considered de minimis we received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from similar state and nonus environmental agencies that several sites formerly or currently owned andor operated by us and other properties or water supplies that may be or may have been impacted from those operations contain disposed or recycled materials or waste and require environmental investigation andor remediation those sites include instances where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal state andor nonus environmental laws and regulations for several formerly owned businesses we have also received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 359 million and 15 million as of december 31 

  

2012 and 2011 respectively we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

compliance matters 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the doj and the sec related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj pursuant to which the flow control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the doj concerning its continuing compliance efforts

by virtue of our market capitalization we are a component of the sp 500 index prior to the merger we used the sp midcap 400 index as a comparison because we had not found a readily identifiable peer group and using a published industry index would have skewed results by including significantly larger companies after the merger on the basis of our size and diversity of businesses we believe the sp 500 industrials index is an appropriate published industry index for comparison purposes

overview 

pentair ltd formerly known as tyco flow control international ltd as used prior to the merger as defined below “flow control” is a company organized under the laws of switzerland the terms “us “we” or “our” refer to pentair ltd and its consolidated subsidiaries our business took its current form on september 28 2012 as a result of a spinoff of flow control from its parent tyco international ltd “tyco” and a reverse acquisition involving pentair inc 

prior to the spinoff tyco engaged in an internal restructuring whereby it transferred to flow control certain assets related to the flow control business of tyco and flow control assumed from tyco certain liabilities related to the flow control business of tyco on september 28 2012 prior to the merger as defined below tyco effected a spinoff of flow control through the prorata distribution of 100 of the outstanding common shares of flow control to tyco’s shareholders the “distribution” resulting in the distribution of 110898934 of our common shares to tyco’s shareholders immediately following the distribution an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of ours merged with and into pentair inc with pentair inc surviving as an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of ours the “merger” at the effective time of the merger each pentair inc common share was converted into the right to receive one of our common shares resulting in 99388463 of our common shares being issued to pentair inc shareholders the merger is intended to be taxfree for us federal income tax purposes after the merger our common shares are traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol pnr tyco equitybased awards held by flow control employees and certain tyco employees and directors outstanding prior to the completion of the distribution were converted in connection with the distribution into equitybased awards with respect to our common shares and were assumed by us pentair inc equitybased awards outstanding prior to the completion of the merger were converted upon completion of the merger into equitybased awards with respect to our common shares and were assumed by us the total purchase price for flow control was 49 billion consisting of 48 billion of common shares issued to tyco shareholders 05 million of cash paid to tyco shareholders in lieu of fractional shares and 923 million in replacement equitybased awards to holders of tyco equitybased awards the merger is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with pentair inc treated as the acquirer 

  

following the merger we are a diversified industrial manufacturing company comprising three reporting segments water  fluid solutions valves  controls and technical solutions we classify our continuing operations into business segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets served 

 

  

  

 in 2012 water  fluid solutions and technical solutions accounted for 70 percent and 30 percent of total revenues through the first nine months of the year respectively water  fluid solutions valves  controls and technical solutions accounted for 44 percent 31 percent and 25 percent of total revenues during the fourth quarter of the year respectively reflecting our postmerger revenue mix 

in may 2011 pentair inc acquired as part of the water  fluid solutions reporting segment the clean process technologies “cpt” division of privately held norit holding bv for 7153 million €5027 million translated at the may 12 2011 exchange rate cpt’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition cpt is a global leader in membrane solutions and clean process technologies in the high growth water and beverage filtration and separation segments 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2011 we completed our annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment reviews as a result we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 607 million for trade name intangibles and 2005 million for goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2012 and 2011 respectively these represent impairments of trade names across several of our reporting units in water  fluid solutions and technical solutions in 2012 the impairment charges resulted from a rebranding strategy implemented in the fourth quarter of 2012 in 2011 the goodwill impairment occurred in water  fluid solutions the impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions and continued softness in the endmarkets served by residential water treatment components 

key trends and uncertainties regarding our existing business 

our net sales for 2012 were 44 billion and were composed of sales in our reporting segments as follows water  fluid solutions – 26 billion valves  controls – 06 billion and technical solutions – 12 billion 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2012 and 2011 and will likely impact our results in the future 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2013 our operating objectives include the following

in october 2012 we redeemed the remaining outstanding aggregate principal of our 565 fixed rate senior notes due 20132017 totaling 400 million and our 105 floating rate senior notes due 2013 totaling 100 million the “fixedfloating rate notes” the redemptions included makewhole premiums of 658 million concurrent with the redemption of the fixedfloating rate notes we terminated a related interest rate swap that was designated as a cash flow hedge which resulted in the reclassification of 34 million of previously 

  

unrecognized variable to fixed swap losses from accumulated other comprehensive income loss “aoci” to earnings in october 2012 all costs associated with the redemption were recorded as a loss on the early extinguishment of debt including 06 million of unamortized deferred financing costs 

in december 2012 pentair finance sa “pfsa” completed an exchange offer pursuant to which it exchanged 373 million in aggregate principal amount of 500 senior notes due 2021 of pentair inc a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of the company for a like amount of new 500 senior notes due 2021 of pfsa plus 56 million in transactionrelated costs which were recorded as a loss on the early extinguishment of debt

 liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings we have grown our businesses in significant part in the past through acquisitions financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time by private or public debt issuance our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions we intend to issue commercial paper to fund our financing needs on a shortterm basis and to use our revolving credit facility as backup liquidity to support commercial paper 

  

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within water  fluid solutions we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 680 million in 2012 or 2522 million lower than in 2011 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to accelerated contributions of pension and other postretirement obligations 

cash provided by operating activities was 3202 million in 2011 or 498 million higher than in 2010 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net income before noncash items partially offset by increased working capital necessary to support revenue growth 

investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities was 3756 million in 2012 net cash used in investing activities was 8081 million and 603 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively 

acquisitions

in october 2012 we acquired as part of valves  controls the remaining 25 equity interest in pentair middle east holding sarl “kef” for 100 million in cash 

additionally during 2012 we completed other small acquisitions in water  fluid solutions with purchase prices totaling 1212 million in cash net of cash acquired 

in may 2011 we acquired as part of water  fluid solutions the cpt division of privately held norit holdings for 7153 million 

additionally during 2011 we completed other small acquisitions in water  fluid solutions with purchase prices totaling 216 million consisting of 178 million in cash and 38 million as notes payable 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures in 2012 2011 and 2010 were 945 million 733 million and 595 million respectively the increase in capital expenditures in 2012 from 2011 is primarily due to the merger we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 to be approximately 180 to 200 million primarily for capacity expansions of manufacturing facilities located in our lowcost countries developing new products and general maintenance 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 2323 million in 2012 net cash provided by financing activities was 5036 million in 2011 net cash used for financing activities was 1906 million in 2010 cash used for financing activities in 2012 included payments of dividends early debt termination fees and share repurchases partially offset by net borrowings of longterm debt cash provided by financing activities in 2011 primarily relates to borrowings used to fund the cpt acquisition in may 2011 partially offset by repayments of longterm 

  

debt dividend payments and share repurchases additionally financing activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business payments of dividends cash receivedused for shares issued to employees repurchase of common shares and tax benefits related to sharebased compensation 

in december 2012 our whollyowned subsidiary pentair finance sa “pfsa” completed an exchange offer the “exchange offer” pursuant to which it exchanged 373 million in aggregate principal amount of 500 senior notes due 2021 of pentair inc a whollyowned indirect subsidiary of the company the “2021 notes” for a like amount of new 500 senior notes due 2021 of pfsa the “new 2021 notes” plus 56 million in transactionrelated costs upon completion of the exchange offer 127 million in aggregate principal amount of 2021 notes remained outstanding the remaining 2021 notes and new 2021 notes are guaranteed as to payment by pentair ltd

in september 2012 pentair inc entered into a credit agreement providing for an unsecured committed revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with initial maximum aggregate availability of up to 1450 million the credit facility replaced pentair inc’s 700 million former credit facility as defined below the credit facility matures in september 2017 upon the completion of the merger pentair ltd became the guarantor under the credit facility and pfsa and certain other of our subsidiaries became affiliate borrowers under the credit facility borrowings under the credit facility generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a specified margin based upon pfsa’s credit ratings pfsa must also pay a facility fee ranging from 100 to 300 basis points per annum based upon pfsa’s credit ratings on the amount of each lender’s commitment 

in may 2011 pentair inc completed a public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of the 2021 notes pentair inc used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2021 notes to finance in part the cpt acquisition in 2011 the 2021 notes which remain outstanding subsequent to the exchange offer are guaranteed as to payment by pentair ltd 

in april 2011 pentair inc entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement that provided for an unsecured committed revolving credit facility the “former credit facility” of up to 700 million with multi 

  

currency subfacilities to support investments outside the us borrowings under the former credit facility bore interest at the rate of libor plus 175 we used borrowings under the former credit facility to fund a portion of the cpt acquisition in 2011 and to repay 105 million of matured senior notes in may 2012 the former credit facility was terminated in september 2012 in connection with the merger and replaced by the credit facility at which time the subsidiary guarantees in place under the former credit facility ceased to exist 

pfsa is authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility pfsa uses the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had 4247 million and 35 million respectively of commercial paper outstanding all of which was classified as longterm as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility 

we used borrowings under the credit facility and proceeds from the 20172022 notes offering to repay the former credit facility and to pay other fees and expenses in connection with the merger total availability under the credit facility was 10253 million as of december 31 2012 which was not limited by any covenants contained in the credit facility’s credit agreement subsequent to the merger we used the remaining proceeds from the 20172022 notes offering and issuances of commercial paper to redeem the fixedfloating rate notes as discussed above to repurchase shares in conjunction with our share repurchase as discussed in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and to purchase the remaining 25 interest in kef for 100 million as discussed in item 8 note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants the most restrictive of which are in the credit facility including that we may not permit i the ratio of our consolidated debt plus synthetic lease obligations to our consolidated net income excluding among other things noncash gains and losses before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash sharebased compensation expense and up to 40 million of costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger “ebitda” for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended the “leverage ratio” to exceed 350 to 100 on the last day of each fiscal quarter and ii the ratio of our ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ended to our consolidated interest expense including consolidated yield or discount accrued as to outstanding securitization obligations if any for the same period to be less than 300 to 100 as of the end of each fiscal quarter for purposes of the leverage ratio the credit facility provides for the calculation of ebitda giving pro forma effect to the merger and certain acquisitions divestitures and liquidations during the period to which such calculation relates as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements 

in addition to the credit facility we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of 890 million of which 30 million was outstanding at december 31 2012 borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates additionally as part of the merger and cpt acquisition we assumed certain capital leases with an outstanding balance of 238 million and 158 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

as of december 31 2012 we have 1435 million of cash held in certain countries in which the ability to repatriate is limited due to local regulations or significant potential tax consequences 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders quarterly we believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

we paid dividends in 2012 of 1124 million or 088 per common share compared with 795 million or 080 per common share in 2011 and 755 million or 076 per common share in 2010 prior to the completion of the merger our board of directors proposed and tyco as our sole shareholder authorized us to pay cash dividends of 023 per share on february 8 2013 to shareholders of record on january 25 2013 and 023 per share on 

  

may 10 2013 to shareholders of record on april 26 2013 and we expect to continue paying dividends on a quarterly basis we intend to seek authorization from our shareholders at our 2013 annual general meeting of shareholders to extend the increased dividend or increase the dividend for the remainder of 2013 which will mark the 37 th consecutive year we have increased dividends 

authorized shares 

our authorized share capital consists of 2130 million common shares with a par value of chf 050 per share our board of directors is authorized to increase the total share capital until september 14 2014 by a maximum amount of 1065 million shares in addition our share capital may be increased by 

 

  

 share repurchases 

prior to the closing of the merger our board of directors and tyco as our sole shareholder authorized the repurchase of our common shares with a maximum aggregate value of 4000 million following the closing of the merger this authorization does not have an expiration date on october 1 2012 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of our common shares with a maximum aggregate value of 8000 million this authorization expires on december 31 2015 and is in addition to the 4000 million share repurchase authorization under these authorizations we repurchased 7291078 of our common shares in 2012 for 3342 million 

contractual obligations 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

 

 the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw materials to be utilized in the normal course of business for purposes of the above table arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2012 variable interest rate debt was 428 million at a weighted average interest rate of 067 

  

the estimated annual pension plan contribution amounts are intended to achieve fully funded status of our domestic qualified pension plan in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 pension and other postretirement plan contributions are based on an assumed us pension plan discount rate and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 375 for all periods 

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2012 is estimated to be 545 million we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2012 we had recorded 31 million for the possible payment of penalties and 195 million related to the possible payment of interest 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income from continuing operations free cash flow is a nongenerally accepted accounting principles financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2012 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

commitments and contingencies 

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability asbestos environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in item 8 note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements could change in the future 

asbestos matters 

our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos 

  

or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties each case typically names between dozens to hundreds of corporate defendants while we have observed an increase in the number of these lawsuits over the past several years including lawsuits by plaintiffs with mesotheliomarelated claims a large percentage of these suits have not presented viable legal claims and as a result have been dismissed by the courts our historical strategy has been to mount a vigorous defense aimed at having unsubstantiated suits dismissed and where appropriate settling suits before trial although a large percentage of litigated suits have been dismissed we cannot predict the extent to which we will be successful in resolving lawsuits in the future 

as of december 31 2012 there were approximately 1900 lawsuits pending against our subsidiaries a lawsuit might include several claims and we have approximately 2300 claims outstanding as of december 31 2012 this amount was not adjusted for claims that are not actively being prosecuted identified incorrect defendants or duplicated other actions which would ultimately reflect our current estimate of the number of viable claims made against us our affiliates or entities for which we assumed responsibility in connection with acquisitions or divestitures in addition the amount does not include certain claims pending against third parties for which we have provided an indemnification 

our estimated liability for asbestosrelated claims was 2346 million and 06 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and was recorded in other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for pending and future claims and related defense costs our estimated receivable for insurance recoveries was 1574 million at december 31 2012 all of which was acquired in the merger and was recorded in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets we had no estimated receivable for insurance recoveries as of december 31 2011 

environmental matters 

we are involved in or have retained responsibility and potential liability for environmental obligations and legal proceedings related to our current business and including pursuant to certain indemnification obligations related to certain formerly owned businesses we are responsible or alleged to be responsible for ongoing environmental investigation andor remediation of sites in several countries these sites are in various stages of investigation andor remediation and at some of these sites our liability is considered de minimis we received notification from the us environmental protection agency and from similar state and nonus environmental agencies that several sites formerly or currently owned andor operated by us and other properties or water supplies that may be or may have been impacted from those operations contain disposed or recycled materials or waste and require environmental investigation andor remediation those sites include instances where we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under us federal state andor nonus environmental laws and regulations for several formerly owned businesses we have also received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses 

our accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a sitebysite basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies it can be difficult to estimate reliably the final costs of investigation and remediation due to various factors in our opinion the amounts accrued are appropriate based on facts and circumstances as currently known based upon our experience current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws we have recorded reserves for these environmental matters of 359 million and 15 million as of december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively we do not anticipate these environmental conditions will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows however unknown conditions new details about existing conditions or changes in environmental requirements may give rise to environmental liabilities that will exceed the amount of our current reserves and could have a material adverse effect in the future 

  

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

compliance matters 

prior to the merger the flow control business was subject to investigations by the us department of justice “doj” and the us securities and exchange commission “sec” related to allegations that improper payments were made by the flow control business and other tyco subsidiaries and thirdparty intermediaries in recent years in violation of the foreign corrupt practices act tyco reported to the doj and the sec the remedial measures that it had taken in response to the allegations and tyco’s own internal investigations as a result of discussions with the doj and sec aimed at resolving these matters on september 24 2012 tyco entered into a settlement with the sec and a nonprosecution agreement with the doj pursuant to which the flow control business is for a three year period subject to yearly reporting to the doj concerning its continuing compliance efforts 

standby letters of credit bank guarantees and bonds 

in certain situations tyco guaranteed flow control’s performance to third parties or provided financial guarantees for financial commitments of flow control in situations where flow control and tyco were unable to obtain a release from these guarantees in connection with the spinoff we will indemnify tyco for any losses it suffers as a result of such guarantees 

in disposing of assets or businesses we often provide representations warranties and indemnities to cover various risks including unknown damage to the assets environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition we do not have the ability to reasonably estimate the potential liability due to the inchoate and unknown nature of these potential liabilities however we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of these instruments fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs 

as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the outstanding value of bonds letters of credit and bank guarantees totaled 4932 million and 1362 million respectively 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

  

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and longterm business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a five year longterm planning period the five year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated revenues and operating profit beyond 2019 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate of 30 

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we utilized a discount rate ranging from 120 to 130 in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each reporting segment that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of earnings 

  

before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

impairment charge 

we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter for 2012 with each reporting unit’s fair value exceeding its carrying value accordingly step two of the impairment analysis was not required for 2012 

for the year ended december 31 2011 we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 2005 million as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test this represented impairment of goodwill in water  fluid solutions the impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions prevailing in these markets and due to continued softness in the endmarkets served by residential water treatment components 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships trade names and trademarks proprietary technology backlog and patents identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization an impairment charge of 607 million was recorded in 2012 related to trade names these charges were recorded in impairment of trade names and goodwill in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss there was no impairment charge recorded in 2011 or 2010 for identifiable intangible assets 

the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the impairment charge recorded in 2012 was the result of a rebranding strategy implemented in the fourth quarter of 2012 

at december 31 2012 our goodwill and intangible assets were 68042 million and represented 58 of our total assets if we experience future declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet our operating forecasts we may be subject to future impairments additionally changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses increases in the discount rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our businesses or significant declines in our share price or the market as a whole could result in additional impairment indicators because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets there were no material impairment charges recorded related to longlived assets in 2012 2011 or 2010 

  

percentage of completion revenue recognition 

revenue from certain longterm contracts is recognized over the contractual period under the percentage of completion “poc” method of accounting under this method sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed either based on the relationship between the actual costs incurred and the total estimated costs at completion “the costtocost method” or based on efforts expended for measuring progress towards completion in situations in which this approach is more representative of the progress on the contract than the costtocost method changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed on a regular basis sales and gross profit are adjusted using the cumulative catchup method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values these reviews have not resulted in adjustments that were significant to our results of operations estimated losses are recorded when identified claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement 

pension and other postretirement plans 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 14 to the notes to consolidated financial statements differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense the primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are 1 changes in the discount rate used to value pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date and 2 differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of bonds available in the marketplace rated aa or higher adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a discount rate for our us plans of 367 in 2012 505 in 2011 and 590 in 2010 the discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 050 to 450 in 2012 075 to 500 in 2011 and 075 to 540 in 2010 there are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2013 

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets for our us plans was 75 for 2012 and 80 in 2011 and 85 in 2010 the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices the expected rate of return on our non us plans ranged from 10 to 46 in 2012 025 to 520 in 2011 and 15 to 55 in 2010 

during 2012 we adopted an investment strategy for our us pension plans with a primary objective of preserving the funded status of the us plans this is achieved through investments in fixed interest instruments with interest rate sensitivity characteristics closely reflecting the interest rate sensitivity of our benefit obligations shifting of allocations away from equities to liability hedging fixed income investments is currently in progress as equity investments are redeemed proceeds are reinvested in fixed income instruments after we have completed the transition the us pension plans will have in excess of 90 percent allocation to fixed income investments as a result of the adoption of this investment strategy we will be decreasing our expected return on assets for our funded us pension plans to 375 in 2013 based on expectations of future market returns and the asset mix of the plans’ investments 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we changed our method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for pension and other postretirement benefits for all of our benefit plans historically we have recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and have amortized them 

  

into our operating results over the average future service period of the active employees of these plans to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a corridor we have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in our operating results on the basis that it is preferable to accelerate the recognition of deferred gains and losses into income rather than to delay such recognition additionally for purposes of calculating the expected return on plan assets we will no longer use a calculated value for the marketrelated value of plan assets but instead will use the actual fair value of our plan assets these changes will improve transparency in our operating results by more quickly recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate conditions on plan obligations investments and assumptions 

under our new accounting method we will recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses annually in the fourth quarter each year the remaining components of pension expense primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets will be recorded on a quarterly basis as ongoing pension expense we have applied this change retrospectively adjusting all prior periods see item 8 note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a presentation of our operating results before and after the application of this accounting change 

see item 8 note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 

loss contingencies 

accruals are recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings selfinsurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business the accruals are based on judgment the probability of losses and where applicable the consideration of opinions of internal andor external legal counsel and actuarially determined estimates additionally we record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be probable 

we recognize asbestosrelated liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated certain of these liabilities are subject to insurance coverage our subsidiaries and numerous other companies are named as defendants in personal injury lawsuits based on alleged exposure to asbestoscontaining materials these cases typically involve product liability claims based primarily on allegations of manufacture sale or distribution of industrial products that either contained asbestos or were attached to or used with asbestoscontaining components manufactured by thirdparties the process of estimating asbestosrelated liabilities and the corresponding insurance recoveries receivable is complex and dependent primarily on our historical claim experience estimates of potential future claims our legal strategy for resolving these claims the availability of insurance coverage and the solvency and creditworthiness of insurers 

see item 8 note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding loss contingencies 

income taxes 

in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income in estimating future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future pretax operating income the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 

we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized our 

  

income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction any reduction in future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 

changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations we perform reviews of our income tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrue for uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards as events change or resolution occurs these liabilities are adjusted such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment an additional charge to expense would result if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio as of december 31 2012 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 83 fixedrate debt and 17 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2012 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 1204 million decrease or a 1301 million increase in fair value 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2012 a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a 42 million increase in interest incurred a decrease in our interest rates on our variablerate debt of 664 basis points to zero would result in a decrease in interest incurred of 28 million 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar periodically we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating 

  

locations are the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar 

from time to time we may enter into short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks as the majority of our foreign currency contracts have an original maturity date of less than one year there is no material foreign currency risk changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows gains and losses related to a hedge are deferred and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of aoci and subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when the hedged item affects net income

seasonality 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within water  fluid solutions enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

competition 

water  fluid solutions faces numerous domestic and international competitors some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the markets in which we compete consolidation and globalization are continuing trends in the water industry competition in commercial and residential flow technologies markets focuses on brand names product performance including energyefficient offerings quality and price while home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps they are not important for commercial pumps for municipal pumps competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications service and price competition in fluid treatment filtration and processing focuses on product performance and design quality delivery and price for pool equipment competition focuses on brand names product performance including energyefficient offerings quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing market penetration

competition 

competition in the technical products markets can be intense particularly in the communications market where product design prototyping global supply price competition and customer service are significant factors technical products has continued to focus on cost control and improving profitability recent sales increases in technical products are the result of growth from initiatives focused on product development continued channel penetration growth in targeted market segments geographic expansion and price increases consolidation globalization and outsourcing are visible trends in the technical products marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier we believe technical products has the global manufacturing capability and broad product portfolio to support the globalization and outsourcing trends 

recent developments 

on may 12 2011 we acquired as part of water  fluid solutions the clean process technologies “cpt division of privately held norit holding bv for 7153 million €5027 million translated at the may 12 2011 exchange rate cpt’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition cpt is a global leader in membrane solutions and clean process technologies in the high growth water and beverage filtration and separation segments cpt provides sustainable purification systems and solutions for desalination water reuse industrial applications and beverage segments that effectively address the increasing challenges of clean water scarcity rising energy costs and pollution cpt’s product offerings include innovative ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membrane technologies aseptic valves co 2 recovery and control systems and specialty pumping equipment based in the netherlands cpt has broad sales diversity with the majority of 2011 and 2010 revenues generated in european union and asiapacific countries 

information regarding all business segments 

backlog 

our backlog of orders as of december 31 by segment was 

 

 the 1551 million increase in water  fluid solutions backlog was primarily due to increased backlog related to the may 2011 acquisition of cpt the 179 million decrease in technical products backlog reflected larger telecommunications project backlog at december 31 2010 due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and 

  

general industry practice for the majority of our businesses backlog which typically represents less than 60 days of shipments is not deemed to be a significant item a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month we expect that most of our backlog at december 31 2011 will be filled in 2012 

research and development 

we primarily conduct research and development activities in our own facilities these efforts consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2011 2010 and 2009 were 782 million 672 million and 579 million respectively

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the manufacturing of our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies copper and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future 

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trade mark trade name or brand name

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements you should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties if any of the risks described below actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in that case the price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to other information set forth in this document we assume no obligation and disclaim any duty to update risk factors in this report except as required by law 

general economic conditions including difficult credit and residential construction markets affect demand for our products 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets among these the most significant are global industrial markets for both technical products and water  fluid solutions and residential markets for water  fluid solutions important factors for our businesses include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing for our customers and endusers and interest rates new construction for housing and home improvement activity fell in 2007 2008 and 2009 which reduced revenue growth in the residential business within water  fluid solutions while we saw some stabilization in 2010 and 2011 we believe that weakness in this market could negatively impact our revenues and margins in future periods while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions we cannot assure you that a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region would not have a material adverse effect on us 

we are exposed to political regulatory economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

sales outside of the united states including export sales from our domestic businesses accounted for approximately 40 of our net sales in 2011 further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from foreign suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political regulatory economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of our international operations and sales we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act the united kingdom bribery act and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of improper payments our international activities create risk under such laws because our employees consultants sales agents or distributors are not always subject to our direct control any violations or alleged violations of these laws could result in significant fines or settlements criminal sanctions against us or our employees reputational damage and prohibitions on the conduct of our business including our business with the us government 

our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

our international operations are subject to foreign market and currency fluctuation risks and the european union debt crisis could adversely affect our results 

we expect the percentage of our sales outside of the united states to continue to increase in the future in some cases foreign markets are susceptible to greater political economic and social volatility than in our other markets furthermore our increased foreign business operations expose us to currency fluctuations which could materially affect our financial results the european union currently accounts for the majority of our foreign sales and income the current debt crisis in europe could lead to the reintroduction of individual currencies in certain european union countries or in the wholesale dissolution of the euro currency the resulting impact on eurodenominated obligations and assets is impossible to predict but it could adversely affect the value of such obligations and assets also the effect of the debt crisis in europe could have an adverse affect on the capital markets generally specifically impacting the ability of our business and financial partners to finance their businesses on acceptable terms if at all the availability of materials and supplies and demand for our products 

our inability to sustain organic growth could adversely affect our financial performance 

over the past five years our organic growth has been generated in part from expanding international sales entering new distribution channels introducing new products and price increases to grow more rapidly than our end markets we would have to continue to expand our geographic reach further diversify our distribution channels continue to introduce new products and increase sales of existing products to our customer base difficult economic and competitive factors may materially and adversely impact our financial performance we have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end markets and geographies we cannot assure you that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets 

we may not be able to expand through acquisitions and acquisitions we complete may adversely affect our financial performance 

we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions primarily in our current business segments though we may consider acquisitions outside of these segments as well our ability to expand through acquisitions is subject to various risks including the following 

 

   

  

  

 we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions any benefits may take longer to realize than we expect and acquisitions we complete may adversely affect our financial performance 

any acquisition involves the integration of acquired operations with our existing operations and there are uncertainties inherent in such an integration we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to such an integration and delays or unexpected difficulties in the integration process could adversely affect our business financial results and financial condition even if we are successful in integrating acquired operations we may not achieve the full benefits of revenue synergies cost savings and operational efficiencies that we expect or within the time we expect acquisitions we may undertake could have a material adverse effect on our operating results particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisitions while we attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our operations in addition we may have not discovered during due diligence all facts and factors that could produce unintended or unexpected consequences for us including financial liabilities which could be material and result in us not achieving the expected benefits from the acquisition within our desired time frames if at all 

as we continue our integration of cpt’s operations with our existing operations uncertainties remain and we may not achieve the full expected benefits of that acquisition including revenue synergies cost savings and operational efficiencies or within the time we expect 

increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations 

as of december 31 2011 we had 13091 million of total debt on a consolidated basis any future increase in our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations including without limitation 

 

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements we may be required among other things 

 

  

  

  

   

such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms if at all 

the availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

our plans to vigorously compete in our chosen markets will require additional capital for future acquisitions capital expenditures growth of working capital and continued international and regional expansion in the past we have financed growth of our businesses primarily through cash from operations and debt financing while we have availability under our primary credit agreements on what we believe to be favorable terms future acquisitions or other uses of funds may require us to expand our debt financing resources or to issue equity securities our financial results may be adversely affected if new financing is not available on favorable terms or if interest costs under our debt financings are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other internal growth in addition future share issuances could be dilutive to your equity investment if we sell shares into the market or issue additional stock as consideration in any acquisition we cannot assure you that we will be able to issue equity securities or obtain future debt financing at favorable terms without sufficient financing we will not be able to pursue our targeted growth strategy and our acquisition program which may limit our revenue growth and future financial performance 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets at december 31 2011 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately 28662 million and represented approximately 625 of our total assets longterm declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as a result we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 2005 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 this represents impairment of goodwill in our residential filtration reporting unit part of water  fluid solutions the impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions prevailing in these markets and due to continued softness in the endmarkets served by residential water treatment components 

material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs we cannot assure you however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

our businesses operate in highly competitive markets so we may be forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs 

our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of their respective markets competition may force us to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive we compete on the basis of product design quality availability performance customer service and price present or future competitors may have greater 

  

financial technical or other resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected business or businesses we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within water  fluid solutions enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts we cannot assure you that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

intellectual property challenges may hinder product development and marketing 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products our pending patent applications and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents copyrights or trademarks in addition our patents copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products we may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

our businesses expose us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses 

  

we cannot ensure you that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol and this and other international initiatives under consideration could affect our international operations these actions could increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

while we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “legal proceedings” could change in the future 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or prp in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in the past years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability we have also made claims against third parties for indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental remediations or other obligations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for such costs 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to 

  

environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2011 and 2010 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 15 million and 13 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims

overview 

we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water  fluid solutions and technical products water  fluid solutions is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water technical products is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets designing and manufacturing standard modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components and protect the people that use them in 2011 water  fluid solutions and technical products accounted for approximately 23 and 13 of total revenues respectively 

water  fluid solutions has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately 125 million in 1995 to approximately 24 billion in 2011 we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water 

technical products operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as industrial energy infrastructure and communications we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america for enclosures and the highest brand recognition in the industry in north america 

in may 2011 we acquired as part of water  fluid solutions the cpt division of privately held norit holding bv for 7153 million €5027 million translated at the may 12 2011 exchange rate cpt’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition cpt is a global leader in membrane solutions and clean process technologies in the high growth water and beverage filtration and separation segments cpt provides sustainable purification systems and solutions for desalination water reuse industrial applications and beverage segments that effectively address the increasing challenges of clean water scarcity rising energy costs and pollution cpt’s product offerings include innovative ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membrane technologies aseptic valves co 2 recovery and control systems and specialty pumping equipment based in the netherlands cpt has broad sales diversity with the majority of 2011 and 2010 revenues generated in european union and asiapacific countries 

the fair value of the business acquired was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value acquired over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is reflected as goodwill goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was 4518 million none of which is tax deductible identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were 1972 million including definitelived intangibles such as customer relationships proprietary technology and trade names with a weighted average amortization period of approximately 10 years 

  

in january 2011 we acquired as part of water  fluid solutions all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of hidro filtros do brasil “hidro filtros” for cash of 149 million and a note payable of 21 million the hidro filtros results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition hidro filtros is a leading manufacturer of water filters and filtering elements for residential and industrial applications operating in brazil and neighboring countries goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was 101 million none of which is tax deductible identified intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were 63 million including definitelived intangibles primarily customer relationships of 55 million with an estimated life of 13 years 

additionally during 2011 we completed other small acquisitions with purchase prices totaling 46 million consisting of 29 million in cash and 17 million as a note payable adding to water  fluid solutions total goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was 43 million none of which is tax deductible 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as a result we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 2005 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 this represents impairment of goodwill in our residential filtration reporting unit part of water  fluid solutions the impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions prevailing in these markets and due to continued softness in the endmarkets served by residential water treatment components 

key trends and uncertainties 

our sales revenue for the full year of 2011 was approximately 35 billion increasing 14 from sales in the prior year water  fluid solutions sales increased 16 in the year to approximately 24 billion compared to the same period in 2010 technical products sales increased 10 to approximately 11 billion as compared to the same period in 2010 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2011 and will likely impact our results in the future 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 in 2012 our operating objectives include the following 

 

  

  

  

 we may seek to meet our objectives of expanding our geographic reach internationally expanding our presence in our various channels to market and acquiring technologies and products to broaden our businesses’ capabilities to serve additional markets through acquisitions we may also consider the divestiture of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their most attractive markets

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings we have grown our businesses in significant part in the past through acquisitions financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time by private or public debt issuance our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions 

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within water  fluid solutions we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 3202 million in 2011 or 498 million higher than in 2010 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net income before noncash items partially offset by increased working capital necessary to support revenue growth 

cash provided by operating activities was 2704 million in 2010 or 120 million higher than in 2009 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a reduction in working capital partially offset by an accelerated pension contribution of 25 million and lower income from continuing operations 

investing activities 

capital expenditures in 2011 2010 and 2009 were 733 million 595 million and 541 million respectively we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 to be approximately 75 to 85 million primarily for capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing facilities new product development and general maintenance capital 

in january 2011 we acquired as part of water  fluid solutions all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of hidro filtros for cash of 149 million and a note payable of 21 million 

in may 2011 we acquired as part of water  fluid solutions the cpt division from privately held norit holding for 7153 million 

additionally during 2011 we completed other small acquisitions with purchase prices totaling 46 million consisting of 29 million in cash and 17 million as a note payable adding to water  fluid solutions 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 5036 million in 2011 and net cash used for financing activities was 1906 million in 2010 and 2091 in 2009 the increase in 2011 primarily related to borrowing utilized to fund the cpt acquisition additionally financing activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business payments of dividends cash receivedused for stock issued to employees repurchase of common stock and tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

  

in may 2011 we completed a public offering of 500 million aggregate principal amount of our 500 senior notes due 2021 the “notes” the notes are guaranteed by certain of our whollyowned domestic subsidiaries that are also guarantors under our primary bank credit facility we used the net proceeds from the offering of the notes to finance in part the cpt acquisition 

in april 2011 we entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement the “credit facility” the credit facility replaced our previous 800 million revolving credit facility the credit facility creates an unsecured committed credit facility of up to 700 million with multicurrency sub facilities to support investments outside the us the credit facility expires on april 28 2016 borrowings under the credit facility currently bear interest at the rate of london interbank offered rate “libor” plus 175 interest rates and fees on the credit facility will vary based on our credit ratings we used borrowings under the credit facility to fund a portion of the cpt acquisition and to fund ongoing operations 

we are authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility we use the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding our use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the relative interest rates for our commercial paper compared to the cost of borrowing under our credit facility as of december 31 2011 we had 35 million of commercial paper outstanding 

total availability under our existing credit facility was 5280 million as of december 31 2011 which was limited to 4803 million by the leverage ratio financial covenant in the credit agreement 

our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants the most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio total consolidated indebtedness as defined over consolidated net income before interest taxes depreciation amortization and noncash compensation expense as defined that may not exceed 35 to 10 as of the last date of each of our fiscal quarters we were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements as of december 31 2011 

in addition to the credit facility we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of 742 million of which 141 million was outstanding at december 31 2011 borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates additionally as part of the cpt acquisition we assumed certain capital leases with an outstanding balance of 158 million at december 31 2011 

we have 105 million of outstanding private placement debt maturing in may 2012 we classified this debt as longterm as of december 31 2011 as we have the intent and ability to refinance such obligation on a longterm basis under the credit facility 

our cost of and ability to obtain debt financing may be impacted by our credit ratings our longterm debt is rated at bbb by standard  poor’s “sp” with stable outlook and baa3 by moody’s with stable outlook 

we issue shortterm commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by sp or moody’s even though our shortterm commercial paper is unrated we believe a downgrade in our credit rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 

we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our credit rating by either sp or moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the longterm debt capital markets however depending upon market conditions the amount timing and pricing of new borrowings and interest rates under our credit facility could be adversely affected if both of our credit ratings were downgraded to below bbbbaa3 our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 

a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program the credit rating takes into 

  

consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders annually we believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

we paid dividends in 2011 of 795 million compared with 755 million in 2010 and 709 million in 2009 we recently announced an increase in our dividend rate for 2012 from 080 per share in 2011 to 088 per share in 2012 which is the 36th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend 

in july 2010 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 25 million as of december 31 2010 we had repurchased 734603 shares for 25 million pursuant to this plan in december 2010 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 25 million as of december 31 2011 we had repurchased 389300 shares for 125 million pursuant to this authorization which expired in december 2011 in december 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 25 million this authorization expires in december 2012 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

 

 in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2011 variable interest rate debt including the effects of derivative financial instruments was 2020 million at a weighted average interest rate of 225 

the estimated annual pension plan contribution amounts are intended to achieve fully funded status of our domestic qualified pension plan in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 pension and post retirement plan contributions are based on an assumed discount rate of 505 for all periods and an expected rate of return on plan assets ranging from 505 to 750 

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2011 is estimated to be approximately 265 million we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes 

  

and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2011 we had recorded approximately 09 million for the possible payment of penalties and 59 million related to the possible payment of interest 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 conversion of net income from continuing operations free cash flow is a nongenerally accepted accounting principles financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 

 

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2011 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

commitments and contingencies 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or prp in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” as of december 31 2011 and 2010 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 15 million and 13 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

  

standby letters of credit and bonds 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs and certain legal matters as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 1362 million and 1165 million respectively 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

 our critical accounting estimates include the following 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

  

in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and longterm business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a five year longterm planning period the five year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated revenues and operating profit beyond 2018 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate between 30 and 35 

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we utilized a discount rate ranging from 126 to 14 in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each operating segment that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of ebitda we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

in connection with our annual impairment test we determined that the fair value of one of our reporting units did not exceed its carrying value by a significant amount goodwill for this reporting unit was 7999 million at december 31 2011 if cash flow projections decreased by 67 or if the discount rate increased by 70 basis points the discount rate used in the impairment analysis was 126 this reporting unit would have failed the step one test and a step two analysis would have been required 

impairment charge 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we completed our annual goodwill impairment review as a result we recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of 2005 million this represents impairment of goodwill in our residential filtration reporting unit part of water  fluid solutions the impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions prevailing in these markets and due to continued softness in the endmarkets served by residential water treatment components 

identifiable intangible assets 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks and trade names patents noncompete agreements proprietary technology and customer relationships identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant we complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization there was no impairment charge recorded in 2011 or 2010 for identifiable intangible assets an impairment charge of 113 million was recorded in 2009 related to trade names these charges were recorded in selling general and administrative in our consolidated statements of income 

the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the impairment charge recorded in 2009 was the result of significant declines in sales volume 

at december 31 2011 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately 28662 million and represented approximately 625 of our total assets if we experience future declines in sales and operating profit or do not 

  

meet our operating forecasts we may be subject to future impairments additionally changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses increases in the discount rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price or the market as a whole could result in additional impairment indicators because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets there were no impairment charges recorded related to longlived assets in 2011 2010 or 2009 

pension 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 12 to the notes to consolidated financial statements changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense pension contributions and the funded status of our pension plans 

we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheets with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a discount rate for our us plans of 505 in 2011 590 in 2010 and 600 in 2009 the discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 075 to 500 in 2011 075 to 540 in 2010 and 200 to 600 in 2009 there are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2012 

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets was 80 for 2011 and 85 in 2010 and 2009 the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices 

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyearperiod the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 

see item 8 note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement in this case we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are at variable interest rates of 3 month libor plus 50 for 105 million of debt and 3 month libor plus 60 for 100 million of debt additionally failure of one or all of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio excluding the impact of swap agreements as of december 31 2011 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 69 fixedrate debt and 31 variablerate debt not considering the effects of our interest rate swaps taking into account the variable to fixedrate swap agreements we entered into with an effective date of april 2006 and august 2007 our debt portfolio is comprised of 85 fixedrate debt and 15 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2011 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 530 million increase or 580 million decrease in fair value 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2011 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 20 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar we use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar from time to time we may enter in to short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks

focused on product development continued channel penetration growth in targeted market segments geographic expansion and price increases consolidation globalization and outsourcing are visible trends in the technical products marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier we believe our technical products group has the global manufacturing capability and broad product portfolio to support the globalization and outsourcing trends 

 

information regarding all business segments 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog of orders as of december 31 by segment was 

 

 

 

the 915 million decrease in water group backlog was primarily due to reduced backlog related to the gulf intracoastal waterway project and other large municipal projects for the engineered flow global business unit at december 31 2010 the 332 million increase in the technical products group backlog reflected growth across our vertical markets served due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry practice for the majority of our businesses backlog which typically represents less than 60 days of shipments is not deemed to be a significant item a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month we expect that most of our backlog at december 31 2010 will be filled in 2011 

 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in our own facilities which consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2010 2009 and 2008 were 672 million 579 million and 625 million respectively

the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements you should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties if any of the risks described below actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in that case the price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to other information set forth in this document 

 

general economic conditions including difficult credit and residential construction markets affect demand for our products 

 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets among these the most significant are global industrial markets for both the technical products and water groups and residential markets for the water group important factors for our businesses include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing for our customers and endusers and interest rates new construction for residential 

housing and home improvement activity fell in 2007 2008 and 2009 which reduced revenue growth in the residential businesses within our water group while we saw some stabilization in 2010 we believe that weakness in this market could negatively impact our revenues and margins in future periods further while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions we cannot assure you that a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region would not have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our inability to sustain organic growth could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

over the past five years our organic growth has been generated in part from expanding international sales entering new distribution channels introducing new products and price increases to grow more rapidly than our end markets we would have to continue to expand our geographic reach further diversify our distribution channels continue to introduce new products and increase sales of existing products to our customer base difficult economic and competitive factors materially and adversely impacted our financial performance in 2009 these conditions started to improve in many of our end markets in 2010 but we cannot assure you that these markets will continue to improve nor that we will be able to increase revenues and profitability to match our earlier financial performance we have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end markets and geographies we cannot assure you that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets 

 

our businesses operate in highly competitive markets so we may be forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs 

 

our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of their respective markets competition may force us to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive we compete on the basis of product design quality availability performance customer service and price present or future competitors may have greater financial technical or other resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected business or businesses we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 

 

material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations 

 

in the past we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we strive for productivity improvements and implement increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we continue to implement our excellence in operations initiatives in order to mitigate the impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs we cannot assure you however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales increase is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts we cannot assure you that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

intellectual property challenges may hinder product development and marketing 

 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude 

competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products 

 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

 

our businesses expose us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may not be able to expand through acquisitions and acquisitions we complete may adversely affect our financial performance 

 

we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions primarily in our current business segments though we may consider acquisitions outside of these segments as well our ability to expand through acquisitions is subject to various risks including the following 

 

  

acquisitions we may undertake could have a material adverse effect on our operating results particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisitions while we attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our operations once integrated acquired operations may not achieve the levels of financial performance originally anticipated 

 

the availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

 

our plans to vigorously compete in our chosen markets will require additional capital for future acquisitions capital expenditures growth of working capital and continued international and regional expansion in the past we have financed growth of our businesses primarily through cash from operations and debt financing while we refinanced our primary credit agreements in 2007 on what we believe to be favorable terms future acquisitions or other uses of funds may require us to expand our debt financing resources or to issue equity securities our financial results may be adversely affected if new financing is not available on favorable terms or if interest costs under our debt financings are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other internal growth in addition future share issuances could be dilutive to your equity investment if we sell shares into the market or issue additional stock as consideration in any acquisition we cannot assure you that we will be able to issue equity securities or obtain future debt financing at favorable terms without sufficient financing we will not be able to pursue our targeted growth strategy and our acquisition program which may limit our revenue growth and future financial performance 

 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

 

sales outside of the united states including export sales from our domestic businesses accounted for approximately 34 of our net sales in both 2010 and 2009 further most of our businesses obtain some 

products components and raw materials from foreign suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 

  

our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

 

our international operations are subject to foreign market and currency fluctuation risks 

 

we expect the percentage of our sales outside of the united states to increase in the future over the past few years the economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do business have had slower growth than the us economy the european union currently accounts for the majority of our foreign sales and income in which our most significant european market is germany in addition we have a significant and growing business in the asiapacific region but the economic conditions in countries in this region are subject to different growth expectations market weaknesses and business practices we cannot predict how changing market conditions in these regions will impact our financial results 

 

we are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results as we manufacture and source certain products components and raw materials throughout the world 

 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets at december 31 2010 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately 25196 million and represented approximately 634 of our total assets longterm declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could 

harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require 

 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses 

 

we cannot ensure you that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

we are exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions the us congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol and this and other international initiatives under consideration could affect our international operations these actions could increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

provisions of our restated articles of incorporation bylaws and minnesota law could deter takeover attempts 

 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents under minnesota law and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor 

 

our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions relating to the election appointment and removal of directors as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting requirements which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control in addition our common share purchase rights could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us which could deter some acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers also the minnesota business corporations act contains control share acquisition and business combination provisions which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control our shareholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

 

while we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “legal proceedings” could change in the future 

 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or prp in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in the past years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability we have also made claims against third parties for indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental remediations or other obligations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for such costs 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2010 and 2009 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 13 million and 23 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability 

has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available in 2004 we disposed of the tools group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims

overview 

we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets designing and manufacturing standard modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components and protect the people that use them in 2010 our water group and technical products group accounted for approximately 23 and 13 of total revenues respectively 

 

our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately 125 million in 1995 to approximately 20 billion in 2010 we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water 

 

on june 28 2008 we entered into a transaction with ge that was accounted for as an acquisition of an 801 percent ownership interest in ge’s global water softener and residential water filtration business in exchange for a 199 percent interest in our global water softener and residential water filtration business the acquisition was effected through the formation of two new entities collectively “pentair residential filtration” or “prf” a us entity and an international entity into which we and ge contributed certain assets properties liabilities and operations representing our respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses we are an 801 percent owner of the new entities and ge is a 199 percent owner 

 

with the formation of pentair residential filtration we believe we are better positioned to serve residential customers with industryleading technical applications in the areas of water conditioning whole house and point of use filtration 

 

our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as data communications industrial infrastructure and energy we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america for enclosures and the highest brand recognition in the industry in north america 

 

key trends and uncertainties 

 

our sales revenue for the full year of 2010 was approximately 30 billion increasing 13 from sales in the prior year our water group sales increased 10 in the year to approximately 20 billion compared to the same period in 2009 our technical products group sales increased 17 to approximately 10 billion as compared to the same period in 2009 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2010 and will likely impact our results in the future

 21 

 

  

we may seek to meet our objectives of expanding our geographic reach internationally expanding our presence in our various channels to market and acquiring technologies and products to broaden our businesses’ capabilities to serve additional markets though acquisitions we may also consider the divestiture of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their most attractive markets

we expect our full year effective tax rate in 2011 to be between 32 and 325 we will continue to pursue tax rate reduction opportunities 

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings we have grown our businesses in significant part in the past through acquisitions financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time by private or public debt issuance our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions these are temporary loans that have in the past been repaid within less than a year 

 

we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt while continuing to fund our research and development marketing and capital investment initiatives our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 

 

our current 800 million multicurrency revolving credit facility the “credit facility” expires on june 4 2012 the agent banks under the credit facility are jp morgan bank of america wells fargo us bank and bank of tokyomitsubishi we believe we have ample borrowing capacity for our currently projected operating needs our availability under the credit facility was 7025 million at december 31 2010 which was not limited by any of the credit agreement’s financial covenants as of that date 

 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2704 million in 2010 or 120 million higher than in 2009 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to higher income from continuing operations offset by increased working capital necessary to support revenue growth 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 2584 million in 2009 or 542 million higher than in 2008 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a reduction in working capital offset by an accelerated pension contribution of 25 million and lower income from continuing operations 

 

in december 2008 we sold approximately 44 million of a customer’s account receivable to a thirdparty financial institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows in 2008 we incurred a loss in the amount of 05 million related to the sale of accounts receivable which is included in the line item other in our consolidated statements of income we did not undertake a similar sale of customer receivables in 2009 or 2010 

 

investing activities 

capital expenditures in 2010 2009 and 2008 were 595 million 541 million and 531 million respectively we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 to be approximately 60 to 65 million primarily for capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing facilities new product development and general maintenance capital 

 

on december 15 2008 we sold our spa and bath “spabath” business to balboa water group in a cash transaction for 92 million the results of spabath have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

on february 28 2008 we sold our national pool tile “npt” business to pool corporation in a cash transaction for 298 million the results of npt have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 04 million in 2010 and 12 million in 2009 was primarily related to various asset dispositions cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 47 million in 2008 was primarily related to the sale of a facility in our water group 

 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 1906 in 2010 2091 million in 2009 and 2172 in 2008 the decrease primarily relates to fluctuations in liquidity financing activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business payments of dividends cash receivedused for stock issued to employees repurchase of common stock and tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

 

the credit facility creates an unsecured committed revolving credit facility of up to 800 million with multicurrency sub facilities to support investments outside the us borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the rate of libor plus 0625 interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings we believe that internally generated funds and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to support our normal operations dividend payments stock repurchases and debt maturities over the life of the credit facility 

 

we are authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility we use the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding our use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the relative interest rates for our commercial paper compared to the cost of borrowing under our credit facility as of december 31 2010 and 2009 we had no outstanding commercial paper 

 

our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants the most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio total consolidated indebtedness as defined over consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization “ebitda” as defined that may not exceed 35 to 10 we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of december 31 2010 

 

in addition to the credit facility we have 400 million of uncommitted credit facilities under which we had 48 million of borrowings as of december 31 2010 

 

our current credit ratings are as follows 

 

 

 

our longterm debt rating is an investment grade rating investment grade is a credit rating of bbb or higher by standard  poor’s or baa3 or higher by moody’s 

 

on march 28 2010 standard  poor’s “sp” affirmed our bbb rating with a stable outlook on april 6 2010 moody’s affirmed our baa3 rating and changed our current rating outlook from negative to stable 

 

a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not material to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt 

we issue shortterm commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard  poor’s or moody’s even though our shortterm commercial paper is unrated we believe a downgrade in our longterm debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 

 

we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our longterm debt by either standard  poor’s or moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the longterm debt capital markets however depending upon market conditions the amount timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected if both of our longterm debt ratings were downgraded to below bbbbaa3 our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 

 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders annually we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

 

we paid dividends in 2010 of 755 million compared with 709 million in 2009 and 673 million in 2008 we recently announced an increase in our dividend rate for 2011 from 076 per share in 2010 to 080 per share in 2011 which is the 35th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend 

 

in december 2007 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock during 2008 up to a maximum dollar limit of 50 million as of december 31 2008 we had purchased 1549893 shares for 50 million pursuant to this authorization this authorization expired on december 31 2008 no authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock was sought from or granted by our board for 2009 on july 27 2010 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 25 million as of december 31 2010 we had repurchased 734603 shares for 25 million pursuant to this plan in december 2010 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 25 million the authorization expires december 2011 

 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

 

 

 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2010 variable interest rate debt including the effects of derivative financial instruments was 1024 million at a weighted average interest rate of 105 

 

the estimated annual pension plan contribution amounts are intended to achieve fully funded status of our domestic qualified pension plan in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 

 

pension and post retirement plan contributions are based on an assumed discount rate of 59 for all periods and an expected rate of return on plan assets ranging from 60 to 80 in december 2010 and 2009 we made accelerated contributions of 25 million to our defined benefit pension plan 

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2010 is estimated to be approximately 243 million we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes and interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2010 we had recorded approximately 08 million for the possible payment of penalties and 48 million related to the possible payment of interest 

 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 conversion of net income from continuing operations free cash flow is a nongenerally accepted accounting principles financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends make acquisitions repay debt and repurchase shares in addition free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow 

 

 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2010 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

 

commitments and contingencies 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or prp in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” as of december 31 2010 and 2009 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 13 million and 23 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

standby letters of credit and bonds 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs and certain legal matters as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 1165 million and 512 million respectively 

 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased 

 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

 

in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and longterm business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a five year longterm planning period the five year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit 

being evaluated revenues and operating profit beyond 2017 are projected to grow at a 3 perpetual growth rate for all reporting units 

 

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we utilized a discount rate ranging from 13 to 15 in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis 

 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each operating segment that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of ebitda we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

 

we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter with each reporting unit’s fair value exceeding its carrying value accordingly step two of the impairment analysis was not required 

 

in connection with our annual impairment test we determined that the fair value of one of our reporting units did not exceed its carrying value by a significant amount goodwill for this reporting unit was 4366 million at december 31 2010 if cash flow projections decreased by 27 or if the discount rate increased by 50 basis points the discount rate used in the impairment analysis was 135 this reporting unit would have failed the step one test and a step two analysis would have been required 

 

indefinitelived intangibles 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks and trade names patents noncompete agreements proprietary technology and customer relationships identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant during the fourth quarter of 2010 and 2009 we completed our annual impairment test for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization there were no impairment charges recorded in 2010 we recorded impairment charges of 113 million in 2009 these charges were recorded in selling general and administrative in our consolidated statements of income 

 

the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the impairment charge recorded in 2009 was the result of significant declines in sales volume 

 

at december 31 2010 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately 25196 million and represented approximately 634 of our total assets if we experience further declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet our operating forecasts we may be subject to future impairments additionally changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses increases in the discount rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price or the market as a whole could result in additional impairment indicators because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying 

value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets 

 

pension 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 12 to the notes to consolidated financial statements changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense pension contributions and the funded status of our pension plans 

 

we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheets with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 

 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a discount rate for our us plans of 590 in 2010 600 in 2009 and 650 in 2008 the discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 075 to 540 in 2010 200 to 600 in 2009 and 200 to 625 in 2008 there are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2011 

 

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets was 85 for 2010 2009 and 2008 the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices 

 

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyearperiod the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement in this case we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are at variable interest rates of 3 month libor plus 50 for 105 million of debt and 3 month libor plus 60 for 100 million of debt additionally failure of one or all of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio excluding impact of swap agreements as of december 31 2010 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 56 fixedrate debt and 44 variablerate debt not considering the effects of our interest rate swaps taking into account the variable to fixedrate swap agreements we entered into with an effective date of april 2006 and august 2007 our debt portfolio is comprised of 85 fixedrate debt and 15 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2010 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 200 million increase or decrease in fair value 

 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2010 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 10 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar from time to time we may enter in to short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risk on intercompany transactions

seasonality 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

 

competition 

our water group faces numerous domestic and international competitors some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the markets in which we compete consolidation globalization and outsourcing are continuing trends in the water industry competition in commercial and residential flow technologies markets focuses on trade names product performance quality and price while home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps they are not important for commercial pumps for municipal pumps competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications service and price competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses on product performance and design quality delivery and price for pool equipment competition focuses on trade names product performance quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing market penetration

information regarding all business segments 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog of orders as of december 31 by segment was 

 

 

 

the 203 million decrease in water group backlog was primarily due to decreased backlog for the filtration solutions codeline product line capacity constraints in 2008 led to above average backlogs compounded by volume declines in q4 2009 these decreases were partially offset by the timing of the early buy program shipments in residential pool markets the 172 million decrease in the technical products group backlog reflected declining market conditions especially in our electronics markets due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry practice for the majority of our businesses backlog which typically represents less than 60 days of shipments is not deemed to be material a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month we expect that most of our backlog at december 31 2009 will be filled in 2010 

 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in our own facilities which consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2009 2008 and 2007 were 579 million 625 million and 568 million respectively

the principal materials used in the manufacturing of our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

 

the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages todate due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with escalator  deescalator clauses prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future 

 

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks and trade names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trade mark and trade name 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the termination of patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 13150 people worldwide total employees in the united states were approximately 6600 of whom approximately 530 are represented by five different trade unions having collective bargaining agreements generally labor relations have been satisfactory 

 

captive insurance subsidiary 

we insure certain general and product liability property workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary penwald insurance company “penwald” reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses prepenwald liabilities and those of certain foreign operations are established without regard to the availability of insurance

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements you should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties if any of the risks described below actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in that case the price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to other information set forth in this document 

 

general economic conditions including difficult credit and residential construction markets affect demand for our products 

 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets among these the most significant are global industrial and commercial markets for both the water and technical products groups and residential markets for the water group the global recession adversely affected the robustness of our markets throughout 2009 important factors that impact our businesses include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing for our customers and endusers and interest rates new construction for residential housing and home improvement activity fell in each of the past three years and particularly in 2009 which reduced revenue in each of the businesses within our water group over this period we believe that weakness in the residential housing market and the recent dramatic slowdown in our industrial and commercial markets will likely continue to affect our revenues and margins into 2010 any continuing weakness in these markets beyond 2009 will negatively affect our sales and financial performance in future periods 

 

continuing market weakness is likely to limit recovery in our revenues and profitability from prerecessionary levels 

 

over the past four years our organic growth has been generated in part from expanding international sales entering new distribution channels price increases and introducing new products to grow more rapidly than our end markets we would have to continue to expand our geographic reach further diversify our distribution channels continue to introduce new products and increase sales of existing products to our customer base difficult economic and competitive factors in late 2008 and throughout 2009 adversely affected our ability to grow our revenues over this period these economic conditions materially and adversely impacted our financial performance in 2009 we did not meet our projected revenue growth or earnings targets for the year 2009 we believe that these market weaknesses have started to stabilize in many of our end markets but we can not assure you that these markets will continue to improve nor that we will be able to increase revenues and profitability to match our earlier financial performance rather than focus our sales efforts primarily on broadbased revenue growth we have chosen to limit our growth initiatives to specific end markets and geographies we cannot assure you that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets 

 

our businesses operate in highly competitive markets so we may be forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs 

 

our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of their respective markets competition may force us to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive we compete on the basis of product design quality availability performance customer service and price present or future competitors may have greater financial technical or other resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected business or businesses we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 

material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations 

 

in previous years we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance while these inflationary pressures dramatically weakened in late 2008 and early 2009 as a result of general economic conditions the recent reversal of material cost inflation may not be sustainable once the economy begins to strengthen we also are continuing to implement our excellence in operations initiatives in order to continuously reduce our costs we cannot assure you however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts we cannot assure you that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

intellectual property challenges may hinder product development and marketing 

 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks and trade names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products and increased costs may hinder our product development and marketing 

 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

 

our business exposes us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we have an active product safety program and we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

reductions in our acquisition activity will likely slow our revenue growth or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

 

over the past four years much of our growth has resulted from acquisitions of businesses within our current business segments while we intend to continue to evaluate acquisitions in these segments given the current financial and economic environment we are uncertain whether we will be able to make major acquisitions until business conditions improve further we cannot assure you that we would be able to continue to grow our revenue or to limit revenue declines without making acquisitions acquisitions we may undertake could have a material adverse effect on our operating results particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisitions while we attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our operations once integrated acquired operations may not achieve the levels of profitability originally anticipated 

the availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

 

our plans to vigorously compete in our chosen markets will require additional capital for future acquisitions capital expenditures growth of working capital and continued international and regional expansion in the past we have financed growth of our businesses primarily through cash from operations and debt financing while we refinanced our primary credit agreements in the second quarter of 2007 on what we believe to be favorable terms future acquisitions or other uses of funds may require us to expand our debt financing resources or to issue equity securities our financial results may be adversely affected if new financing is not available on favorable terms or if interest costs under our debt financings are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other internal growth in addition future share issuances could be dilutive to your equity investment if we sell shares into the market or issue additional stock as consideration in any acquisition we cannot assure you that we will be able to issue equity securities or obtain future debt financing at favorable terms without sufficient financing we will not be able to pursue our targeted growth strategy and our acquisition program which will limit our revenue growth and future financial performance 

 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

 

sales outside of the united states including export sales from our domestic businesses accounted for approximately 34 of our net sales in 2009 down from 35 in 2008 further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from foreign suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 

  

our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

 

our international operations are subject to foreign market and currency fluctuation risks 

 

we expect the percentage of our sales outside of north america to increase in the future over the past few years the economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do business have had slower growth than the us economy the european union currently accounts for the majority of our foreign sales and income in which our most significant european market is germany each market area is currently experiencing similar economic difficulties to those in the united states and sales in those markets slowed significantly through 2009 in addition we have a significant and growing business in the asiapacific area but the economic conditions in countries in this region are subject to different growth expectations market weaknesses and business practices we cannot predict how changing market conditions in these regions will impact our financial results 

we are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results in 2009 the weakness of the us dollar slightly benefited our financial results in foreign jurisdictions we are uncertain whether weakness in the us dollar will continue and if so the extent to which it may hurt our financial results on a comparative basis in addition we source certain products components and raw materials throughout the world the import of which into the united states has raised the cost of these goods in us dollars and has impacted the results of our domestic businesses as well 

 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as required by the accounting guidance by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on our balance sheet goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually as of the first day of our third quarter using management’s operating budget and internal fiveyear forecast to estimate expected future cash flows projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate the projections also take into account several factors including current and estimated economic trends and outlook costs of raw materials and consideration of our market capitalization in comparison to the estimated fair values of our reporting units during the fourth quarter of 2009 we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and recorded an impairment charge of 113 million to writedown certain trade name intangible assets to their current estimated fair value 

 

at december 31 2009 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately 25752 million and represented approximately 658 of our total assets if we experience further declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet our operating forecasts we may be subject to future impairments additionally changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses increases in the discount rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price could be indicators of impairment losses because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require 

 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses we have also made claims against third parties for indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental remediations or other obligations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for such costs 

 

we cannot ensure you that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

we may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change 

 

climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide many scientists legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions there are a number of pending legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions for example in june 2009 the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act that would phasein significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if enacted into law the us senate is considering a different bill and it is uncertain whether when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted similarly certain countries have adopted the kyoto protocol and this and other international initiatives under consideration could affect our international operations these actions could increase costs associated with our operations including costs for raw materials and transportation because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

 

provisions of our restated articles of incorporation bylaws and minnesota law could deter takeover attempts 

 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents under minnesota law and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor 

 

our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions relating to the election appointment and removal of directors as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting requirements which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control in addition our common share purchase rights could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us which could deter some acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers also the minnesota business corporations act contains control share acquisition and business combination provisions which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control our shareholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

 

we accrue for potential environmental losses in a manner consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that is we record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be reasonably estimated factors that are considered when determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met include the a nature of the litigation claim or assessment b progress 

of the case including progress after the date of the financial statements but before the issuance date of the financial statements c opinions of legal counsel and d management’s intended response to the litigation claim or assessment where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range we record the most likely estimate of the loss when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount however the minimum amount in the range is accrued gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 

 

while we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “legal proceedings” could change in the future 

 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or prp in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in the past years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability we have also made claims against third parties for indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental remediations or other obligations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for such costs 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2009 and 2008 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 23 million and 31 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims

overview 

we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets designing and manufacturing standard modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components and protect the people that use them in 2010 we expect our water group and technical products group to generate approximately 23 and 13 of our total revenues respectively 

 

our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately 125 million in 1995 to approximately 18 billion in 2009 we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target market totaling 60 billion our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water 

 

on february 28 2008 we sold our npt business to pool corporation in a cash transaction the results of npt have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of npt have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

on june 28 2008 we entered into a transaction with ge that was accounted for as an acquisition of an 801 percent ownership interest in ge’s global water softener and residential water filtration business in exchange for a 199 percent interest in our global water softener and residential water filtration business the acquisition was effected through the formation of two new entities a us entity and an international entity collectively “pentair residential filtration” or “prf” into which we and ge contributed certain assets properties liabilities and operations representing our respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses we are an 801 percent owner of the new entities and ge is a 199 percent owner 

 

with the formation of prf we believe we are better positioned to serve residential customers with industryleading technical applications in the areas of water conditioning whole house filtration point of use water management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate revenue growth by selling ge’s existing residential conditioning products through our sales channels 

 

on december 15 2008 we sold our spabath business to balboa water group in a cash transaction the results of spabath have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of spabath have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as energy medical and security and defense we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america for enclosures and the highest brand recognition in the industry in north america from mid2001 through 2003 the technical products group experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and overcapacity and weak demand in the data communication and telecommunication 

markets from 2004 through 2008 sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors new products price increases and higher demand in targeted markets in 2009 sales revenues in our technical products group declined significantly due to the impact of the global recession 

 

key trends and uncertainties 

 

our sales revenue for the full year of 2009 was approximately 27 billion decreasing 20 from sales in the prior year our water group sales declined 16 in the year to approximately 18 billion compared to the same period in 2008 our technical products group sales decreased 26 to approximately 08 billion in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 

 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2009 and will likely impact our results in 2010 and beyond 

 

 21 

  

  

outlook 

 

in 2010 our operating objectives include the following 

 

  

on february 2 2010 we announced our results of operations for fiscal year 2009 and our earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2010 of a range of 032 to 035 per share on a diluted basis for the full year 2010 of a range of 175 to 190 per share on a diluted basis prior full year guidance was to equal 170 per share or higher on a fullydiluted basis we are uncertain of the trajectory of the economic recovery both in the united states and globally for the balance of the year and on into 2011 as noted above significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our primary markets and geographies would adversely impact our anticipated annual revenues and financial performance 

 

this outlook is based on several variables first our guidance anticipates modest organic revenue gains in our businesses as a whole in the lowtomid single digit range as a result of overall market conditions which we expect to bring our total revenue to approximately 28 billion for the full year second based upon that 

revenue expectation we project net earnings of 175 to 190 per share as a result of higher operating margins due to carryover of productivity gains from our restructuring projects in 2009 and favorable commodities pricing in the first half of 2010 offset somewhat by reinstatement of certain employee benefits and wage increases and higher spending on research and development and sales and marketing resources third we believe our tax rate and pension expense will be slightly higher than in 2009 with some reduction in interest expense as a result of lower borrowing levels and continuing low interest rates we also believe that should we experience volume gains in excess of those we are projecting we will be able to convert those extra revenues into operating income at an approximate 40 rate consistent with our productivity assumptions 

 

our guidance assumes an absence of significant acquisitions or divestitures in 2010 we continue to look for smaller acquisitions to expand our geographic reach internationally expand our presence in our various channels to market and acquire technologies and products to broaden our businesses’ capabilities to serve additional markets we may also consider the divestiture or closure of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their most attractive markets 

 

the ability to achieve our operating objectives and 2010 guidance will depend to a certain extent on factors outside our control see “risk factors” under part i of this report

gain on sale of interest in subsidiaries 

 

on june 28 2008 we entered into a transaction with ge that was accounted for as an acquisition of an 801 percent ownership interest in ge’s global water softener and residential water filtration business in exchange for a 199 percent interest in our global water softener and residential water filtration business the acquisition was effected through the formation of two new entities a us entity and an international entity into which we and ge contributed certain assets properties liabilities and operations representing our respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses we are an 801 percent owner of the new entities and ge is a 199 percent owner the acquisition and related sale of our 199 percent interest resulted in a gain of 1096 million representing the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the 199 percent interest sold 

 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

 

on july 8 2008 we commenced a cash tender offer for all of our outstanding 250 million aggregate principal 785 senior notes due 2009 the “notes” upon expiration of the tender offer on august 4 2008 we purchased 1161 million aggregate principal amount of the notes as a result of this transaction we recognized a loss of 46 million on early extinguishment of debt in 2008 the loss included the write off of 01 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of 06 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash paid of 51 million related to the tender premium and other costs associated with the purchase 

 

on march 16 2009 we announced the redemption of all of our remaining outstanding 1339 million aggregate principal of notes the notes were redeemed on april 15 2009 at a redemption price of 103588 per 1000 of principal outstanding plus accrued interest thereon as a result of this transaction we recognized a loss of 48 million on early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2009 the loss included the 

write off of 01 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of 03 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash paid of 50 million related to the redemption and other costs associated with the purchase

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings we have grown our businesses in significant part over the past few years through acquisitions such as jung pump and porous media in 2007 financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time by private or public debt issuance our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions these are temporary loans that have in the past been repaid within less than a year 

 

in light of the current uncertain economic situation we do not currently plan to make any significant acquisitions in 2010 although we may undertake smaller acquisitions for the second year in a row our board did not authorize our annual share repurchase program that we had undertaken prior to 2009 we continue to focus on increasing our cash flow and maximizing debt repayment for the foreseeable future our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 

 

our current 800 million multicurrency revolving credit facility the “credit facility” was entered into in the second quarter of 2007 and does not expire until june 4 2012 the agent banks under the credit facility are jp morgan bank of america wells fargo us bank and bank of tokyomitsubishi we have ample borrowing capacity for our currently projected needs 6017 million at december 31 2009 which would be limited to 3902 million based on the credit agreement’s leverage ratio covenant 

 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2584 million in 2009 or 542 million higher than in 2008 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a reduction in working capital offset by a discretionary pension contribution of 25 million and lower income from continuing operations 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 2042 million in 2008 or 1371 million lower than in 2007 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an increase in working capital higher prepaid expenses particularly prepaid taxes and lower income from continuing operations excluding the gain from the formation of prf 

 

in december 2008 and 2007 we sold approximately 44 million and 50 million respectively of a customer’s account receivable to a thirdparty financial institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows in 2008 and 2007 a loss in the amount of 05 million and 12 million respectively related to the sale of accounts receivable and is included in the line item other in our consolidated statements of income we did not undertake a similar sale of customer receivables in 2009 in part because of lower receivable balances and higher transactions costs 

 

investing activities 

capital expenditures in 2009 2008 and 2007 were 541 million 531 million and 615 million respectively we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 to be approximately 55 to 65 million primarily for capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing facilities new product development and general maintenance capital 

 

on may 7 2007 we acquired as part of our technical products group the assets of calmark corporation “calmark” a privately held business for 284 million including a cash payment of 292 million and transaction costs of 02 million less cash acquired of 10 million 

 

on april 30 2007 we acquired as part of our water group all of the capital interests in porous media two privately held filtration and separation technologies businesses for 2249 million including a cash payment of 2250 million and transaction costs of 04 million less cash acquired of 05 million 

 

on february 2 2007 we acquired as part of our water group all the outstanding shares of capital stock of jung pump for 2295 million including a cash payment of 2396 million and transaction costs of 13 million less cash acquired of 114 million 

 

on december 15 2008 we sold our spabath business to balboa water group in a cash transaction for 92 million the results of spabath have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of spabath have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

on february 28 2008 we sold our npt business to pool corporation in a cash transaction for 298 million the results of npt have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of npt have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 12 million in 2009 was related to various asset dispositions cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 47 million in 2008 was primarily 

related to the sale of a facility in our water group cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 52 million in 2007 was primarily related to the sale of a facility used by our technical products group 

 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 2091 million in 2009 and 2172 in 2008 versus net cash provided by financing activities of 2227 in 2007 the difference in cash usage between 2009 and 2008 was primarily the result of debt repayments in 2008 the difference in cash usage between 2008 and 2007 was primarily attributable to three acquisitions in 2007 other financing activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business payments of dividends cash used to repurchase company stock cash received from stock option exercises and tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

 

the credit facility creates an unsecured committed revolving credit facility of up to 800 million with multicurrency sub facilities to support investments outside the us the credit facility expires on june 4 2012 borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the rate of libor plus 0625 interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings we believe that internally generated funds and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to support our normal operations dividend payments stock repurchases if and when authorized and debt maturities over the life of the credit facility 

 

we are authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility we use the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding our use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the relative interest rates for our paper compared to the cost of borrowing under our credit facility as of december 31 2009 we had no outstanding commercial paper as of december 31 2008 we had 02 million of commercial paper outstanding all of the commercial paper at december 31 2008 was classified as longterm as we had the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility 

 

in may 2007 we entered into a note purchase agreement with various institutional investors the “agreement” for the sale of 300 million aggregate principal amount of our 587 senior notes “fixed notes” and 105 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes “floating notes” and with the fixed notes the “notes” the fixed notes are due in may 2017 the floating notes are due in may 2012 and bear interest equal to the 3 month libor plus 050 the agreement contains customary events of default 

 

we used 250 million of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to retire a 250 million 364day term loan agreement that we entered into in april 2007 which we used in part to pay the cash purchase price of our porous media acquisition which closed in april 2007 

 

on july 8 2008 we commenced a cash tender offer for all of our outstanding 250 million aggregate principal of notes upon expiration of the tender offer on august 4 2008 we purchased 1161 million aggregate principal amount of the notes as a result of this transaction we recognized a loss of 46 million on early extinguishment of debt in 2008 the loss included the write off of 01 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of 06 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash paid of 51 million related to the tender premium and other costs associated with the purchase 

 

on march 16 2009 we announced the redemption of all of our remaining outstanding 1339 million aggregate principle of notes to take advantage of lower interest rates available under the credit facility the notes were redeemed on april 15 2009 at a redemption price of 103588 per 1000 of principal outstanding plus accrued interest thereon utilizing funds on hand and drawings under our credit facility no other significant debt obligations mature until 2012 as a result of this transaction we recognized a loss of 48 million on early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2009 the loss included the write off of 01 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of 03 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash paid of 50 million related to the redemption and other costs associated with the purchase 

 

our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants the most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio total consolidated indebtedness as defined over consolidated ebitda as defined that may not exceed 35 to 10 we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of december 31 2009 

 

in addition to the credit facility we have 400 million of uncommitted credit facilities under which we had 21 million of borrowings as of december 31 2009 

 

our current credit ratings are as follows 

 

 

 

our longterm debt rating is an investment grade rating investment grade is a credit rating of bbb or higher by standard  poor’s or baa3 or higher by moody’s 

 

on march 6 2009 standard  poor’s “sp” lowered our credit rating from bbb to bbb and changed the outlook from negative to stable sp’s rating action reflects their expectation that the difficult global economic environment will likely delay improvement in our credit metrics resulting in metrics that are more consistent with a bbb rating on may 1 2009 moody’s investors service affirmed its baa3 rating and changed the outlook from stable to negative our credit rating continues to be an investment grade rating which is a credit rating of bbb or higher by sp and baa3 or higher by moody’s 

 

we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not material to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 

 

we issue shortterm commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard  poor’s or moody’s even though our shortterm commercial paper is unrated we believe a downgrade in our longterm debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 

 

we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our longterm debt by either standard  poor’s or moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the longterm debt capital markets however depending upon market conditions the amount timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected if both of our longterm debt ratings were downgraded to below bbbbaa3 our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 

 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders annually we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

 

we paid dividends in 2009 of 709 million compared with 673 million in 2008 and 599 million in 2007 we recently announced an increase in our dividend rate for 2010 from 072 per share in 2009 to 076 per share in 2010 which is the 34th consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend 

 

in december 2007 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock during 2008 up to a maximum dollar limit of 50 million as of december 31 2008 we had purchased 1549893 shares for 50 million pursuant to this authorization this authorization expired on december 31 2008 no authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock was sought from or granted by our board for 2009 or 2010 

 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

 

 

 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2009 variable interest rate debt including the effects of derivative financial instruments was 2005 million at a weighted average interest rate of 090 

 

the estimated annual pension plan contribution amounts are intended to achieve fully funded status of our domestic qualified pension plan in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 

 

pension and post retirement plan contributions are based on an assumed discount rate of 60 for all periods and an expected rate of return on plan assets ranging from 60 to 85 in december 2009 we made a discretionary contribution of 25 million to our defined benefit pension plan 

 

the total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at december 31 2009 is estimated to be approximately 300 million we record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in provision for income taxes and net interest expense  respectively which is consistent with our past practices as of december 31 2009 we had recorded approximately 06 million for the possible payment of penalties and 55 million related to the possible payment of interest 

 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 conversion of net income free cash flow and conversion of net income are nongaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt in addition free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing operations 

 

 

 

in 2010 our objective is to generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 conversion of net income 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2009 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

 

commitments and contingencies 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or prp in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with gaap in the united states as of december 31 2009 and 2008 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 23 million and 31 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

standby letters of credit 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs and certain legal matters as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 512 million and 645 million respectively 

 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

 

impairment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased 

 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 

 

the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publiclytraded companies that are similar in size and industry actual results may differ from those used in our valuations 

 

in developing our discounted cash flow analysis assumptions about future revenues and expenses capital expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and long term business plan for each of our reporting units these plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience anticipated future economic conditions changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in these assumptions are determined over a five year long term planning period the five year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting 

unit being evaluated revenues and operating profit beyond 2016 are projected to grow at a 3 perpetual growth rate for all reporting units 

 

discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weightedaverage cost of capital we utilized a discount rate ranging from 12 to 13 in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis 

 

in estimating fair value using the market approach we identify a group of comparable publiclytraded companies for each operating segment that are similar in terms of size and product offering these groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total marketbased invested capital as a multiple of earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda we determine our estimated values by applying these comparable ebitda multiples to the operating results of our reporting units the ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods 

 

indefinitelived intangibles 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks and trade names patents noncompete agreements proprietary technology and customer relationships identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant during the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2008 we completed our annual impairment test for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization and recorded impairment charges of 113 million and 10 million respectively these charges were recorded in selling general and administrative in our consolidated statements of income 

 

the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value fair value is measured using the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital the impairment charge was the result of significant declines in sales volume 

 

at december 31 2009 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately 25752 million and represented approximately 658 of our total assets if we experience further declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet our operating forecasts we may be subject to future impairments additionally changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses increases in the discount rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price or the market as a whole could result in additional impairment indicators because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets 

 

pension 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions 

including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 12 to the notes to consolidated financial statements changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense pension contributions and the funded status of our pension plans 

 

we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in our balance sheet with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 

 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a discount rate for our us plans of 600 in 2009 and 650 in 2008 and 2007 the discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 200 to 60 in 2009 200 to 625 in 2008 and 200 to 525 in 2007 there are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2010 

 

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2009 equaled 85 which remained unchanged from 2008 and 2007 the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices 

 

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyearperiod the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement in this case we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are at variable interest rates of 3 month libor plus 50 for 105 million of debt and 3 month libor plus 60 for 100 million of debt additionally failure of one or all of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio excluding impact of swap agreements as of december 31 2009 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 50 fixedrate debt and 50 

variablerate debt not considering the effects of our interest rate swaps taking into account the variable to fixed rate swap agreements we entered with an effective date of april 2006 and august 2007 our debt portfolio is comprised of 75 fixedrate debt and 25 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

 

based on the fixedrate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2009 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 200 million increase or decrease in fair value 

 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2009 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 20 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar

customers 

 

our water group distributes its products through wholesale distributors retail distributors original equipment manufacturers home centers and home and pool builders information regarding significant customers in our water group is contained in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

 

seasonality 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including 

extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

 

competition 

our water group faces numerous domestic and international competitors some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the markets in which we compete consolidation globalization and outsourcing are continuing trends in the water industry competition in commercial and residential flow technologies markets focuses on brand names product performance quality and price while home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps they are not important for commercial pumps for municipal pumps competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications service and price competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses on product performance and design quality delivery and price for pool equipment competition focuses on brand names product performance quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing market penetration

competition 

competition in the technical products markets can be intense particularly in telecom and datacom markets where product design prototyping global supply price competition and customer service are significant factors our technical products group has continued to focus on cost control and improving profitability recent growth in the technical products group is a result of new products development overall market growth continued channel penetration growth in targeted market segments geographic expansion price increases and acquisitions consolidation globalization and outsourcing are visible trends in the technical products marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier we believe our technical products group has the broadest array of enclosures products available for commercial and industrial uses 

 

recent developments 

growth of our business 

we continually look at each of our businesses to determine whether they fit with our strategic vision our primary focus is on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities including international 

markets we seek growth through product and service innovation market expansion and acquisitions acquisitions have played an important part in the growth of our business and while we expect acquisitions to be an important part of our future growth until economic and credit market conditions improve we are not currently planning any significant acquisitions 

 

acquisitions 

on june 28 2008 we entered into a transaction with ge water  process technologies a unit of general electric company “ge” that was accounted for as an acquisition of an 801 percent ownership interest in ge’s global water softener and residential water filtration business in exchange for a 199 percent interest in our global water softener and residential water filtration business the acquisition was effected through the formation of two new entities collectively “pentair residential filtration” or “prf” a us entity and an international entity into which we and ge contributed certain assets properties liabilities and operations representing our respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses we are an 801 percent owner of the new entities and ge is a 199 percent owner 

 

with the formation of this business we believe prf will be better positioned to serve residential customers with industryleading technical applications in the areas of water conditioning wholehouse filtration point of use water management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate revenue growth by selling ge’s existing residential conditioning products through our sales channels 

 

on may 7 2007 we acquired as part of our technical products group the assets of calmark corporation “calmark” a privately held business calmark’s product portfolio includes enclosures guides card locks retainers extractors card pullers and other products for the aerospace medical telecommunications and military market segments among others

information regarding all business segments 

 

backlog 

our backlog of orders as of december 31 by segment was 

 

 

 

the 211 million increase in water group backlog was primarily due to increased backlog for pumps used in industrial and municipal market applications and growth in asian markets partially offset by declining market conditions in residential pool and pump markets the 132 million decrease in technical products group backlog reflected declining market conditions in both our electrical and electronic markets due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry practice for the majority of our businesses backlog which typically represents less than 60 days of shipments is not deemed to be a significant item a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month we expect that most of our backlog at december 31 2008 will be filled in 2009 

 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in our own facilities which consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2008 2007 and 2006 were 625 million 568 million and 565 million respectively 

 

environmental 

 

environmental matters are discussed in item 3 item 7 and in item 8 note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

 

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the manufacturing of our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

 

the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages todate due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with escalator  deescalator clauses prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may trend higher in the future 

 

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trade mark trade name or brand name 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the termination of patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

employees 

as of december 31 2008 we employed approximately 14700 people worldwide total employees in the united states were approximately 8000 of whom approximately 850 are represented by five different trade unions having collective bargaining agreements generally labor relations have been satisfactory 

 

captive insurance subsidiary 

we insure certain general and product liability property workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary penwald insurance company “penwald” reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses prepenwald liabilities and those of certain foreign operations are established without regard to the availability of insurance

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements you should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties if any of the risks described below actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in that case the price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to other information set forth in this document 

 

general economic conditions including difficult credit and residential construction markets affect demand for our products 

 

we compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets among these the most significant are global industrial and commercial markets for both the water and technical products groups and residential markets for the water group the global credit crisis and recession have adversely affected the robustness of our markets as exemplified in the fourth quarter of 2008 important factors for our businesses include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and governmental capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing for our customers and endusers and interest rates new construction for residential housing and home improvement activity fell dramatically in both 2007 and 2008 which reduced revenue growth in each of the businesses within our water group we believe that weakness in this market and the recent dramatic slowdown in our industrial and commercial markets will 

likely continue to affect our revenues and margins throughout 2009 any continuing weakness in these markets beyond 2009 will negatively affect our sales and financial performance in future periods 

 

our inability to sustain consistent organic growth or limit revenue decreases could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

over the past three years our organic growth was generated in part from expanding international sales entering new distribution channels price increases and introducing new products to grow more rapidly than our end markets we would have to continue to expand our geographic reach further diversify our distribution channels continue to introduce new products and increase sales of existing products to our customer base difficult economic and competitive factors adversely affected our ability to sustain consistent organic growth in 2008 as revenues contracted in the fourth quarter as a result of these economic conditions that adversely impacted our anticipated financial performance we did not meet our stated revenue growth targets in the fourth quarter and for the year 2008 we believe that our revenues will continue to decline as our markets weaken rather than focus our efforts primarily on broadbased revenue growth we have chosen to limit our growth initiatives to specific end markets and geographies we cannot assure you that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets 

 

our businesses operate in highly competitive markets so we may be forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs 

 

our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of their respective markets competition may force us to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive we compete on the basis of product design quality availability performance customer service and price present or future competitors may have greater financial technical or other resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected business or businesses we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 

 

material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations 

 

over the past few years we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals and resins energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance while these inflationary pressures have begun to abate in late 2008 and early 2009 as a result of general economic conditions we may not be able to recognize the full benefit from this moderating or reversal of material cost and other inflation in addition the recent reversal of material cost inflation may not be sustainable once the economy begins to strengthen we also are continuing to implement our excellence in operations initiatives in order to continuously reduce our costs we cannot assure you however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts we cannot assure you that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

intellectual property challenges may hinder product development and marketing 

 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products 

 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

 

our business exposes us to potential litigation such as product liability claims relating to the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

reductions in our acquisition activity will likely slow our revenue growth or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

 

over the past four years much of our growth has resulted from acquisitions of businesses within our current business segments while we intend to continue to evaluate acquisitions in these segments given the current financial and economic environment we currently do not expect to make significant acquisitions until credit markets and business conditions stabilize we cannot assure you that we would be able to continue to grow or to limit revenue declines without making acquisitions acquisitions we may undertake could have a material adverse effect on our operating results particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisitions while we attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our operations once integrated acquired operations may not achieve the levels of profitability originally anticipated 

 

the availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on our financial performance 

 

our plans to vigorously compete in our chosen markets will require additional capital for future acquisitions capital expenditures growth of working capital and continued international and regional expansion in the past we have financed growth of our businesses primarily through cash from operations and debt financing while we refinanced our primary credit agreements in the second quarter of 2007 on what we believe to be favorable terms future acquisitions or other uses of funds may require us to expand our debt financing resources or to issue equity securities our financial results may be adversely affected if new financing is not available on favorable terms or if interest costs under our debt financings are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other internal growth in addition future acquisitions could be dilutive to your equity investment if we issue additional stock as consideration we cannot assure you that we will be able to issue equity securities or obtain future debt financing at favorable terms without sufficient financing we will not be able to pursue our targeted growth strategy and our acquisition program which will limit our revenue growth and future financial performance 

 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

 

sales outside of the united states including export sales from our domestic businesses accounted for approximately 35 of our gross sales in 2008 up from 32 in 2007 further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from foreign suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 

 10 

 

  

our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

 

our international operations are subject to foreign market and currency fluctuation risks 

 

we expect the percentage of our sales outside of north america to increase in the future over the past few years the economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do business have had slower growth than the us economy the european union currently accounts for the majority of our foreign sales and income in which our most significant european market is germany each market area is currently experiencing similar economic difficulties to those in the united states and sales in those markets slowed significantly by the end of 2008 in addition we have a significant and growing business in the asiapacific area but the economic conditions in countries in this region are subject to different growth expectations market weaknesses and business practices we cannot predict how changing market conditions in these regions will impact our financial results 

 

we are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results in 2008 the weakness of the us dollar slightly benefited our financial results in foreign jurisdictions we do not anticipate continuing us dollar weakness in foreign exchange markets in 2009 of a similar magnitude which may hurt our financial results on a comparative basis in addition we source certain products components and raw materials throughout the world the import of which into the united states has raised the cost of these goods in us dollars and has impacted the results of our domestic businesses as well 

 

we have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative impact on our financial results 

 

we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as required by statement of accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas no 142 by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on our balance sheet at december 31 2008 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately 26174 million and represented approximately 646 of our total assets while our annual assessment in 2008 did not indicate an impairment of goodwill at that time longterm declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with these environmental health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the 

cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require 

 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses we have also made claims against third parties for indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental remediations or other obligations we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for such costs 

 

we cannot ensure you that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

provisions of our restated articles of incorporation bylaws and minnesota law could deter takeover attempts 

 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents under minnesota law and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor 

 

our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions relating to the election appointment and removal of directors as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting requirements which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control in addition our common share purchase rights could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us which could deter some acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers also the minnesota business corporations act contains control share acquisition and business combination provisions which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control our shareholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

 

we comply with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 accounting for contingencies and related guidance and record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be reasonably estimated factors that are considered when determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met include the a nature of the litigation claim or assessment b progress of the case including progress after the date of the financial statements but before the issuance date of the financial statements c opinions of legal counsel and d management’s intended response to the litigation claim or assessment where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range we record the most likely estimate of the loss when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount however the minimum amount in the range is accrued gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 

 

while we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “legal proceedings” could change in the future

we have been named as defendants targets or prp in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 which relate to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2008 and 2007 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 31 million and 35 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion 

in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims

overview 

we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets designing and manufacturing standard modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components thermal management products and accessories in 2009 we expect our water group and technical products group to generate approximately 23 and 13 of total revenues respectively 

 

our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately 125 million in 1995 to approximately 22 billion in 2008 we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target market totaling 60 billion our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water 

 

on february 28 2008 we sold our national pool tile “npt” business to pool corporation in a cash transaction the results of npt have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of npt have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

on june 28 2008 we entered into a transaction with ge water  process technologies a unit of general electric company “ge” that was accounted for as an acquisition of an 801 percent ownership interest in ge’s global water softener and residential water filtration business in exchange for a 199 percent interest in our global water softener and residential water filtration business the acquisition was effected through the formation of two new entities collectively “pentair residential filtration” or “prf” a us entity and an international entity into which we and ge contributed certain assets properties liabilities and operations representing our respective global water softener and residential water filtration businesses we are an 801 percent owner of the new entities and ge is a 199 percent owner 

 

with the formation of pentair residential filtration we believe we will be better positioned to serve residential customers with industryleading technical applications in the areas of water conditioning whole house filtration point of use water management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate revenue growth by selling ge’s existing residential conditioning products through our sales channels 

 

on december 15 2008 we sold our spa and bath “spabath” business to balboa water group in a cash transaction the results of spabath have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of spabath have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as defense security medical and networking we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america for enclosures and the highest brand recognition in the industry in north america from mid2001 through 2003 the technical products group experienced 

significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and overcapacity and weak demand in the data communication and telecommunication markets from 2004 through 2008 sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors new products price increases and higher demand in targeted markets 

 

key trends and uncertainties 

 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2008 and will likely impact our results in 2009 and beyond 

 

 22 

 

  

outlook 

 

in 2009 our operating objectives include the following 

 

  

on february 3 2009 we announced our results of operations for fiscal year 2008 and modified our earnings guidance for the first quarter of 2009 to a range of 020 to 030 per share on a diluted basis our prior guidance for the first quarter of 2009 given in december 2008 was a range of 030 to 035 per share our 

revised outlook for the quarter is based on what we believe will be a continuation of the order rates and level of economic activity realized in december and january lasting throughout the first quarter 

 

in december 2008 we also initiated earnings guidance for the year 2009 that anticipated our earnings to be approximately 170 to 200 per share on a diluted basis this guidance has not been withdrawn or modified because we do not have sufficient certainty at this time to support any revision we do caution however that we are uncertain of the economic performance trajectory both in the united states and globally for the calendar year as noted above significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our primary markets and geographies beyond what we have seen to date in the first quarter would adversely impact our revenues and financial performance 

 

this outlook is based on several variables first our guidance anticipates revenue declines in our businesses throughout 2009 of approximately 10 as a result of overall market conditions bringing our total revenue to approximately 30 billion for the full year second we expect to get the benefit in the second third and fourth quarters of 2009 of restructuring and other marketrelated expense reduction efforts taken during 2008 and early in 2009 third we anticipate that our manufacturing productivity initiatives in particular our materials sourcing programs will improve through our lean enterprise initiatives and commodity deflation 

 

we have heightened our focus on increasing the conversion of our net income into free cash flow from that achieved in 2008 in addition in response to continuing turbulence in the credit markets we are taking actions we believe will help maintain our liquidity and increase our capital resources by allowing us to repay indebtedness at a faster rate than would otherwise be the case we do not intend to implement our stock buyback program for 2009 as we have in the past nor do we currently intend to make any significant cash acquisitions until credit markets and business conditions stabilize 

 

if economic conditions worsen in north america and europe then we expect that our sales manufacturing productivity and cash flow may deteriorate from the current forecast in that event we would further reduce discretionary capital spending and selling marketing and rd costs as well as accelerate our restructuring actions in order to minimize the impact of these declines on our earnings per share conversely if economic conditions hold up and improve over the year we would then have the flexibility to increase expenditures in our selling marketing and rd efforts to maximize organic sales growth in favorable markets in 2009 and to anticipate growth in 2010 

 

our guidance assumes an absence of significant acquisitions or divestitures in 2009 in 2009 we may seek to expand our geographic reach internationally expand our presence in our various channels to market and acquire technologies and products to broaden our businesses’ capabilities to serve additional markets we may also consider the divestiture or closure of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their most attractive markets 

 

the ability to achieve our operating objectives and 2009 guidance will depend to a certain extent on factors outside our control see “risk factors” under part i of this report

on july 8 2008 we commenced a cash tender offer for all of our outstanding 250 million aggregate principal 785 senior notes due 2009 the “notes” upon expiration of the tender offer on august 4 2008 we purchased 1161 million aggregate principal amount of the notes as a result of this transaction we recognized a loss of 46 million on early extinguishment of debt the loss included the write off of 01 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of 06 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash paid of 51 million related to the tender premium and other costs associated with the purchase

we expect our full year effective tax rate in 2009 to be between 32 and 33 we will continue to pursue tax rate reduction opportunities 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

we generally fund cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings we have grown our businesses in significant part over the past few years through acquisitions such as jung pump and porous media in 2007 financed by credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time by private or public debt issuance our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes although we have negotiated additional credit facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions these are temporary loans that have in the past been repaid within less than a year 

 

in light of the current global economic situation and the state of credit markets generally we have instituted a more conservative financial policy we do not currently plan to make any significant acquisitions in 2009 and we do not plan to continue in 2009 the annual share repurchase programs that we have undertaken over the 

past few years we are focusing on increasing our cash flow and maximizing debt repayment for the foreseeable future our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position 

 

we previously had a targeted debttototalcapital ratio of 40 which could and had been exceeded from time to time as needed for operational purposes and especially acquisitions our capital structure as of december 31 2008 consisted of 9541 million in total indebtedness and 18987 million in shareholders’ equity the ratio of debttototal capital was 334 percent compared with 357 percent at yearend 2007 and 308 percent in 2006 in line with our new financial policy we no longer target a particular debttototalcapital ratio but we will strive to maintain our investment grade ratings 

 

our current 800 million multicurrency revolving credit facility the “credit facility” was entered into in the second quarter of 2007 and does not expire until june 4 2012 the agent banks under the credit facility are j p morgan bank of america wells fargo u s bank and bank of tokyomitsubishi we have borrowing capacity of over 580 million at december 31 2008 and the only significant required debt repayment before 2012 is for the retirement in october 2009 of the remaining 785 senior notes originally issued in 1999 of which approximately 134 million are currently outstanding 

 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group we generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational purposes which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2042 million in 2008 or 1371 million lower compared with the same period in 2007 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an increase in working capital higher prepaid expenses particularly prepaid taxes and lower income from continuing operations excluding the gain from the formation of prf 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 3413 million in 2007 or 1098 million higher compared with the same period in 2006 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to working capital reductions during 2007 versus 2006 and higher net income 

 

in december 2008 and 2007 we sold approximately 44 million and 50 million respectively of a customer’s account receivable to a thirdparty financial institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas’ no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows in 2008 and 2007 a loss in the amount of 05 million and 12 million related to the sale of accounts receivable is included in the line item other in our consolidated statements of income 

 

investing activities 

capital expenditures in 2008 2007 and 2006 were 531 million 615 million and 509 million respectively we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2009 to be approximately 45 to 50 million primarily for capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing facilities new product development and general maintenance capital 

 

on may 7 2007 we acquired as part of our technical products group the assets of calmark corporation “calmark” a privately held business for 284 million including a cash payment of 292 million and transaction costs of 02 million less cash acquired of 10 million 

 

on april 30 2007 we acquired as part of our water group all of the capital interests in porous media two privately held filtration and separation technologies businesses for 2249 million including a cash payment of 2250 million and transaction costs of 04 million less cash acquired of 05 million 

 

on february 2 2007 we acquired as part of our water group all the outstanding shares of capital stock of jung pump for 2295 million including a cash payment of 2396 million and transaction costs of 13 million less cash acquired of 114 million 

 

on december 15 2008 we sold our spabath business to balboa water group in a cash transaction for approximately 83 million subject to certain price adjustments based on working capital at closing the results of spabath have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of spabath have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

on february 28 2008 we sold our npt business to pool corporation in a cash transaction for approximately 300 million subject to certain price adjustments the results of npt have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of npt have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

 

cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 47 million in 2008 was primarily related to the sale of a facility in our water group cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 52 million in 2007 was primarily related to the sale of a facility used by our technical products group 

 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 2172 million in 2008 versus net cash provided by financing activities of 2227 in 2007 the difference in cash usage between the two years is primarily attributable to the three acquisitions in 2007 other financing activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business payments of dividends cash used to repurchase company stock cash received from stock option exercises and tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

 

the credit facility creates an unsecured committed revolving credit facility of up to 800 million with multicurrency sub facilities to support investments outside the us the credit facility expires on june 4 2012 borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the rate of libor plus 050 interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings we believe that internally generated funds and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to support our normal operations dividend payments stock repurchases if authorized and debt maturities over the life of the credit facility 

 

we are authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility we use the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding our use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the relative interest rates for our commercial paper compared to the cost of borrowing under our credit facility as of december 31 2008 we had 02 million of commercial paper outstanding that matures within 41 days all of the commercial paper was classified as longterm as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility 

 

in may 2007 we entered into a note purchase agreement with various institutional investors the “agreement” for the sale of 300 million aggregate principal amount of our 587 senior notes “fixed notes” and 105 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes “floating notes” and with the fixed notes the “notes” the fixed notes are due in may 2017 the floating notes are due in may 2012 and bear interest equal to the 3 month libor plus 050 the agreement contains customary events of default 

 

we used 250 million of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to retire a 250 million 364day term loan agreement that we entered into in april 2007 which we used in part to pay the cash purchase price of our porous media acquisition which closed in april 2007 

 

our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants the most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio total consolidated indebtedness as defined over consolidated ebitda as defined that may not exceed 35 to 10 we were in compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of december 31 2008 

 

in addition to the credit facility we have 250 million of uncommitted credit facilities under which we had no borrowings as of december 31 2008 

 

our current credit ratings are as follows 

 

 

 

our longterm debt rating is an investment grade rating investment grade is a credit rating of bbb or higher by standard  poor’s or baa3 or higher by moody’s 

 

on march 7 2007 standard  poor’s ratings services revised its current rating outlook on us from stable to negative at the same time standard  poor’s affirmed its longterm debt rating of ‘bbb’ standard  poor’s stated that the outlook revision reflects the additional leverage and stress on credit metrics that would result from the acquisition of porous media the negative outlook indicates the rating could be lowered if financial policies become more aggressive or if operating results are weaker than expected 

 

we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not material to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 

 

we issue shortterm commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard  poor’s or moody’s even though our shortterm commercial paper is unrated we believe a downgrade in our longterm debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 

 

we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our longterm debt by either standard  poor’s or moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the longterm debt capital markets however depending upon market conditions the amount timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected if both of our longterm debt ratings were downgraded to below bbbbaa3 our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 

 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders in order to meet these cash requirements we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

 

we paid dividends in 2008 of 673 million compared with 599 million in 2007 and 566 million in 2006 we recently announced an increase in our dividend rate for 2009 from 068 per share in 2008 to 072 per share in 2009 which is the 33 rd consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend 

 

in december 2007 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock during 2008 up to a maximum dollar limit of 50 million as of december 31 2008 we had purchased 1549893 shares for 50 million pursuant to this authorization this authorization expired on december 31 2008 no authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock has been granted for 2009 

 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

 

 

 

our longterm debt obligations that are due in 2009 include 1341 million that has been classified as longterm in our consolidated balance sheets as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility 

 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2008 variable interest rate debt including the effects of derivative financial instruments was 2144 million at a weighted average interest rate of 121 

 

pension and postretirement plan contributions are based on an assumed discount rate of 65 for all periods and an expected rate of return on plan assets ranging from 65 to 85 

 

as of december 31 2008 the gross liability for uncertain tax positions under fin 48 is 281 million we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months we are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the noncurrent fin 48 obligations 

 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 conversion of net income free cash flow and conversion of net income are nongaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt in addition free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing operations 

 

 

in 2009 our objective is to generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 of net income 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2008 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements

we have been named as defendants targets or prp in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 which relate to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with gaap in the united states as of december 31 2008 and 2007 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 31 million and 35 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

standby letters of credit 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs and certain legal matters as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 645 million and 585 million respectively 

 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our 

observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

 

impairment of goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased 

 

goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment test is performed using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment if any that should be recorded in the second step an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation the fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis projecting discounted future cash flows requires is to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses projected capital expenditures changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate the projections also take into account several factors including current and estimated economic trends and outlook costs of raw materials consideration of our market capitalization in comparison to the estimated fair values of our reporting units determined using discounted cash flow analyses and other factors which are beyond our control 

 

at december 31 2008 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately 26174 million and represented approximately 646 of our total assets declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible impairments because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 

 

we completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter with each reporting unit’s fair value exceeding its carrying value accordingly step two of the impairment analysis was not required 

 

our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks and trade names brand names patents noncompete agreements proprietary technology and customer relationships under the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount during the fourth quarter of 2008 we completed our annual impairment test for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization and recorded an impairment charge of 10 million the charge was recorded in selling general and administrative in our consolidated statements of income 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying 

value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets 

 

pension 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 12 to the notes to consolidated financial statements changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense pension contributions and the funded status of our pension plans 

 

in december 2006 we adopted sfas no 158 employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in our 2006 yearend balance sheet with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 

 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a discount rate for our us plans of 650 in 2008 and 2007 and 600 in 2006 the discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 200 to 625 in 2008 200 to 525 in 2007 and 200 to 515 in 2006 there are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2009 

 

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2008 equaled 85 which remained unchanged from 2007 and 2006 the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices 

 

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyearperiod the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 

 

see item 8 note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks 

counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion shortterm borrowing and interest rate swaps the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 9239 million and 10765 million respectively 

 

failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement in this case we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are at variable interest rates of 3 month libor plus 50 for 105 million of debt and 3 month libor plus 60 for 100 million of debt additionally failure of one or all of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position 

 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio including swap agreements as of december 31 2008 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars this debt portfolio is comprised of 56 fixedrate debt and 44 variablerate debt not considering the effects of our interest rate swaps taking into account the variable to fixed rate swap agreement we entered with an effective date of april 2006 and august 2007 our debt portfolio is comprised of 78 fixedrate debt and 22 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2008 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 21 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

 

foreign currency risk 

we conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency the us dollar we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks the functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the country of domicile we manage these operating activities at the local level and revenues costs assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange however our results of operations and assets and liabilities are reported in us dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the us dollar

information regarding all business segments 

 

backlog 

our backlog of orders as of december 31 by segment was 

 

 

 

the 687 million increase in water group backlog was primarily due to increased backlog for pumps used in municipal market applications and growth in asian markets the 247 million increase in technical products group backlog reflected growth in our electrical markets recovery in north american electronics markets and growth in asian markets due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry practice for the majority of our businesses backlog which typically represents less than 30 days of shipments is not deemed to be a significant item a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month we expect that most of our backlog at december 31 2007 will be filled in 2008 

 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in our own facilities which consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2007 2006 and 2005 were 588 million 581 million and 460 million respectively 

 

environmental 

environmental matters are discussed in item 3 item 7 and in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

 

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the manufacturing of our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

 

the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages todate due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with escalator  deescalator clauses prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may continue to trend higher in the future 

 

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trade mark trade name or brand name 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the termination of patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision if any of the risks described below actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in that case the price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to other information set forth in this document 

 

general economic conditions including credit and residential construction markets affect demand for our products 

 

we compete globally in varied markets among these the most significant are north american industrial and commercial markets for both the water and technical products groups and the north american residential market for the water group economic conditions in the united states affect the robustness of our north american markets important factors include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and municipal capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets the age of existing housing stock unemployment rates availability of consumer and commercial financing and interest rates new construction for residential housing and home improvement activity fell dramatically in 2007 which reduced revenue growth in our water group especially in the pool and spa and flow technologies markets we address we believe that recent weaknesses in these markets will likely continue to affect our revenues and margins throughout 2008 further while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions we cannot assure you that a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region would not have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our businesses operate in highly competitive markets so we may be forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs 

 

our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of their respective markets competition may force us to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive we compete on the basis of product design quality availability performance customer service and price present or future competitors may have 

greater financial technical or other resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected business or businesses we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 

 

our inability to sustain consistent organic growth could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

in 2007 and 2006 our organic growth was generated in part from expanding international sales entering new distribution channels price increases and introducing new products to grow more rapidly than our end markets we will have to continue to expand our geographic reach further diversify our distribution channels continue to introduce new products and increase sales of existing products to our customer base competitive and economic factors could adversely affect our ability to sustain consistent organic growth if we are unable to sustain consistent organic growth we will be less likely to meet our stated revenue growth targets which together with any resulting impact on our net income growth would likely adversely affect the market price of our stock 

 

our inability to complete or successfully complete and integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

over the past three years we have grown through acquisitions of businesses within our current business segments that have generated a significant percentage of our net revenue growth we may not be able to sustain this level of growth from acquisition activity in the future we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions primarily in our current business segments though we may consider acquisitions outside of these segments as well our ability to expand through acquisitions is subject to various risks including the following 

 

  

acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisitions while we attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our operations once integrated acquired operations may not achieve the levels of profitability originally anticipated 

 

material cost and other inflation could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we are experiencing material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials especially metals energy and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we also are continuing to implement our excellence in operations initiatives in order to continuously reduce our costs we cannot assure you however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations 

 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water 

systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts we cannot assure you that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

intellectual property challenges may hinder product development and marketing 

 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products 

 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

 

our business exposes us to potential litigation especially product liability suits that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products such as the horizon litigation discussed in item 3 and item 8 note 15 of this annual report on form 10k while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on our continued growth 

 

our plans to continue growth in our chosen markets will require additional capital for future acquisitions capital expenditures for existing businesses growth of working capital and continued international and regional expansion in the past we have financed our growth primarily through debt financing while we refinanced our primary credit agreements in the second quarter of 2007 future acquisitions may require us to expand our debt financing resources or to issue equity securities our financial results may be adversely affected if interest costs under our debt financings are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other internal growth in addition future acquisitions could be dilutive to your equity investment if we issue additional stock as consideration there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue equity securities or to obtain future debt financing at favorable terms without sufficient financing we will not be able to pursue our growth strategy especially our acquisition program which will limit our growth and revenues in the future 

 

our international operations are subject to foreign market and currency fluctuation risks 

 

we expect the percentage of our sales outside of north america to increase in the future over the past few years the economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do business have had slower growth than the us economy the european union currently accounts for the majority of our foreign sales and income in which our most significant european market is germany in addition we have a significant and growing business in the asiapacific area we cannot predict how changing market conditions in these regions will impact our financial results 

 

we are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results in 2007 the weakness of the us dollar benefited our financial results in foreign jurisdictions significantly we do not anticipate continuing us dollar weakness in foreign exchange markets in 2008 of a similar magnitude which may hurt our financial results on a comparative basis in addition we source certain products components and raw materials throughout the world the import of which into the united states has raised the cost of these goods in us dollars and has impacted the results of our domestic businesses as well we expect a continuing impact of the weak dollar in 2008 as well although we expect that we should be able to offset this continuing impact through increased focus on our sourcing programs productivity gains in our facilities and other cost reductions 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

 

sales outside of the united states including export sales from our domestic businesses accounted for approximately 32 of our net sales in 2007 up from 27 in 2006 further most of our businesses obtain some products components and raw materials from foreign suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 

  

our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

 

we are exposed to potential environmental and other laws liabilities and litigation 

 

we are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing our environmental practices public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment compliance with environmental regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require 

 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses 

 

we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

provisions of our restated articles of incorporation bylaws and minnesota law could deter takeover attempts 

 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents under minnesota law and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor 

our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions relating to the election appointment and removal of directors as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting requirements which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control in addition our common share purchase rights could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us which could deter some acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers also the minnesota business corporations act contains control share acquisition and business combination provisions which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control our shareholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock

our principal executive office is in leased premises located in golden valley minnesota we carry out our water group manufacturing operations at 19 plants located throughout the united states and at 18 plants located in 10 other countries in addition our water group has 65 distribution facilities and 18 sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the world we carry out our technical products group manufacturing operations at 8 plants located throughout the united states and 11 plants located in 7 other countries in addition our technical products group has 11 distribution facilities and 29 sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the world

tablestart 


 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

 

we comply with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 accounting for contingencies  and related guidance and record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be reasonably estimated factors that are considered when determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met include the a nature of the litigation claim or assessment b progress of the case including progress after the date of the financial statements but before the issuance date of the financial statements c opinions of legal counsel and d management’s intended response to the litigation claim or assessment where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range we record the most likely estimate of the loss when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount however the minimum amount in the range is accrued gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 

 

while we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “legal proceedings” could change in the future 

 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or prp in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims 

have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 which relate to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2007 and 2006 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 35 million and 56 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

 

horizon litigation 

twentyeight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs a class action and claims for indemnity by celebrity cruise lines inc “celebrity” were brought against essef corporation “essef” and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of essef in august 1999 the claims against essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the allegation that essef designed manufactured and marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the spa system on the horizon cruise ship and allegations that the spa and filters contained legionnaire’s disease bacteria that infected certain passengers on cruises in july 1994 

 

the individual and class claims by passengers were tried and resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the part of the essef defendants 70 and celebrity and its sister company fantasia together 30 after expiration of posttrial appeals we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of 70 million in the passenger cases plus interest of approximately 16 million in january 2004 all of the passenger cases have now been resolved through either settlement or judgment 

 

the only remaining unresolved claims in this case were those brought by celebrity for damages resulting from the outbreak celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and costs for prior litigation as well as outofpocket losses lost profits and loss of business enterprise value the first trial in 2006 resulted in a verdict against the essef defendants for celebrity’s outofpocket expenses of 104 million verdicts at this trial for lost profits 476 million and lost enterprise value 135 million were reversed in january 2007 in the retrial in june 2007 the jury awarded celebrity damages for lost profits for 1994 and 1995 of 152 million 

after netting for amounts taken into account by the earlier verdict for outofpocket expenses the verdicts are exclusive of prejudgment interest and attorneys’ fees 

 

in january 2008 the district court ruled on posttrial motions and other previously undecided issues in this litigation our motion to reverse the jury verdict in the second trial on lost profits after 1994 was not granted celebrity’s damages for outofpocket costs and lost profits were reduced by 30 reflecting an earlier finding of its contributory negligence and prejudgment interest was awarded to celebrity at a rate equal to semiannual tbill rates compounded annually in addition celebrity and the essef defendants settled celebrity’s claim for attorneys’ fees in the passenger cases for 3 million inclusive of all interest this amount was paid and expensed in the fourth quarter of 2007 

 

in the aggregate damages against the essef defendants in this litigation total approximately 305 million inclusive of interest through 2007 judgment on the verdicts has not yet been entered once entered both parties will have thirty days in which to appeal from the judgment the essef defendants have not yet determined whether and on what issues they may appeal in this case 

 

we have assessed the impact of the latest ruling on our previously established reserves for this matter and based on information available at this time have not changed our reserves except to take into account appropriate interest accruals 

 

we believe that any judgment we pay in this matter would be taxdeductible in the year paid or in subsequent years in addition to the impact of any loss on this matter on our earnings per share when recognized we may need to borrow funds from our banks or other sources to pay any judgment plus interest upon settlement or finally determined after exhaustion of all appeals

overview 

we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets designing and manufacturing standard modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components thermal management products and accessories in 2008 we expect our water group and technical products group to generate approximately 70 and 30 of total revenues respectively 

 

our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately 125 million in 1995 to approximately 23 billion in 2007 we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target market totaling 60 billion our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water 

 

our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as defense security medical and networking we believe we have the largest enclosures industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and the highest enclosures brand recognition in the industry in north america from mid2001 through 2003 the technical products group experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and overcapacity and weak demand in the datacommunication and telecommunication markets from 2004 through 2007 sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors new products and higher demand in targeted markets 

 

key trends and uncertainties 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2007 and will likely impact our results in the future 

 

 23 

  

  

outlook 

in 2008 our operating objectives include the following 

 

  

on february 5 2008 we reaffirmed our previously issued fiscal 2008 guidance which anticipates our earnings per share growth between 8 and 15 to approximately 225 to 240 per share our estimate is based on three primary variables first we anticipate modest organic growth in the range of 3 to 5 including some price and product mix improvements bringing our total revenues to 35 to 36 billion for the full year second we anticipate that our manufacturing productivity initiatives in particular our materials sourcing programs will improve through our lean enterprise initiatives and through somewhat higher unit volumes third we anticipate our selling marketing and rd expenses will flex with economic conditions in our primary markets 

if economic conditions worsen in north america and europe then we expect that our sales and productivity increases may deteriorate from current forecast in that event we would reduce discretionary selling marketing and rd costs in order to minimize the impact of these declines on our earnings per share which we anticipate would still meet the bottom of our guidance range conversely if economic conditions hold up and improve over the year we expect our net income should be able to reach the top of our guidance range we would then have the flexibility to increase expenditures in our selling marketing and rd efforts to maximize organic sales growth in 2008 and sustain anticipated growth in 2009 

 

we based our guidance on an absence of significant acquisitions or divestitures in 2008 as noted above in 2008 our objectives may seek to expand our geographic reach internationally expand our presence in our various channels to market and acquire technologies and products to broaden our businesses’ capabilities to serve additional markets we may also consider the divestiture of discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their most attractive markets 

 

the ability to achieve our operating objectives and 2008 guidance will depend to a certain extent on factors outside our control see “risk factors” under part i of this report

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments dividend payments and share repurchases are generally funded from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings in 2007 we invested 488 million in acquisitions repurchased 41 million of our stock and paid 60 million in dividends 

 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

the following table presents selected working capital measurements calculated from our monthly operating results based on a 13month moving average 

 

 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 3419 million in 2007 or 1103 million higher compared with the same period in 2006 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to working capital reductions during 2007 versus 2006 and higher net income in the future we expect our working capital ratios to improve as we continue to capitalize on our pims initiatives 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 2316 million in 2006 or 162 million lower compared with the same period in 2005 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to working capital increases related to increased inventory levels and decreases in various accruals the increase in days inventory on hand as of december 31 2006 compared to december 31 2005 was attributable to increased inventory levels to support product moves and plant rationalizations inventory to support product sourced from low cost countries higher value of inventories due to rising raw material input costs and due to the purchase of additional submersible pump motors for competitive reasons 

 

in december 2007 and 2006 we sold approximately 50 million and 30 million respectively of accounts receivable to a thirdparty financial institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk because we did not offer or the customer did not take advantage of the early pay discounts in compliance with sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows in 2007 and 2006 a loss in the amount of 12 million and 08 million related to the sale of accounts receivable is included in the line item gainloss on sale of assets net in our consolidated statements of income

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 2227 million in 2007 versus a cash use of 1178 million and 438 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in 2007 primarily relates to the additional borrowings to fund the jung pumpen and porous media acquisitions financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from debt issuances and draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business dividend payments share repurchases cash received from stock option exercises and tax benefits related to stockbased compensation 

 

in june 2007 we entered into an amended and restated multicurrency revolving credit facility the “credit facility” the credit facility creates an unsecured committed revolving credit facility of up to 800 million with multicurrency subfacilities to support investment outside the us the credit facility expires june 4 2012 borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at the rate of libor plus 050 interest rates and fees under the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings 

 

we are authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility we use the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2007 we had 1060 million of commercial paper outstanding that matures within 71 days all of the commercial paper was classified as longterm as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility 

 

in may 2007 we entered into a note purchase agreement with various institutional investors the “agreement” for the sale of 300 million aggregate principal amount of our 587 senior notes “fixed notes” and 105 million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes “floating notes” and with the fixed notes the “notes” the fixed notes are due in may 2017 the floating notes are due in may 2012 and bear interest equal to the 3 month libor plus 050 the agreement contains customary events of default 

we used 250 million of the proceeds from the sale of the notes to retire a 250 million 364day term loan agreement that we entered into in april 2007 which we used in part to pay the cash purchase price of our porous media acquisition which closed in april 2007 

 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december 31 2007 

 

in addition to the credit facility we have 297 million of uncommitted credit facilities under which we had drawn 135 million in borrowings as of december 31 2007 

 

our current credit ratings are as follows 

 

 

 

on march 7 2007 standard  poor’s ratings services revised its current rating outlook on us from stable to negative at the same time standard  poor’s affirmed its longterm debt rating of ’bbb’ standard  poor’s stated that the outlook revision reflects the additional leverage and stress on credit metrics that would result from the acquisition of porous media the negative outlook indicates the rating could be lowered if financial policies become more aggressive or if operating results are weaker than expected 

 

we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 

 

we issue shortterm commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard  poor’s or moody’s even though our shortterm commercial paper is unrated we believe a downgrade in our longterm debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 

 

we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our longterm debt by either standard  poor’s or moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets however depending upon market conditions the amount timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected if both of our longterm debt ratings were downgraded to below bbbbaa3 our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced 

 

as of december 31 2007 our capital structure consisted of 10610 million in total indebtedness and 19109 million in shareholders’ equity the ratio of debttototal capital at december 31 2007 was 357 compared with 308 at december 31 2006 our targeted debttototal capital ratio is 40 or less 

 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders in order to meet these cash requirements we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

 

we paid dividends in 2007 of 599 million compared with 566 million in 2006 and 531 million in 2005 we anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a quarterly basis 

 

during 2006 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 100 million as of december 31 2006 we had purchased 1986026 shares for 594 million pursuant to this authorization during 2006 in december 2006 the board of directors authorized the continuation of the repurchase program in 2007 with a maximum dollar limit of 406 million this authorization expired on december 31 2007 as of december 31 2007 we repurchased an additional 

1209257 shares for 406 million pursuant to this plan in december 2007 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 50 million starting in 2008 the authorization expires on december 31 2008 

 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

 

 

 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2007 variable interest rate debt including the effects of derivative financial instruments was 2024 million at a weighted average interest rate of 527 

 

we expect to make contributions in the range of 20 million to 25 million to our pension plans in 2008 the 2008 expected contributions will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements 

 

as of december 31 2007 the gross liability for uncertain tax positions under fin 48 is 239 million we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months we are not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the noncurrent fin 48 obligations 

 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 conversion of net income free cash flow and conversion of net income are nongaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt in addition free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities 

 

 

in 2008 our objective is to generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 of net income 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2007 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

 

commitments and contingencies 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties “prp” in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 which relate to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2007 and 2006 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 35 million and 56 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

standby letters of credit 

in the ordinary course of business we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs and certain legal matters as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 585 million and 596 million respectively 

 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our 

observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

 

impairment of goodwill 

the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates if these estimates change we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2007 we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets 

 

pension 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense 

 

in december 2006 we adopted sfas no 158 employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in our 2006 yearend balance sheet with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 

 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a discount rate for our us plans of 650 in 2007 600 in 2006 and 575 in 2005 the discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 200 to 525 in 2007 200 to 515 in 2006 and 200 to 490 in 2005 there are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2008 

 

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2007 equaled 85 which remained unchanged from 2006 and 2005 the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable 

yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices in 2007 the pension plan assets yielded a return of 78 compared to returns of 123 in 2006 and 42 in 2005 in 2007 our expected return on plan assets was higher than our actual return on plan assets in 2006 our expected return on plan assets was lower than our actual return on plan assets and in 2005 our expected return on plan assets was higher than our actual return on plans assets the significant difference between our expected return on plan assets compared to our actual return on plan assets in 2005 was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of our common stock during 2005 which approximates 10 of the plan assets there are no known or anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2008 

 

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyearperiod the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion shortterm borrowing and interest rate swaps the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 10765 million and 7536 million respectively 

 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio including swap agreements as of december 31 2007 was primarily comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars 97 this debt portfolio is comprised of 62 fixedrate debt and 38 variablerate debt not considering the effects of our interest rate swaps taking into account the variable to fixed rate swap agreement we entered with an effective date of april 2006 and august 2007 our debt portfolio is comprised of 81 fixedrate debt and 19 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2007 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 20 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates because some sales transactions and the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro

seasonality 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sales “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

 

competition 

our water group faces numerous domestic and international competitors some of which have substantially greater resources consolidation globalization and outsourcing are continuing trends in the water industry competition in commercial and residential pump markets focuses on brand names product performance quality and price while home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps they are much less important for commercial pumps for municipal pumps competition 

  focuses on performance to meet required specifications service and price competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses on product performance and design quality delivery and price for pool and spa equipment competition focuses on brand names product performance quality and price we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing industry penetration

recent developments 

growth of our business 

we continually look at each of our businesses to determine whether they fit with our strategic vision our primary focus is on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities especially in international markets we seek growth through product and service innovation market expansion and acquisitions acquisitions have played an important part in the growth of our business and we expect acquisitions will continue to be an important part of our future growth

information regarding all business segments 

 

backlog 

our backlog of orders as of december 31 by segment was 

 

 

 

the 725 million increase in water group backlog was primarily due to better than anticipated fourth quarter 2006 early buy orders in our pool business that are scheduled to ship in the first quarter of 2007 growth in asian markets and increased backlog for pumps used in municipal market applications the 64 million decrease in technical products group backlog reflected a decline in orders from the telecommunications market and data communications projects which have reached endoflife due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry practice for the majority of our businesses backlog which typically represents approximately 30 days of shipments is not deemed to be a significant item a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month we expect that most of our backlog at december 31 2006 will be filled in 2007 

 

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in our own facilities which consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2006 2005 and 2004 were 581 million 460 million and 315 million respectively 

 

environmental 

environmental matters are discussed in item 3 item 7 and in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

 

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the manufacturing of our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

 

the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages todate due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

 

certain commodities such as metals and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with escalatordeescalator clauses prices for raw materials such as metals and resins may continue to trend higher in the future 

   

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trade mark trade name or brand name 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the termination of patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 14800 people worldwide total employees in the united states were approximately 9100 of whom approximately 900 are represented by six different trade unions having collective bargaining agreements generally labor relations have been satisfactory 

 

captive insurance subsidiary 

we insure certain general and product liability property workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary penwald insurance company “penwald” reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses prepenwald liabilities and those of certain foreign operations are established without regard to the availability of insurance

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision if any of the risks described below actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in that case the price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to other information set forth in this document 

 

demand for our products will be affected by general economic conditions 

 

we compete globally in varied markets among these the most significant are north american industrial and commercial markets for both the water and technical products groups and the north american residential market for the water group economic conditions in the united states affect the robustness of our north american markets important factors include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy industrial and municipal capital spending the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets the age of existing housing stock unemployment rates availability of consumer financing and interest rates new construction for residential housing and home improvement activity fell dramatically in 2006 which reduced revenue growth in our water group especially in the pool and spa and pump markets we address we cannot give any assurance that we will not continue to encounter 

  weakness in these markets further while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions we cannot assure you that a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region would not have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our businesses operate in highly competitive markets so we may be forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs 

 

our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of their respective markets competition may force us to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive we compete on the basis of product design quality availability performance customer service and price present or future competitors may have greater financial technical or other resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected business or businesses we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 

 

our inability to sustain consistent organic growth could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

in 2006 and 2005 our organic growth was generated in part from expanding international sales entering new distribution channels and introducing new products to grow more rapidly than our end markets we will have to continue to expand our geographic reach further diversify our distribution channels continue to introduce new products and increase sales of existing products to our customer base we may not be able to successfully meet those challenges which could adversely affect our ability to sustain consistent organic growth if we are unable to sustain consistent organic growth we will be less likely to meet our stated revenue growth targets which together with any resulting impact on our net income growth would likely adversely affect the market price of our stock 

 

our inability to complete or successfully complete and integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

a significant percentage of our net sales growth in 2006 and 2005 was generated as a result of acquisitions completed in 2004 or subsequent periods including our acquisition of wicor and the thermal businesses we may not be able to sustain this level of growth from acquisition activity in the future we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions primarily in our current business segments and we may consider acquisitions outside of these segments as well our ability to expand through acquisitions is subject to various risks including the following 

 

  

acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisitions while we attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our operations once integrated acquired operations may not achieve the levels of profitability originally anticipated 

 

material cost and other inflation could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we are experiencing material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses we are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in base materials such as metals and other costs such as pension health care and insurance we also 

  are continuing to implement our excellence in operations initiatives in order to continuously reduce our costs we cannot assure you however that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity may negatively impact our results of operations 

 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sales “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts we cannot assure you that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

intellectual property challenges may hinder product development and marketing 

 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products 

 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

 

our business exposes us to potential litigation especially product liability suits that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products such as the horizon litigation discussed in item 3 of this annual report on form 10k while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our product reputation financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

the availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on our continued growth 

 

our plans to continue growth in our chosen markets will require additional capital for future acquisitions capital expenditures for existing businesses growth of working capital and continued international and regional expansion in the past we have financed our growth primarily through debt financing any significant future acquisitions will require us to expand our debt financing resources or to issue equity securities our financial results may be adversely affected if interest costs under our debt financings are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other internal growth in addition future acquisitions could be dilutive to your equity investment if we issue additional stock to fund acquisitions there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue equity securities or to obtain future debt financing at favorable terms without sufficient financing we will not be able to pursue our growth strategy which will limit our growth and revenues in the future 

 

our international operations are subject to foreign market and currency fluctuation risks 

 

we expect the percentage of our sales outside of north america to increase in the future over the past few years the economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do business have had slower growth than the us economy the european union currently accounts for the majority of our foreign sales and income in which our most significant european market is germany in addition we have a significant and growing business in the asiapacific area we cannot predict how changing market conditions in these regions will impact our financial results 

   

we are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results as of december 31 2006 we held immaterial positions in foreign exchangeforward contracts 

 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

 

sales outside of north america including export sales from north american businesses accounted for approximately 23 of our net sales in 2006 further most of our businesses obtain some raw materials and finished goods from foreign suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 

  

our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

 

we are exposed to potential environmental liabilities and litigation 

 

compliance with environmental regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require 

 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties “prp” in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses 

 

we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

   

provisions of our restated articles of incorporation bylaws and minnesota law could deter takeover attempts 

 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents under minnesota law and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor 

 

our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions relating to the election appointment and removal of directors as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting requirements which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control in addition our common share purchase rights could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us which could deter some acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers also the minnesota business corporations act contains control share acquisition and business combination provisions which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control our shareholders might view any such transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

 

we comply with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 accounting for contingencies  and related guidance and record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be reasonably estimated factors that are considered when determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met include the a nature of the litigation claim or assessment b progress of the case including progress after the date of the financial statements but before the issuance date of the financial statements c opinions of legal counsel and d management’s intended response to the litigation claim or assessment where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range we record the most likely estimate of the loss when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount however the minimum amount in the range is accrued gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 

 

while we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential 

  impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “legal proceedings” could change in the future 

 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties “prp” in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 which relate to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2006 and 2005 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 56 million and 64 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

 

horizon litigation 

twentyeight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs a class action and claims for indemnity by celebrity cruise lines inc “celebrity” were brought against essef corporation “essef” and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of essef in august 1999 the claims against essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the allegation that essef designed manufactured and marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the spa system on the horizon cruise ship and allegations that the spa and filters contained legionnaire’s disease bacteria that infected certain passengers on cruises from april 1994 through july 1994 

 

the individual and class claims by passengers were tried and resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the part of the essef defendants 70 and celebrity and its sister company fantasia together 30 after expiration of posttrial appeals we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of 70 million in the horizon cases plus interest of approximately 16 million in january 2004 all of the personal injury cases have now been resolved through either settlement or judgment 

   

the only remaining unresolved claims in this case were those brought by celebrity for damages resulting from the outbreak celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and costs for prior litigation as well as outofpocket losses lost profits and loss of business enterprise value on june 28 2006 a jury returned a verdict against the essef defendants in the total amount of 1930 million for its claims for outofpocket expenses 104 million lost profits 476 million and lost enterprise value 1350 million the verdict was exclusive of prejudgment interest and attorneys’ fees 

 

on january 17 2007 the court ruled on our posttrial motions granting judgment in our favor as a matter of law with respect to celebrity’s claim for lost enterprise value 1350 million the court also granted a new trial with respect to lost profits 476 million in addition the court denied without prejudice our claim for contribution to reduce celebrity’s recovery by 30 to account for its contributory negligence with leave to renew the motion following retrial 

 

celebrity’s claim for lost profits at trial amounted to approximately 603 million we believe that actual lost profits suffered if any are substantially less in a new trial there remain questions of causation contribution and proof of damages to be determined we intend to vigorously defend against celebrity’s claims we cannot predict whether celebrity will appeal the ruling on lost enterprise value nor whether and to what extent essef may eventually be found liable on celebrity’s claims 

 

several issues have not been decided by the court including whether celebrity is entitled to recovery of its attorneys’ fees and related costs in the passenger claims phase of the case 41 million and with respect to prejudgment interest the length of the interest period and the rate of interest on any eventual judgment we have assessed the impact of the ruling on our previously established reserves for this matter and based on information available at this time have not changed our reserves following this ruling except to take into account quarterly interest accruals 

 

we believe that any judgment we pay in this matter would be taxdeductible in the year paid or in subsequent years in addition to the impact of any loss on this matter on our earnings per share when recognized we may need to borrow funds from our banks or other sources to pay any judgment finally determined after exhaustion of all appeals we expect that we would have available adequate funds to allow us to do so based on discussions with our lending sources and our estimates of the results of our business operations over the foreseeable future

the following graph sets forth the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock for the last five years assuming the investment of 100 on december 31 2001 and the reinvestment of all dividends since that date to december 31 2006 the graph also contains for comparison purposes the sp 500 index and the sp midcap 400 index assuming the same investment level and reinvestment of dividends 

 

by virtue of its market capitalization pentair is a component of the sp midcap 400 index on the basis of our size and diversity of businesses we have not found a readily identifiable peer group we believe the sp midcap 400 index is an appropriate comparison we have evaluated other published indices but have determined that the results are skewed by significantly larger companies included in the indices we believe such a comparison would not be meaningful

overview 

we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water our technical products group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal management markets designing and manufacturing standard modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components thermal management products and accessories in 2007 we expect our water group and technical products group to generate approximately 70 and 30 of total revenues respectively 

 

our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately 125 million in 1995 to approximately 22 billion in 2006 we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target market totaling 60 billion our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement storage treatment and enjoyment of water 

 

our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as defense security medical and networking we believe we have the largest enclosures industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and the highest enclosures brand recognition in the industry in north america from mid2001 through 2003 the technical products group experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and overcapacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets from 2004 through 2006 sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors new products and higher demand in targeted markets in addition through the success of our pentair integrated management system “pims” initiatives we have increased technical products’ segment operating margins to our goal of 15 and achieved 17 consecutive quarters of yearoveryear operating margin expansion

liquidity and capital resources 

cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments and dividend payments are generally funded from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings in 2006 we invested 29 million in acquisitions repurchased 59 million of our stock paid 57 million in dividends and decreased our debt by 9 million 

 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from april 

  to august the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sales “early buy” programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly by heavy flooding and droughts 

 

the following table presents selected working capital measurements calculated from our monthly operating results based on a 13month moving average 

 

 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2316 million in 2006 or 162 million lower compared with the same period in 2005 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to working capital increases related to increased inventory levels and decreases in various accruals the increase in days inventory on hand as of december 31 2006 compared to december 31 2005 was attributable to increased inventory levels to support product moves and plant rationalizations inventory to support product sourced from low cost countries higher value of inventories due to rising raw material input costs and due to the purchase of additional submersible pump motors for competitive reasons in the future we expect our working capital ratios to improve as we complete our facility rationalization activities and capitalize on our pims initiatives 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 2479 million in 2005 or 162 million lower compared with the same period in 2004 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to working capital increases related to increased sales volume the rationalization of water group operations and increases in various customer rebates the increased days of sales in accounts receivable as of december 31 2005 compared to december 31 2004 was the result of the differences in sales terms offered by the former wicor business compared to the terms offered by our former tools group and the sale of approximately a 220 million interest in a pool of accounts receivable to a thirdparty financial institution in 2004 the increased days inventory on hand as of december 31 2005 compared to december 31 2004 was driven by the increased inventory levels attributable to increased sourcing out of asia higher value of inventories due to rising raw material input costs and inventory redundancies associated with the rampup of new facilities and the winddown of old facilities 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 2641 million in 2004 or 12 million higher compared with the same period in 2003 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income offset by higher levels of inventory due to inventory builds to support customers during product transfers and plant consolidation activities in water the wicor acquisition also increased our working capital ratios primarily inventory days 

 

in december 2006 and 2004 we sold approximately 300 million and 220 million respectively of accounts receivable to a thirdparty financial institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk because we did not offer or the customer did not take advantage of the early pay discounts and to provide additional financing capacity in compliance with sfas no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows in 2006 a loss in the amount of 08 million related to the sale of accounts receivable is included in the line item gain on sale of assets net in our consolidated statements of income in 2004 no gain or loss was recorded as the estimated present value of the receivables sold approximated the carrying amount 

   

investing activities 

capital expenditures in 2006 2005 and 2004 were 511 million 625 million and 489 million including 431 million for continuing operations respectively we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2007 to be approximately 70 to 80 million primarily for capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing facilities implementation of a unified business systems infrastructure in europe new product development and general maintenance capital 

 

on april 12 2006 we acquired as part of our water group the assets of geyer’s manufacturing  design inc and fta filtration inc together “krystil klear” two privately held companies for 155 million in cash krystil klear expands our industrial filtration product offering to include a full range of steel and stainless steel tanks which house filtration solutions 

 

during 2006 we completed several other small acquisitions totaling 142 million in cash and notes payable adding to both our water and technical products groups 

 

in january 2006 pursuant to the purchase agreement for the sale of our former tools group we completed the repurchase of a manufacturing facility in suzhou china from bdk for approximately 57 million we recorded no gain or loss on the repurchase in march 2006 we completed an outstanding net asset value arbitration with bdk relating to the purchase price for the sale of our former tools group the decision by the arbitrator constituted a final resolution of all disputes between bdk and us regarding the net asset value we paid the final net asset value purchase price adjustment pursuant to the purchase agreement of 161 million plus interest of 11 million in march 2006 resulting in an incremental pretax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of 34 million or 16 million net of tax in the third quarter of 2006 we resolved a prior year tax item that resulted in a 14 million income tax benefit related to our former tools group also in march 2006 we exited a leased facility from our former service equipment business resulting in a net cash outflow of 22 million and an immaterial gain from disposition 

 

during 2006 we made investments in and loans to certain joint ventures in the amount of 75 million 

 

cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 171 million in 2005 was primarily related to the sale of three facilities for our water group 

 

on december 1 2005 we acquired as part of our technical products group the thermal businesses from apw for approximately 1439 million including a cash payment of 1406 million and transaction costs of 33 million these businesses provide thermal management solutions and integration services to the telecommunications data communications medical and security markets

in the third quarter 2005 we paid 104 million in postclosing purchase price adjustments related to the october 2004 sale of our former tools group to bdk 

 

in april 2005 we sold our interest in the stock of ln holdings corporation for cash consideration of 236 million resulting in a pretax gain of 52 million and an after tax gain of 33 million the terms of the sale agreement established two escrow accounts totaling 14 million to be used for payment of any potential adjustments to the purchase price transaction expenses and indemnification for certain losses such as environmental claims in december 2005 we received 02 million from the escrow accounts which increased our gain from the sale during 2006 we received 12 million from the escrow accounts which also increased our gain from the sale any remaining escrow balances are to be distributed by april 2008 to the former shareholders in accordance with their ownership percentages any funds received from settlement of escrows in future periods will be accounted for as additional gain on the sale of this interest 

 

effective july 31 2004 we completed the acquisition of all of the shares of capital stock of wicor from wisconsin energy corporation for 8747 million including a cash payment of 8711 million transaction costs of 112 million and debt assumed of 216 million less a favorable final purchase price adjustment of 

  140 million and less cash acquired of 152 million this includes an additional 04 million in transaction costs recorded in the first three quarters of 2005 

 

on april 5 2004 we acquired all of the remaining stock of the tools group’s asian joint venture for 218 million in cash 64 million of which was paid following the sale of the tools group the level of return on sales targets achieved in the second quarter of 2004 required a payment of 09 million which was recorded as an increase to goodwill the acquisition included cash acquired of 62 million and debt assumed of 90 million the investment in the tools group’s asian joint venture business was sold as part of the tools group to bdk 

 

during 2004 we paid 39 million in purchase price adjustments related to the december 31 2003 acquisition of everpure the adjustment primarily related to the final determination of closing date net assets we also paid 23 million for acquisition fees which were primarily related to the everpure acquisition 

 

effective after the close of business october 2 2004 we completed the sale of our tools group to bdk for approximately 7968 million in cash including a 218 million interim net asset value increase subject to postclosing adjustments 

 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 1178 million 438 million and 1378 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively financing activities consisted primarily of draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business dividend payments share repurchases and cash received from stock option exercises 

 

we have a multicurrency revolving credit facility the “credit facility” of 800 million expiring on march 4 2010 we are authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility we use the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2006 we had 2089 million of commercial paper outstanding that matures within 49 days all of the commercial paper was classified as longterm as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility 

 

in march 2005 we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit facility increasing the size of the facility from 500 million to 800 million with a term of five years the interest rate on the loans under the 800 million credit facility is libor plus 0625 interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings 

 

effective following the close of business on july 31 2004 we completed the acquisition of wicor we funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with an 850 million committed line of credit “the bridge facility” and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility the interest rate on the bridge facility and loans under the credit facility during the period of the bridge facility was libor plus 1375 

 

on october 4 2004 we received approximately 7968 million of proceeds from the sale of our tools group to bdk as required under the terms of the bridge facility we used the proceeds from the tools group sale and additional borrowings under the credit facility to pay off the bridge facility following payment of the bridge facility and based on our existing credit ratings the interest rate on loans under the credit facility decreased to libor plus 1125 

 

we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december 31 2006 

 

in addition to the credit facility we have 25 million of uncommitted credit facilities under which we had drawn 140 million in borrowings as of december 31 2006 

 

our current credit ratings are as follows 

 

 

  we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 

 

we issue shortterm commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard  poor’s or moody’s even though our shortterm commercial paper is unrated we believe a downgrade in our longterm debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 

 

we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our longterm debt by either standard  poor’s or moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets however depending upon market conditions the amount timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected if both of our longterm debt ratings were downgraded to below bbbbaa3 our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced in the event of a downgrade of our longterm debt rating the cost of borrowing and fees payable under our credit facility and 35 million private placement fixed rate note could increase while the credit facility has a pricing grid based in part on credit ratings we do not have any agreements under which the obligations are accelerated in the event of a ratings downgrade 

 

as of december 31 2006 our capital structure consisted of 7441 million in total indebtedness and 16700 million in shareholders’ equity the ratio of debttototal capital at december 31 2006 was 308  compared with 326 at december 31 2005 our targeted debttototal capital ratio is 40 or less 

 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders in order to meet these cash requirements we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

 

we paid dividends in 2006 of 566 million compared with 531 million in 2005 and 431 million in 2004 we anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a quarterly basis 

 

in december 2005 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 25 million of our common stock on july 28 2006 the board of directors increased our repurchase authorization to 50 million and on september 28 2006 the board of directors further increased our repurchase authorization to 100 million as of december 31 2006 we had purchased 1986026 shares for 594 million pursuant to these programs during 2006 the board of directors authorized the continuation of the repurchase program in 2007 with a maximum dollar limit of 406 million this authorization expires on december 31 2007 as of february 16 2007 we had not repurchased any additional shares under this plan and accordingly we have the authority in 2007 to repurchase shares up to a maximum dollar limit of 406 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively we repurchased 755663 shares and 105500 shares of our common stock under similar authorizations 

   

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

 

 

 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2006 variable interest rate debt including the effects of derivative financial instruments was 2479 million at a weighted average interest rate of 57 

 

we expect to make contributions in the range of 15 million to 20 million to our pension plans in 2007 the 2007 expected contributions will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements 

 

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income we have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 conversion of net income free cash flow and conversion of net income are nongaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt in addition free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities 

 

 

 

in 2007 our objective is to generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 of net income 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2006 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

   

commitments and contingencies 

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties “prp” in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in prior years to date our recorded accruals have been adequate 

 

in addition there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 which relate to operations no longer carried out at the sites we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2006 and 2005 our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 56 million and 64 million respectively we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

standby letters of credit 

in the ordinary course of business predominantly for contracts and bids involving municipal pump products we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs and certain legal matters as of december 31 2006 and 2005 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 596 million and 388 million respectively 

 

new accounting standards 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

 

critical accounting policies 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

 37 

   

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

 

impairment of goodwill 

the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates if these estimates change we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets 

 

pension 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 11 to the notes to consolidated financial statements changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense 

 

in december 2006 we adopted sfas no 158 employer’s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans — an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r “sfas 158” sfas 158 requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in our 2006 yearend balance sheet with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 

 

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a discount rate for our us plans of 600 in 2006 and 575 in 2005 and 2004 the discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 200 to 515 in 2006 200 to 490 in 2005 and 200 to 525 in 2004 there are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2007 

 

expected rate of return 

our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2006 equaled 85 which remained unchanged from 2005 and 2004 the expected rate of return is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical returns with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices in 2006 the pension plan assets yielded a return of 123 compared to returns of 42 in 2005 and 176 in 2004 in 2006 our expected return on plan assets was lower than our actual return on plan assets while in 2005 our expected return on plan assets was higher than our actual return on plans assets the significant difference between our expected return on plan assets compared to our actual return on plan assets in 2005 was primarily attributable to the fluctuations 

  of our common stock during 2005 which approximates 10 of the plan assets there are no known or anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2007 

 

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyearperiod the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion shortterm borrowing interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 7536 million and 7690 million respectively 

 

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio including swap agreements as of december 31 2006 was primarily comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars 97 this debt portfolio is comprised of 53 fixedrate debt and 47 variablerate debt not considering the effects of our interest rate swaps taking into account the variable to fixed rate swap agreement we entered with an effective date of april 2006 our debt portfolio is comprised of 67 fixedrate debt and 33 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2006 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 25 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

 

foreign currency risk 

we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates because some sales transactions and the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro we held immaterial positions in foreign exchangeforward contracts as of december 31 2006 we do not expect the effect of foreign exchange rates to have a material impact on our operations

seasonality

competition 

 

our water group faces numerous domestic and international competitors some of which have substantially greater resources consolidation globalization and outsourcing are continuing trends in the water industry competition in commercial and residential pump markets focuses on brand names product performance quality and price while home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps they are much less important for commercial pumps for municipal pumps competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications service and price competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses on product performance and design quality delivery and price for pool and spa equipment there are a significant number of competitors we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing industry penetration

recent developments 

 

growth of our business 

 

we continually look at each of our businesses to determine whether they fit with our evolving strategic vision our primary focus is on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities especially in international markets we seek growth through product and service innovation market expansion and acquisitions acquisitions have played an important part in the growth of our business and we expect acquisitions will continue to be an important part of our growth in the future

discontinued operationsdivestitures 

 

effective after the close of business october 2 2004 we completed the sale of our former tools group to the black  decker corporation “bdk” for approximately 7968 million in cash including a 218 million interim net asset value increase subject to postclosing adjustments the tools group was comprised of the portercable ®  delta ®  devilbiss air power oldham saw and flex ® brands among others we used the proceeds from the tools group sale and borrowings under our credit facility to repay on october 4 2004 an 

850 million bridge facility used to acquire wicor in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a loss on the disposal of the tools group of 60 million net of a tax provision of 90 million in july 2005 we paid 104 million to bdk in purchase price adjustments related to the sale of our former tools group we currently have an outstanding dispute with bdk over the net asset value of the tools group and may be required to repay additional proceeds we believe our accrual at december 31 2005 is an adequate reserve amount for any potential liability we expect resolution of this matter in the first quarter of 2006

information regarding all business segments 

 

backlog 

 

our backlog of orders from continuing operations as of december 31 by segment was 

 

 

 

the 69 million decrease in water group backlog was primarily due to the timing of filtration and pool product orders the 314 million increase in technical products group backlog reflects the acquisition of the thermal management businesses from apw as well as order growth in the group’s asian businesses particularly china due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry practice backlog which typically represents approximately 30 days of shipments is not deemed to be a significant item for our business a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month we expect that most of our backlog at december 31 2005 will be filled in 2006 

 

research and development 

 

we conduct research and development activities in our own facilities which consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2005 2004 and 2003 were 460 million 315 million and 229 million respectively 

 

environmental 

 

environmental matters are discussed in item 3 item 7 and in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

 

raw materials 

 

the principal materials used in the manufacturing of our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels 

6 the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages todate due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

 

certain commodities such as steel and resin are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with escalatordeescalator clauses prices for raw materials such as steel carbon and resins may continue to trend higher in the future 

 

intellectual property 

 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trade mark trade name or brand name 

 

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the termination of patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2005 pentair inc and its subsidiaries employed an aggregate of approximately 14700 people worldwide total employees in the united states were approximately 10700 of whom approximately 900 are represented by six different trade unions having collective bargaining agreements generally labor relations have been satisfactory

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

you should carefully consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision if any of the risks described below actually occur our business financial condition results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected in that case the price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment you should also refer to the other information set forth in this document 

 

demand for our products will be affected by general economic conditions 

 

demand for our residential and commercial products is influenced by many economic conditions including but not limited to new construction activity and the level of repair and remodeling activity the level of new construction and repair and remodeling activity is affected by a number of factors beyond our control such as the overall strength of the economy including confidence in the economy by our customers the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets institutional building activity the age of existing housing stock unemployment rates availability of consumer financing and interest rates any declines in new housing or commercial construction starts or demand for replacement building and home improvement products may adversely impact us and there can be no assurance that any such adverse effects would not be material and would not continue for an indeterminate period of time further while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions we cannot assure you that a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region would not have a material adverse effect on us 

 

our businesses operate in highly competitive markets so we may be forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs 

 

our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of their respective markets competition may force us to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive we compete on the basis of product design quality availability performance customer service and price present or future competitors may have greater financial technical or other resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected business or businesses we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our inability to sustain consistent organic growth could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

in 2005 our organic growth was generated in part from expanding international sales entering new distribution channels and introducing new products to grow more rapidly than our end markets we will have to continue to expand our geographic reach further diversify our distribution channels continue to introduce new products and increase sales of existing products to our customer base we may not be able to successfully meet those challenges which could adversely affect our ability to sustain consistent organic growth if we are unable to sustain consistent organic growth we will be less likely to meet our stated revenue growth targets which could adversely affect our net income growth and in turn the market price of our stock 

 

our inability to complete or successfully complete and integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our financial performance 

 

a significant percentage of our net sales growth in 2005 and 2004 was generated as a result of acquisitions completed during those periods including our acquisition of wicor and everpure we may not be able to sustain this level of growth from acquisition activity in the future we intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions primarily in our current business segments and we may consider acquisitions outside of these segments as well our ability to expand through acquisitions is subject to various risks including the following 

 

 8 

 

  

acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisitions while we attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our operations once integrated acquired operations may not achieve the levels of profitability originally anticipated 

 

material cost inflation could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we are experiencing material cost inflation in a number of our businesses we are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in base materials such as steel resins ocean freight and fuel health care and insurance we also are continuing to implement our excellence in operations initiatives in order to continuously reduce our costs we cannot assure you however that these actions will be successful to manage our costs or increase our productivity continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve productivity may negatively impact our results of operations 

 

seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial results 

 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water group enduser demand for poolspa equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from march to july the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by effective use of the distribution channel by employing advance sales programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by water patterns particularly related to heavy flooding and droughts we cannot assure you that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

intellectual property challenges may hinder product development and marketing 

 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business intellectual property protection however may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products over the past few years we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to compete patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop engineer and market our products 

 

our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation 

 

our business exposes us to potential litigation especially product liability suits that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of our products while we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities in addition we selfinsure a portion of product liability claims a series of successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our product reputation and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

we may be required to make payments in respect of businesses that we have sold 

 

we have sold a number of businesses over the last ten years including the sale of our former tools group to bdk in october 2004 in this and other dispositions we typically agree to indemnify the buyers with respect to certain matters relating to the businesses that we have sold and we may from time to time be required to make payments to the buyers under those indemnities to the extent we are required to make any 

such payments in the future those payments could be substantial which could require us to borrow additional amounts at unfavorable borrowing terms and cause a significant decrease in our liquidity both of which could severely harm our business 

 

the availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on our continued growth 

 

our plans to continue our growth in our chosen markets will require additional capital for future acquisitions capital expenditures for existing businesses growth of working capital and continued international and regional expansion in the past we have financed our growth primarily through debt financings any significant future acquisitions will require us to expand our debt financing resources or to issue equity securities our financial results may be adversely affected if interest costs under our debt financings are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other internal growth in addition future acquisitions could be dilutive to your equity investment if we issue additional stock to fund acquisitions we cannot be assured that we will be able to issue equity securities or to obtain future debt financing at favorable terms without sufficient financing we will not be able to pursue our growth strategy which will limit our growth and revenues in the future 

 

our international operations are subject to foreign market and currency fluctuation risks 

 

we expect the percentage of sales outside of north america to increase in the future over the past few years the economies of many of the foreign countries in which we do business have had slower growth than the us economy the european union currently accounts for the majority of our foreign sales and income our most significant european market is germany where the capital goods market has been very slow we cannot predict how changing european market conditions will impact our financial results 

 

we are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results as of december 31 2005 we held immaterial positions in foreign exchangeforward contracts 

 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

 

sales outside of north america including export sales from north american businesses accounted for approximately 22 of our net sales in 2005 further certain of our businesses obtain raw materials and finished goods from foreign suppliers accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 

  

our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

we are exposed to potential environmental liabilities and litigation 

 

compliance with environmental regulations could require us to discharge environmental liabilities increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we are subject to federal state local and foreign laws and regulations governing public and worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer we are also required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain permits some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may require 

 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties prps in a number of environmental cleanups relating to our current or former business units we have disposed of a number of businesses over the last ten years and in certain cases we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for existing business units as well as both divested and acquired businesses 

 

we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

provisions of our restated articles of incorporation bylaws and minnesota law could deter takeover attempts 

 

antitakeover provisions in our charter documents under minnesota law and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor 

 

our restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions relating to the election appointment and removal of directors as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting requirements which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control in addition our common share purchase rights could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us which could deter some acquirers from making takeover proposals or tender offers also the minnesota business corporations act contains control share acquisition and business combination provisions which could delay prevent or make more difficult a merger tender offer proxy contest or other change of control our shareholders might view any such a transaction as being in their best interests since the transaction could result in a higher stock price than the current market price for our common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend  

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

 

we comply with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 accounting for contingencies  and related guidance and record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be reasonably estimated factors that are considered when determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met include the a nature of the litigation claim or assessment b progress of the case including progress after the date of the financial statements but before the issuance date of the financial statements c opinions of legal counsel and d management’s intended response to the litigation claim or assessment where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range we record the most likely estimate of the loss when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount however the minimum amount in the range is accrued gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 

 

while we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “legal proceedings” could change in the future 

 

environmental 

 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses over the last ten years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in 2005 and 2003 and our recorded accrual was adequate 

 

in addition there are pending environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 which relates to operations no longer carried out at that site we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when it is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2005 and 2004 our reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 64 million and 94 million respectively measured on an undiscounted basis we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

product liability claims 

 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

 

horizon litigation 

 

twentyeight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs a class action and claims for indemnity by celebrity cruise lines inc celebrity were brought against essef corporation essef and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of essef in august 1999 celebrity has alleged that it had sustained economic damages due to loss of use of the mv horizon while it was drydocked 

 

the claims against essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the allegation that essef designed manufactured and marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the spa system on the horizon and allegations that the spa and filters contained legionnaire’s disease bacteria that infected certain passengers on cruises from december 1993 through july 1994 

 

the individual and class claims by passengers were tried and resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the part of the essef defendants 70 and celebrity and its sister company fantasia together 30 

 

after expiration of posttrial appeals we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of 70 million in the horizon cases plus interest of approximately 16 million in january 2004 we had reserved for the amount of punitive damages awarded at the time of the essef acquisition a reserve for the 16 million interest cost was recorded in 2003 all of the personal injury cases have now been resolved through either settlement or trial 

 

the only remaining unresolved claims in this case are those brought by celebrity for damages resulting from the outbreak celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and costs for prior litigation as well as outofpocket losses lost profits and loss of business enterprise value discovery commenced late in 2004 and was completed in august 2005 celebrity’s claims for damages exceed 185 million assuming matters of causation standing contribution and proof are decided against it essef’s experts believe that damages should amount to no more than approximately 16 to 25 million dispositive motions in this matter were filed in august 2005 which were decided in december 2005 celebrity’s motion for indemnity from essef for payments made by celebrity for passenger claims of approximately 23 million was denied essef’s motion for dismissal of certain damage claims was denied without prejudice to renewal in conjunction with both parties’ motions to exclude certain expert testimony we expect these motions to be adjudicated in march 2006 trial has been scheduled for april 24 2006 we believe our reserves for any liability to celebrity are adequate and intend to vigorously defend against these claims

overview 

 

we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and technical products our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement treatment storage and enjoyment of water our technical products group is a global leader in the global enclosures market that designs manufactures and markets standard modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive controls components thermal management products and accessories in 2006 our water group and technical products group are forecasted to generate approximately 70 percent and 30 percent of total revenues respectively 

 

our water group has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from 100 million in 1995 to approximately 21 billion in 2005 we believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large global market size of which we have identified a target industry segment totaling 50 billion our vision is to become a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement treatment storage and enjoyment of water 

 

as of july 31 2004 we continued the expansion of our global footprint in the water equipment industry through the acquisition of wicor a manufacturer of pumps filtration and pool equipment marketed primarily under the starite ®  shurflo ®  and hypro ® brands we initially funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with an 850 million committed line of credit the “bridge facility” and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility we used the proceeds from the tools group sale to repay on october 4 2004 the 850 million bridge facility 

 

we realized 36 million in synergies net of integration costs in the first full year of ownership with respect to the wicor acquisition via key initiatives including facility rationalizations lean enterprise material cost savings and administrative cost savings we also expect to achieve significant working capital reductions net fixed asset reductions and revenue synergies from crossselling opportunities during the first two years of ownership as a result of the acquisition integration of the former wicor businesses proceeded as expected during 2005 with 17 facilities closed or consolidated to date 

 

our technical products group operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as defense security medical and networking we believe we have the largest enclosures industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and highest enclosures brand recognition in the industry from mid2001 through mid2003 the technical products group experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and overcapacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets in 2004 and 2005 sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors new products and higher demand in all targeted markets in addition through the success of our pims initiatives we have increased technical products segment margins for sixteen consecutive quarters

we expect our full year effective tax rate in 2006 to be 36 percent we will continue to pursue tax rate reduction opportunities 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments and dividend payments are generally funded from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings in 2005 we invested 151 million in acquisitions paid 53 million in dividends and repurchased 25 million of our stock and increased our debt by only 17 million 

 

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water segment enduser demand for poolspa equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from march to july the magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by effective use of the distribution channel by employing some advance sales programs generally including extended payment terms andor additional discounts demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly related to heavy flooding and droughts 

the following table presents selected working capital measurements calculated from our monthly operating results based on a 13month moving average 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 2479 million in 2005 or 162 million lower compared with the same period in 2004 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is due to working capital increases related to increased sales volume the rationalization of water segment operations and increases in various customer rebates the increased days of sales in accounts receivable as of december 31 2005 compared to december 31 2004 is the result of the differences in sales terms offered by the former wicor business compared to the terms offered by our former tools group and the sale of approximately a 220 million interest in a pool of accounts receivable to a thirdparty financial institution in 2004 the increased days inventory on hand as of december 31 2005 compared to december 31 2004 was driven by the increased inventory levels attributable to increased sourcing out of asia higher value of inventories due to rising raw material input costs and inventory redundancies associated with the rampup of new facilities and the winddown of old facilities the working capital ratios as of december 31 2005 versus december 31 2004 have increased primarily for the same reasons in the future we expect our working capital ratios to improve as we are able to capitalize on the anticipated success of our postacquisition integration activities and pims initiatives 

 

cash provided by operating activities was 2641 million in 2004 or 12 million higher compared with the same period in 2003 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income offset by higher levels of inventory due to inventory builds to support customers during product transfers and plant consolidation activities in water the wicor acquisition has increased our working capital ratios primarily inventory days which will continue until our postacquisition integration activities are farther along and our pims initiatives are better established 

 

in december 2004 we sold an approximate 220 million interest in a pool of accounts receivable to a thirdparty financial institution to mitigate the credit risk associated with the receivable balance of a large customer in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows as the estimated present value of the receivables sold approximated the carrying amount no gain or loss was recorded in 2004 the accounts receivable purchase agreement was not renewed in 2005 

 

investing activities 

 

capital expenditures in 2005 2004 and 2003 were 625 million 489 million including 431 million for continuing operations and 436 million including 290 million for continuing operations respectively we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2006 to be approximately 80 to 85 million primarily for expansion of low cost country manufacturing facilities implementation of a unified business systems infrastructure in europe selective increases in equipment capacity new product development and general maintenance capital 

 

cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of 171 million in 2005 was primarily related to the sale of three facilities 

 

on december 1 2005 we acquired mclean thermal management aspen motion technologies and electronic solutions businesses from apw for approximately 1400 million including a cash payment of 

1389 million and transaction costs of 11 million these businesses provide thermal management solutions and integration services to the telecommunications data communications medical and security markets as part of our technical products group 

 

in the third quarter 2005 we paid 104 million in postclosing purchase price adjustments related to the october 2004 sale of our former tools group to the black  decker corporation 

 

in april 2005 we sold our interest in the stock of ln holdings corporation for cash consideration of 236 million resulting in a pretax gain of 52 million and an after tax gain of 33 million the terms of the sale agreement establish two escrow accounts totaling 14 million to be used for payment of any potential adjustments to the purchase price transaction expenses and indemnification for certain losses such as environmental claims in december 2005 we received 02m from the escrow accounts which increased our gain from the sale any remaining escrow balances are to be distributed by april 2008 to the former shareholders in accordance with their ownership percentages any funds received from settlement of escrows in future periods will be accounted for as additional gain on the sale of this interest 

 

on february 23 2005 we acquired certain assets of dep a privately held company for 103 million including a cash payment of 100 million transaction costs of 02 million plus debt assumed of 01 million the dep product line addresses the water and wastewater markets and is part of our water group 

 

effective after the close of business october 2 2004 we completed the sale of our tools group to bdk for approximately 7968 million in cash including a 218 million interim net asset value increase subject to postclosing adjustments 

 

effective july 31 2004 we completed the acquisition of all of the shares of capital stock of wicor from wisconsin energy corporation for 8747 million including a cash payment of 8711 million transaction costs of 112 million and debt assumed of 216 million less a favorable final purchase price adjustment of 140 million and less cash acquired of 152 million this includes an additional 04 million in transaction costs recorded in the first three quarters of 2005 

 

on april 5 2004 we acquired all of the remaining stock of the tools group’s asian joint venture for 218 million in cash 64 million of which was paid following the sale of the tools group the level of return on sales targets achieved in the second quarter of 2004 required a payment of 09 million which was recorded as an increase to goodwill the acquisition included cash acquired of 62 million and debt assumed of 90 million the investment in the tools group’s asian joint venture business was sold as part of the tools group to bdk 

 

in the second quarter of 2004 we paid 39 million in purchase price adjustments related to the december 31 2003 acquisition of everpure the adjustment primarily related to the final determination of closing date net assets 

 

in the first quarter of 2004 we paid 23 million for acquisition fees primarily related to the december 31 2003 acquisition of everpure 

 

financing activities 

 

net cash used for financing activities was 438 million in 2005 compared to 1378 million in 2004 financing activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business dividend payments share repurchases and cash received from stock option exercises 

 

in march 2005 we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit facility increasing the size of the facility from 500 million to 800 million with a term of five years the interest rate on the loans under the 800 million credit facility is libor plus 0625 interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings 

 

we are authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility we use the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper 

outstanding as of december 31 2005 we had 1447 million of commercial paper outstanding that matured within 54 days all of the commercial paper was classified as longterm as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility availability under our credit facility at december 31 2005 including outstanding commercial paper was approximately 5430 million 

 

effective following the close of business on july 31 2004 we completed the acquisition of wicor we funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with the bridge facility and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility the interest rate on the bridge facility and loans under the credit facility during the period of the bridge facility was libor plus 1375 

 

on october 4 2004 we received approximately 7968 million of proceeds from the sale of our tools group to bdk as required under the terms of the bridge facility we used the proceeds from the tools group sale and additional borrowings under the credit facility to pay off the bridge facility following payment of the bridge facility and based on our existing credit ratings the interest rate on loans under the credit facility decreased to libor plus 1125 

 

in addition to the credit facility we have 25 million of uncommitted credit facilities under which we had no borrowings as of december 31 2005 

 

our current credit ratings are as follows 

 

 

 

we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated on the other hand the ratings outlook highlights the potential direction of a short or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 

 

we issue shortterm commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by standard  poor’s or moody’s even though our shortterm commercial paper is unrated we believe a downgrade in our longterm debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 

 

we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our longterm debt by either standard  poor’s or moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets however depending upon market conditions the amount timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected if both of our longterm debt ratings were downgraded to below bbbbaa3 our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced in the event of a downgrade of our longterm debt rating the cost of borrowing and fees payable under our credit facility and 35 million private placement fixed rate note could increase while the credit facility has a pricing grid based in part on credit ratings we do not have any agreements under which the obligations are accelerated in the event of a ratings downgrade 

 

as of december 31 2005 our capital structure consisted of 7526 million in total indebtedness and 15556 million in shareholders’ equity the ratio of debttototal capital at december 31 2005 was 326 percent compared with 337 percent at december 31 2004 our targeted debttototal capital ratio is 40 percent or less 

 

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders in order to meet these cash 

requirements we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

 

we paid dividends in 2005 of 531 million compared with 431 million in 2004 and 405 million in 2003 we anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a quarterly basis 

 

in december 2004 the board of directors authorized the development of a program and process to repurchase shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of 250 million of our common stock annually there is no expiration associated with the authorization granted in 2005 we repurchased 755663 shares at 25 million under this plan as of february 17 2006 we had not repurchased any additional shares under this plan and accordingly we have the authority in 2006 to repurchase shares up to a maximum dollar limit of 25 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively we repurchased 105500 shares and 80000 shares of our common stock under similar plans 

 

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

 

 

 

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2005 variable interest rate debt was 3570 million at a weighted average interest rate of 48 

 

a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us that specifies all significant terms the purchase obligation amounts do not represent our total anticipated future purchases but represent those purchases for which we are contractually obligated as of december 31 2005 we did not have any purchase obligations requiring cash outflows of 1 million or greater per year 

 

we expect to make contributions in the range of 5 million to 10 million to our pension plans in 2006 

 

other financial measures 

 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income free cash flow and conversion of net income are nongaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt in addition free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a 

calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities 

 

 

 

in 2006 we expect free cash flow to approximate 200 million 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

 

at december 31 2005 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

 

commitments and contingencies 

 

environmental 

 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses over the last ten years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled some of the claims in 2005 and 2003 and our recorded accruals were adequate 

 

in addition there are pending environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

 

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when it is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2005 and 2004 our reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 64 million and 94 million respectively measured on an undiscounted basis we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

 

standby letters of credit 

 

in the ordinary course of business predominantly for contracts and bids involving municipal pump products we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs and certain legal matters as of december 31 2005 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 388 million as of december 31 2004 the outstanding value of these instruments 

totaled 649 million which included a 389 million standby letter of credit pertaining to an indemnified legal matter that was resolved in our favor during 2005 eliminating the bond requirement 

 

new accounting standards 

 

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 to our consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

 

  

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

 

impairment of goodwill 

 

the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates if these estimates change we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2005 we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment 

 

impairment of longlived assets 

 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets 

 

pension 

 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 11 to the consolidated financial statements changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense 

discount rate 

 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a discount rate for our us plans of 575 percent in 2005 and 2004 and 625 percent in 2003 the discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 200 to 490 in 2005 versus a range of 200 to 525 in 2004 there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2006 

 

expected rate of return 

 

the expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical tenyear compounded annual return of 90 percent with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices in 2005 the pension plan assets yielded a positive return of 42 percent compared to positive returns of 176 percent in 2004 and 248 percent in 2003 our expected rate of return in 2005 equaled 85 percent which remained unchanged from 2004 and 2003 in 2005 our expected return on plan assets was higher than our actual return on plan assets while in 2004 our expected return on plan assets was lower than our actual return on plans assets the significant difference between our expected return on plan assets compared to our actual return on plan assets in 2005 and 2004 is primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pentair common stock during the respective years there are no known or anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2006 

 

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyearperiod the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 

 

pensionrelated adjustments to equity 

 

in 2003 the financial markets recovered and resulted in a positive return on plan assets of 248 percent which eliminated 209 million of the 2002 292 million charge to shareholders’ equity the charge did not impact earnings in 2004 our discount rate was lowered from 625 percent to 575 percent however the change in the discount rate assumption was offset by higher than anticipated returns on assets and thus did not significantly affect our shareholders’ equity in 2005 the lower discount rate for our foreign plans and the lower return on plan assets resulted in an aftertax charge to equity of 57 million 

 

net periodic benefit cost 

 

total net periodic pension benefit cost was 200 million in 2005 192 million in 2004 and 157 million in 2003 total net periodic pension benefit cost is expected to be approximately 245 million in 2006 the increasing trend in net periodic pension cost from 2003 forward is largely driven by the decrease in the discount rates and by actual returns on plan assets the net periodic pension benefit cost for 2006 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 575 percent and an expected return on plan assets of 85 percent 

 

unrecognized pension losses 

 

as of our december 31 2005 measurement date our pension plans have 934 million of cumulative unrecognized losses to the extent the unrecognized loss exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation it will be amortized into expense each year on a straightline basis over the remaining expected futureworking 

lifetime of active participants currently approximating 12 years the amount included in pension expense for loss amortization in 2005 was 28 million 

 

see item 8 note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 

 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

market risk 

 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position as of december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 7690 million and 7665 million respectively 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our debt portfolio including swap agreements as of december 31 2005 was primarily comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars 99 this debt portfolio is composed of 52 fixedrate debt and 48 variablerate debt considering the effects of our interest rate swaps taking into account the variable to fixed rate swap agreement we entered with an effective date of april 2006 our debt portfolio would be comprised of 66 fixedrate debt and 34 variablerate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

 

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2005 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 35 million increase or decrease in interest incurred 

 

foreign currency risk 

 

we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates because some sales transactions and the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro we held immaterial positions in foreign exchangeforward contracts as of december 31 2005 we do not expect the effect of foreign exchange rates to have a material impact on our operations

seasonality 

we experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water segment end user demand for poolspa equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from march to july the magnitude of the sales spike is somewhat mitigated through effective use of the distribution channel by employing some advance sales programs generally including extended payment terms demand for residential water systems are also impacted by weather patterns particularly related to droughts and heavy flooding 

  

competition 

our water segment faces numerous domestic and international competitors some of which have substantially greater resources consolidation globalization and outsourcing are continuing trends in the water industry competition in commercial and residential pump markets focuses on brand names product performance quality and price while home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps they are much less important in commercial pumps for municipal pumps competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications service and price competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses on product performance and design quality delivery and price for pool and spa equipment there are a number of competitors we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing industry penetration

information regarding all business segments 

  

backlog 

our backlog of orders from continuing operations as of december 31 by segment was 

  

   

the 436 million increase in water segment backlog was primarily due to the acquisition of wicor offset by the timing of orders in our pool business the 169 million increase in enclosures segment backlog reflects 

  

order growth in our modified standard and custom enclosures business which tends to have longer leadtime orders than our component business sold through distribution due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry practice backlog which typically represents less than 30 days of shipments is not deemed to be a significant item for our business a substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month we expect that most of our backlog at december 31 2004 will be filled in 2005 

  

research and development 

we conduct research and development activities in our own facilities which consist primarily of the development of new products product applications and manufacturing processes research and development expenditures during 2004 2003 and 2002 were 315 million 229 million and 190 million respectively 

  

environmental 

environmental matters are discussed in item 3 item 7 and in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the manufacturing of our products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel electronic components plastics resins fiberglass epoxies and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials some finished goods are purchased for distribution through our sales channels 

  

the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages todate due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

  

certain commodities such as steel are subject to market and dutydriven price fluctuations we manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with escalator  deescalator clauses prices for raw materials such as steel may continue to trend higher in the future 

  

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks trade names and brand names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trade mark trade name or brand name 

  

patents patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law in accordance with their terms or otherwise we do not expect the termination of patents patent applications and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2004 pentair inc and its subsidiaries employed an aggregate of approximately 12900 people worldwide total employees in the united states were approximately 9300 of whom approximately 900 are represented by six different trade unions having collective bargaining agreements generally labor relations have been satisfactory 

  

captive insurance subsidiary 

we insure general and product liability property workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated whollyowned captive insurance subsidiary penwald insurance company penwald reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties such as liabilities retained from acquired businesses pre1992 liabilities and those of certain foreign operations are established without regard to the availability of insurance

available information 

we make available free of charge other than an investor’s own internet access charges through our internet website  httpwwwpentaircom  our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and if applicable amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the securities exchange act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to the securities and exchange commission reports of beneficial ownership filed by our directors and executive officers pursuant to section 16a of the securities exchange act of 1934 are also available on our website we are not including the information contained on our website as part of or incorporating it by reference into this annual report on form 10k 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

our principal executive office is in leased premises located in golden valley minnesota manufacturing operations are carried out at approximately 33 plants located throughout the united states and at 31 plants located in 12 other countries in addition we have approximately 65 distribution facilities and 48 sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the world we also lease one idle facility 

  

we believe that our production facilities are suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

  

we comply with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 accounting for contingencies  and related guidance and record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be reasonably estimated factors that are considered when determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met include the a nature of the litigation claim or assessment b progress of the case including progress after the date of the financial statements but before the issuance date of the financial statements c opinions of legal counsel and d management’s intended response to the litigation claim or assessment where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range we record the most likely estimate of the loss when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount however the minimum amount in the range is accrued gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 

  

while we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “legal proceedings” could change in the future

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition 

  

of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled one such claim in 2003 and our recorded accrual was adequate 

  

in addition there are pending environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

  

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when it is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2004 and 2003 our reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 94 million and 108 million respectively measured on an undiscounted basis we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

  

product liability claims 

we are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald our captive insurance subsidiary see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements — insurance subsidiary penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses for all other claims accruals covering the claims are recorded on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information the accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

  

horizon litigation 

twentyeight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs a class action and claims for indemnity by celebrity cruise lines inc celebrity were brought against essef corporation essef and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of essef in august 1999 celebrity has alleged that it had sustained economic damages due to loss of use of the mv horizon while it was drydocked 

  

the claims against essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the allegation that essef designed manufactured and marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the spa system on the horizon and allegations that the spa and filters contained legionnaire’s disease bacteria that infected certain passengers on cruises from december 1993 through july 1994 

  

the individual and class claims by passengers were tried and resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the part of the essef defendants 70 and celebrity and its sister company fantasia together 30 

  

after exhaustion of posttrial appeals we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of 70 million in the horizon cases plus interest of approximately 16 million in january 2004 we had reserved for the amount of punitive damages awarded at the time of the essef acquisition a reserve for the 16 million interest cost was recorded in 2003 

  

all of the personal injury cases have now been resolved through either settlement or trial the only remaining unresolved case is that brought by celebrity for interruption of its business in 2004 celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and costs for prior litigation and damages for outofpocket losses lost profits and loss of business enterprise value discovery commenced late in 2004 we believe our reserves for any liability to celebrity are adequate and intend to vigorously defend against these claims

overview 

we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments water and enclosures our water group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement treatment storage and enjoyment of water our enclosures group is a leader in the global enclosures market designing and manufacturing standard modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components in 2005 our water group and enclosures group are forecasted to generate approximately 75 percent and 25 percent of total revenues respectively 

  

our water segment has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from 100 million in 1995 to approximately 16 billion in 2004 or approximately 20 billion on a pro forma basis as if pentair’s water acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of 2004 the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and its large global market of which we have identified a target industry segment totaling 50 billion our vision is to become a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement treatment storage and enjoyment of water 

  

as of july 31 2004 we continued the expansion of our global footprint in the water equipment industry through the acquisition of wicor a manufacturer of pumps filtration and pool equipment marketed primarily under the starite ®  shurflo ® and hypro ® brands we funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with an 850 million committed line of credit the “bridge facility” and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility 

  

we continue to expect to achieve 30 million in synergies in the first full year of ownership with respect to the wicor acquisition via key initiatives including pims material cost savings and administrative cost savings we also expect to achieve significant working capital reductions fixed asset reductions and revenue synergies from crossselling opportunities as a result of the acquisition we have closed or consolidated nine former wicor facilities we are in the process of closing or consolidating another six facilities and will complete the construction of a new water facility in mexico in the first quarter of 2005 we expect the run rate of integration benefits to begin exceeding costs by the second quarter of 2005 

  

our enclosures segment operates in a large global market with significant headroom in industry niches such as defense security medical and networking we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and highest brand recognition in the industry from mid 2001 through mid 2003 the enclosures segment experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and overcapacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets in 2004 sales volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors new products and higher demand in all targeted markets in addition through the success of our pims and supply management initiatives we have increased enclosures segment margins for twelve consecutive quarters 

  

effective after the close of business october 2 2004 we completed the sale of our tools group to the black  decker corporation “bdk” for approximately 7968 million in cash including a 218 million interim net asset value increase subject to postclosing adjustments we used the proceeds from the tools group sale and borrowings under our credit facility to repay the 850 million bridge facility used to acquire wicor on october 4 2004 we retained certain insurance liabilities employee compensation and benefit liabilities environmental liabilities pension obligations and postretirement obligations of the tools group 

  

on may 17 2004 our board of directors approved a 2for1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on june 8 2004 to shareholders of record as of june 1 2004 all share and per share information presented in this form 10k has been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of this stock split

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments and dividend payments are generally funded from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances public and private debt and equity offerings 

  

we experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within our water segment enduser demand for poolspa equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from march to july the magnitude of the sales spike is somewhat mitigated through effective use of the distribution channel by employing some advance sales programs generally including extended payment terms demand for residential water systems are also impacted by weather patterns particularly related to droughts and heavy flooding 

  

the following table presents selected working capital measurements calculated from our monthly operating results based on a 13month moving average and indicates our emphasis on working capital management 

  

   

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 2641 million in 2004 or 12 million higher compared with the same period in 2003 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net income offset by higher levels of inventory due to inventory builds to support customers during product transfers and plant consolidation activities in water the wicor acquisition has increased our working capital ratios primarily inventory days which will continue until our postacquisition integration activities are farther along and our pims initiatives are better established 

  

in december 2004 we sold an approximate 220 million interest in a pool of accounts receivable to a thirdparty financial institution to mitigate the credit risk associated with the receivable balance of a large customer in compliance with statement of financial accounting standards no 140 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows as the estimated present value of the receivables sold approximated the carrying amount no gain or loss was recorded in 2004 

  

investing activities 

capital expenditures in 2004 2003 and 2002 were 489 million including 431 million for continuing operations 436 million including 290 million for continuing operations and 567 million including 243 million for continuing operations respectively we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 to be approximately 60 to 65 million primarily for integration of wicor businesses into existing or new facilities selective increases in equipment capacity new product development and general maintenance capital 

  

effective after the close of business october 2 2004 we completed the sale of our tools group to bdk for approximately 7968 million in cash including a 218 million interim net asset value increase subject to postclosing adjustments 

  

effective july 31 2004 we completed the acquisition of all of the shares of capital stock of wicor inc “wicor” from wisconsin energy corporation for 8711 million in cash including cash acquired of 155 million transaction costs of 58 million plus debt assumed of 216 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 we received the 140 million final purchase price adjustment related to the july 31 2004 acquisition of wicor the purchase price adjustment was a result of the final determination of closing date net assets in addition in the fourth quarter of 2004 we recorded a 03 million decrease in cash acquired and an additional 51 million in transaction costs 

  

on april 5 2004 we acquired all of the remaining stock of the tools group’s asian joint venture for 218 million in cash 64 million of which was paid following the sale of the tools group the level of return on sales targets achieved in the second quarter of 2004 required a payment of 09 million which was recorded as an increase to goodwill the acquisition included cash acquired of 62 million and debt assumed of 90 million the investment in the tools group’s asian joint venture business was sold as part of the tools group to the black  decker corporation “bdk” 

  

in the second quarter of 2004 we paid 39 million in purchase price adjustments related to the december 31 2003 acquisition of everpure inc “everpure” the adjustment primarily related to the final determination of closing date net assets 

  

in the first quarter of 2004 we paid 23 million for acquisition fees primarily related to the december 31 2003 acquisition of everpure 

  

on december 31 2003 we acquired all of the common stock of everpure from united states filter corporation a unit of veolia environnement for 2173 million in cash including cash acquired of 55 million and transaction costs of 22 million 

  

during 2003 we completed four product line acquisitions in our water segment for total consideration of approximately 214 million in cash including transaction costs 

  

in the first quarter of 2003 we received 19 million in purchase price adjustments related to our fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of plymouth products the adjustment primarily related to final determination of closing date net assets 

  

in january 2003 we paid 24 million for a final adjustment to the selling price related to the disposition of lincoln industrial this had no effect on earnings in 2003 as the amount was offset by previously established reserves 

  

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 1378 million in 2004 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of 338 million in 2003 financing activities included the utilization and repayment of the 850 million committed line of credit the “bridge facility” to fund the wicor acquisition draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business dividend payments share repurchases and cash received from stock option exercises 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had a 500 million multicurrency revolving credit facility the “credit facility” with various banks expiring on july 25 2006 on march 4 2005 we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit facility increasing the size of the facility from 500 million to 800 million with a term of five years the interest rate on the loans under the 800 million credit facility is libor plus 0625 interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings 

  

we are authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility we use the credit facility as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2004 we had 1780 million of commercial paper outstanding that matured within 44 days all of the commercial paper was classified as longterm as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis under the credit facility availability under our credit facility at december 31 2004 including outstanding commercial paper was approximately 2680 million 

  

effective following the close of business on july 31 2004 we completed the acquisition of wicor we funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the wicor acquisition with the bridge facility and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility the interest rate on the bridge facility and loans under the credit facility during the period of the bridge facility was libor plus 1375 

  

on october 4 2004 we received approximately 7968 million of proceeds from the sale of our tools group to bdk as required under the terms of the bridge facility we used the proceeds from the tools group sale and additional borrowings under the credit facility to pay off the bridge facility following payment of the bridge facility and based on our existing credit ratings the interest rate on loans under the credit facility decreased to libor plus 1125 

  

in addition to the credit facility we have 25 million of uncommitted credit facilities under which we had no borrowings as of december 31 2004 

  

our current credit ratings are as follows 

  

   

as a result of our announcement of an agreement to acquire wicor in february 2004 moody’s investor services confirmed the longterm rating for our credit facilities of baa3 and changed our outlook to negative from stable at the same time standard and poor’s rating services placed our bbb corporate credit and other ratings on creditwatch with negative implications following the completion of the sale of our tools group to bdk standard and poor’s rating services affirmed our bbb corporate credit and other ratings removed the creditwatch and changed our outlook to negative the change in rating outlook to negative from stable was a reflection of standard and poor’s concern over integration risks associated with the acquisition of wicor and an acquisitive growth strategy 

  

also in february 2004 moody’s investor services placed the baa3 senior unsecured rating on our 250 million notes and the baa3 rating on our senior notes under our 225 million shelf registration under review for possible downgrade due to structural subordination thereof existing lenders under our credit facility and private placement notes benefit from guarantees from our domestic subsidiaries while the 250 million senior note holders historically did not benefit from such guarantees in connection with the closing of the wicor acquisition our domestic subsidiaries executed a similar guarantee for the benefit of the 250 million senior note holders to avoid a downgrade due to this structural subordination 

  

on december 3 2004 moody’s affirmed our baa3 longterm debt rating and changed the outlook from negative to stable on february 24 2005 standard  poor’s revised our outlook to stable from negative and affirmed its bbb longterm debt rating 

  

we believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt a credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program the credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated on the other hand the ratings outlook highlights the potential direction of a short or longterm rating it focuses on identifiable events and shortterm trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies a change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable as a result the changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt 

  

we issue shortterm commercial paper notes which are currently not rated by standard  poor’s or moody’s even though our shortterm commercial paper is unrated we believe a downgrade in our longterm debt rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper 

  

we do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our longterm debt by either standard  poor’s or moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets however depending upon market conditions the amount timing and pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected if both of our longterm debt ratings were downgraded to below bbbbaa3 our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced in the event of a downgrade of our longterm debt rating the cost of borrowing and fees payable under our credit facility and 35 million private placement fixed rate note could increase while the credit facility has a pricing grid based in part on credit ratings we do not have any agreements under which the obligations are accelerated in the event of a ratings downgrade 

  

as of december 31 2004 our capital structure consisted of 7361 million in total indebtedness and 14478 million in shareholders’ equity the ratio of debttototal capital at december 31 2004 was 337 percent compared with 390 percent at december 31 2003 our targeted debttototal capital ratio is 40 percent or less 

  

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders in order to meet these cash requirements we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

  

dividends paid in 2004 were 431 million compared with 405 million in 2003 and 364 million in 2002 we anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a quarterly basis 

  

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

  

   

in addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt as of december 31 2004 variable interest rate debt was 3386 million at a weighted average interest rate of 36 

  

a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us that specifies all significant terms the purchase obligation amounts do not represent our total anticipated future purchases but represent those purchases for which we are contractually obligated as of december 31 2004 we did not have any purchase obligations requiring cash outflows of 1 million or greater per year 

  

we expect to make contributions in the range of 5 million to 10 million to our pension plans in 2005 

  

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income free cash flow and conversion of net income are nongaap financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income we believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt in addition free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensationbased incentives our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities 

  

   

in 2005 we expect free cash flow to approximate 200 million 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2004 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the tools group in 2004 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled one such claim in 2003 and our recorded accrual was adequate 

  

in addition there are pending environmental issues at a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

  

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2004 and 2003 our reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately 94 million and 108 million respectively measured on an undiscounted basis we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

  

standby letters of credit 

in the ordinary course of business predominantly for contracts and bids involving municipal pump products we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs and certain legal matters as of december 31 2004 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 649 million of which 389 million is a standby letter of credit pertaining to an indemnified legal matter all fees and expenses are reimbursed by the indemnifying party as of december 31 2003 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 350 million 

  

new accounting standards 

  

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 to our consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

  

   

   

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

  

impairment of goodwill 

the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated using a combination of the discounted cash flow market comparable and market capitalization approaches the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates if these estimates change we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2004 we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment 

  

impairment of longlived assets 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets 

  

pension 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 11 to the consolidated financial statements changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense 

  

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions this produced a discount rate of 575 percent in 2004 and 625 percent in 2003 and 2002 there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2005 

  

expected rate of return 

the expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical tenyear compounded annual return of 105 percent with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longerterm market indices in 2004 the pension plan assets yielded a positive return of 176 percent compared to positive returns of 248 percent in 2003 and a negative return of 105 percent in 2002 our expected rate of return in 2004 equaled 85 percent which remained unchanged from 2003 and 2002 in 2004 the significant difference between our expected return on plan assets of 280 million compared to our actual return on plan assets of 537 million was primarily due to the continued resurgence of the financial markets plus the return on pentair common stock there are no known or anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2005 

  

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyearperiod the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 

  

pensionrelated adjustments to equity 

in 2002 our discount rate was lowered from 725 percent to 625 percent and we realized a negative 105 percent return on plan assets which caused the accumulated benefit obligation to exceed the fair market value of plan assets as of december 31 2002 this unfunded accumulated benefit obligation plus the existing prepaid asset was the primary cause of a 292 million netoftax charge to shareholders’ equity for 2002 the recovery of the financial markets in 2003 and positive return on plan assets of 248 percent eliminated 209 million of the charge to shareholders’ equity the charge did not impact earnings in 2004 our discount rate was lowered from 625 percent to 575 percent however the change in the discount rate assumption was offset by higher than anticipated returns on assets and thus did not significantly affect our shareholders’ equity 

  

net periodic benefit cost 

total net periodic pension benefit cost was 192 million in 2004 157 million in 2003 and 126 million in 2002 total net periodic pension benefit cost is expected to be approximately 191 million in 2005 excluding settlement charges related to the tools group divestiture the increasing trend in net periodic pension cost from 2002 forward is largely driven by the decrease in the discount rate in 2004 and 2002 offset by actual returns on plan assets the net periodic pension benefit cost for 2005 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 575 percent and an expected return on plan assets of 85 percent 

  

unrecognized pension losses 

as of our december 31 2004 measurement date our pension plans have 767 million of cumulative unrecognized losses of which approximately 70 million relates to the use of the marketrelated value method and is not immediately subject to amortization the remaining unrecognized loss to the extent it exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation will be amortized into expense each year on a straightline basis over the remaining expected futureworking lifetime of active participants currently approximating 12 years the amount included in pension expense for loss amortization in 2004 was 05 million 

  

see item 8 note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market risk 

market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes the major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of longterm debt including current portion interest rate swaps and foreign exchangeforward contracts the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 the net financial instrument position was a liability of 7665 million and 8394 million respectively the decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the pay down of fixed rate debt in 2004 

  

we have changed the format of our market risk disclosure to more definitively illustrate the sensitivity of the company’s financial instruments to selected changes in interest rates 

  

interest rate risk 

our debt portfolio including swap agreements as of december 31 2004 was primarily comprised of debt predominantly denominated in us dollars 99 this debt portfolio is composed of 43 fixedrate debt and 57 variablerate debt considering the effects of our interest rate swaps changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixedand variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

  

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio including the interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a 42 million increase or decrease in interest incurred per year respectively 

  

foreign currency risk 

we held immaterial positions in foreign exchangeforward contracts as of december 31 2004

business segments 

  

we classify our continuing operations into the following business segments 

  

   

   

   

   

business segment and geographical financial information is contained in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

water segment 

  

strategy 

our water segment strategies are to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

seasonality 

we experience strong seasonal demand in our water segment for pool and spa equipment products in the march through july time period with some advance sales occurring in earlier months which generally include extended payment terms we also experience increased sales in our pump group during droughts and heavy flooding in north america 

  

competition 

our water segment faces numerous competitors some of which are larger and have more resources competition in commercial and residential pumps focuses on brand names product performance quality and price while home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps they are much less important in commercial pumps in municipal pumps competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications service and price competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses on product performance and design quality delivery and price in pool and spa equipment there are a number of competitors we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our existing distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing industry penetration 

  

customer concentration

enclosures segment 

  

strategy 

our enclosures segment strategies are to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

seasonality 

the enclosure segment is not significantly impacted by any seasonal demand fluctuations 

  

competition 

competition in the enclosures markets can be intense particularly in telecom and datacom markets where product design prototyping global supply and customer service are significant factors the overall global decline in market demand over the last three years has created excess capacity throughout the industry despite the retrenchment of virtually all participants in these markets the need to generate fixedcost absorption in this period of weakened demand has caused increased price competition in many markets our enclosures segment has continued to focus on cost control and improving profitability on a sequential quarter to quarter basis while 

  

many competitors have faced financial constraints and even bankruptcy stemming from significant volume declines recent growth in the enclosures segment is a result of continued channel penetration growth in targeted market segments new product development and geographic expansion consolidation globalization and outsourcing are visible trends in the enclosures marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier we believe our enclosures business has the broadest array of products available as well as the capability to deploy them globally

tools segment 

  

strategy 

our tools segment strategies are to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

seasonality 

we experience strong seasonal demand for our pressure washer product line in the march through august time period demand for woodworking machinery portable power tools accessories and compressors are strongest during spring fall and holiday promotional seasons as a result we typically experience stronger sales in the second and fourth quarters and weaker sales in the first and third quarters this seasonality also drives higher inventories and accounts receivable levels in the second and third quarters of each year 

  

competition 

the tools segment faces numerous competitors and strong distributors many of which are larger and have more resources competition in the tools segment has been intense and continues to increase especially as these industries consolidate many competitors have extensive product lines we anticipate growth to come from existing channel customers product development and continued penetration of expanding market channels 

  

competition at the enduser level focuses primarily on trade names product performance and features quality service and price the competition for shelf space at home centers and national retailers is particularly intense demanding continuing product innovation special inventory and delivery programs and competitive pricing our strategy is to be the quality leader at a competitive price in our selected markets we believe our success in maintaining our position in the marketplace is primarily due to strong trade names developing product feature innovations new products promotions and productivity gains 

  

customer concentration 

information regarding significant customers in our tools segment is contained in item 8 note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

  

information regarding all business segments 

  

backlog 

our backlog of orders from continuing operations as of december 31 by segment was 

  

   

the 325 million increase in water segment backlog was primarily due to the timing of orders in our pool business the 57 million increase in enclosures segment backlog was largely driven by the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations the 190 million increase in tools segment backlog was primarily due to the timing of orders we expect our backlog at december 31 2003 will be filled in 2004 

  

research and development 

research and development costs during 2003 2002 and 2001 were 439 million 369 million and 312 million respectively 

  

environmental 

environmental matters are discussed in item 3 item 7 and in item 8 note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the manufacturing of products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel plastic electronic components plastics and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials some finished goods are purchased for distribution through our sales channels 

  

the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments principally price commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

  

certain commodities such as steel are subject to a degree of market and dutydriven price fluctuations these fluctuations are managed through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with escalator  deescalator clauses prices for raw materials such as steel are expected to trend higher in the future 

  

distribution 

we sell products through numerous distribution channels products are sold directly to users and through numerous wholesalers retailers jobbers distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world 

  

intellectual property 

patents noncompete agreements proprietary technologies customer relationships trade marks and trade names are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent noncompete agreement proprietary technology customer relationship trade mark or trade name 

  

employees 

at the end of 2003 we employed approximately 12300 people worldwide total employees in the united states were approximately 9450 of which approximately 1200 were represented by trade unions having collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations to be very good 

  

captive insurance subsidiary 

we insure general and product liability property workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary penwald insurance company penwald reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses 

  

matters pertaining to penwald are discussed in item 3 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

 item 2 properties 

  

our corporate office is located in golden valley minnesota manufacturing operations are carried out at approximately 22 plants located throughout the united states and at 17 plants located in 10 other countries through a 49 percentowned joint venture with a long time asian tool supplier we have an interest in three additional factories in asia in addition we have approximately 23 warehouse facilities and numerous distribution facilities and sales offices we also own or lease four idle facilities 

  

we believe that our production facilities are suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to commercial disputes product liability environmental safety and health patent infringement and employment matters 

  

some of these lawsuits and proceedings raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties such as the facts and circumstances of the particular lawsuit the jurisdiction and forum in which the lawsuit is pending and the applicable law we record liabilities in those instances where we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability will likely arise 

  

we cannot always definitively determine possible liabilities that exceed recorded amounts related to the legal proceedings to which we are a party there can be no certainty that pentair may not ultimately incur charges whether related to products liability antitrust or other litigation environmental matters or other actions in excess of presently recorded liabilities however we believe it is unlikely based upon the nature of the legal proceedings and our current knowledge of relevant facts and circumstances that the possible liabilities exceeding the recorded amounts would be material individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to product liability claims such a conclusion about possible liabilities considers insurance coverage available for such liabilities 

  

while we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely given the inherent uncertainty of litigation a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact we do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation as a result the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “legal proceedings” could change in the future 

  

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 and the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we settled one such claim in 2003 and our recorded accrual was adequate 

  

in addition there are pending environmental issues concerning a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

  

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2003 our reserve for such environmental liabilities was approximately 112 million measured on an undiscounted basis we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

  

product liability claims 

as of february 8 2004 we are involved in approximately 152 product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims we believe we have in place insurance coverage adequate for our needs a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald see discussion in item 1 and item 8 note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements – insurance subsidiary accounting accruals covering the deductible portion of liability claims not covered by penwald have been established and are reviewed on a regular basis we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims 

  

horizon litigation 

twentyeight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs a class action and claims for indemnity by celebrity cruise lines inc celebrity were brought against essef corporation essef and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of essef in august 1999 these lawsuits alleged exposure to legionnaires bacteria by passengers aboard the cruise ship mv horizon a ship operated by celebrity the lawsuits included a class action brought on behalf of all passengers aboard the ship during the relevant time period individual “optout” passenger suits and a suit by celebrity celebrity alleged in its suit that it had sustained economic damages due to loss of use of the mv horizon while it was drydocked 

  

the claims against essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the allegation that essef designed manufactured and marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the spa system on the horizon and allegations that the spa and filters contained bacteria that infected certain passengers on cruises from december 1993 through july 1994 

  

prior to the acquisition of essef a settlement was reached in the class action with regard to the individual “opt out” passenger suits the claims of one plaintiff were tried under a stipulation among all remaining parties provided that the liability findings would be applicable to all plaintiffs and defendants the trial resulted in a jury verdict on june 13 2000 finding liability on the part of the essef defendants 70 and celebrity and its sister company fantasia together 30 compensatory damages in the total amount of 27 million were awarded with each defendant being accountable for its proportionate share of liability the essef defendant’s proportionate share was covered by insurance punitive damages were separately awarded against the essef defendants in the total amount of 70 million with 60 awarded to all remaining plaintiffs and 40 to celebrity 

  

after exhaustion of posttrial appeals we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of 70 million in the horizon cases plus interest of approximately 16 million in january 2004 we had reserved for the amount of punitive damages awarded at the time of the essef acquisition a reserve for the 16 million interest cost was recorded in 2003 

  

all of the personal injury cases have now been resolved through either settlement or trial the only remaining unresolved case is that brought by celebrity for interruption of its business that case had been dormant but was recently activated one of essef’s insurance carriers has issued a notice of rights letter we believe we have reserves sufficient to cover the amount of any uninsured awards or settlements 

  

ellerbrake et al v devilbiss air power company 

in august 2001 a national class action was brought against devilbiss air power company dapc and four other manufacturers of retail air compressors on behalf of consumers that had purchased certain air compressors plaintiffs alleged that the manufacturers mislabeled horsepower ratings on compressors they manufacture plaintiffs sought to represent a class of all persons who had purchased since august 1996 an air compressor for which the horsepower ratings were allegedly mislabeled 

  

without admitting any liability dapc settled with plaintiffs and the settlement was preliminarily approved by the court in january 2004 terms of the settlement include changes in labeling an education program for consumers attorney’s fees and tools or accessories for qualifying claimants while certain elements of the settlement have specific dollars assigned to them the ultimate cost of some elements is still unknown at this time we believe reserves recorded in 2003 are sufficient to cover the cost of this settlement based on the information available to us at this time

overview 

we are a focused diversified industrial manufacturer operating in three segments water enclosures and tools our water segment manufactures and markets essential products and systems used in the movement treatment storage and enjoyment of water and generates approximately 39 percent of total revenues our enclosures segment accounts for approximately 21 percent of total revenues and designs manufactures and markets standard modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components for markets that include industrial machinery data communications networking telecommunications test and measurement automotive medical security defense and general electronics our tools segment designs manufactures and markets a wide range of power tools under several well established trade names generating approximately 40 percent of total revenues 

  

our water segment has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from 100 million in 1995 to approximately 1 billion in 2003 we have identified target industry segments totaling 50 billion representing a small portion of the 350 billion global water market we continue to capitalize on growth opportunities in the water industry as evidenced by four product line acquisitions in our water segment in 2003 as well as the acquisition of everpure on december 31 2003 in february 2004 we announced our agreement to acquire wicor the completion of which would mark a dramatic shift in our water segment we anticipate that the assimilation of these acquisitions into our business operations will create a 2 billion business in the water industry 

  

our enclosures segment operates in a large global market with significant headroom in the industry niches such as defense security medical and networking we believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in north america and highest brand recognition in the industry during the past few years the enclosures segment experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial market and overcapacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets however this segment did experience growth in 2003 across the electrical and electronic markets and we believe it is wellpositioned to continue improved performance in addition through the success of our pentair integrated management system pims and supply management initiatives we have increased enclosures segment margins for the eighth sequential quarter 

  

our tools segment has been operating in a very competitive marketplace during the past few years pricing pressures and higher raw material costs have caused our operating margins to decline in february 2004 we announced our intent to explore strategic alternatives for our tools segment we will continue to operate the tools segment for the longterm and provide all appropriate management support and resources we continue to seek opportunities to expand operating margins through cost reductions and productivity improvements as part of our pims initiatives in addition we plan to continue to launch innovative new products and pursue significant incremental volume opportunities 

  

key trends and uncertainties 

the following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2003 and will likely impact our results in the future 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

business transformation 

on february 3 2004 we entered into an agreement to acquire wicor inc “wicor” a unit of wisconsin energy corporation milwaukee wisconsin wicor which manufactures water system filtration and pool equipment products under the starite shurflo and hypro brands generated sales of approximately 746 million in 2003 the 850 million cash transaction which we plan to complete in the second or third quarter of 2004 is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions and applicable regulatory approvals as part of the transaction we will assume approximately 24 million of wicor debt 

  

the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of its large global market approximating 350 billion and a growing demand for clean water our vision is to become the leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement treatment storage and enjoyment of water 

  

we expect to achieve 30 million in synergies with respect to the wicor acquisition in the first 18 months of operations via key initiatives including pims material cost savings and administrative cost savings we also expect to achieve significant working capital reductions fixed asset reductions and capital expenditure savings as a result of the acquisition 

  

we also announced that we have engaged goldman sachs to explore strategic alternatives for our tools segment comprising the portercable delta devilbiss air power company oldham saw and flex businesses with 10814 in net sales in 2003 

  

outlook 

in 2004 our operating objectives include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

financial measures 

in our management’s discussion and analysis we make reference to certain nongaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measures including gross profit operating income selling general and administrative sga income from continuing operations before income taxes and provision for income taxes in each case “excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring charges” or “excluding restructuring charge” we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they provide investors with 

  

other measures to consider in conjunction with the gaap results which may be helpful to meaningfully compare our operating performance between periods we also use these nongaap financial measures when assessing our own operating performance a description of the accounting standards applicable to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill is included below under “new accounting standards” a description of the restructuring charges that we exclude from gaap results is included below under “results of operations – restructuring charges” in each case below when we make reference to a nongaap financial measure we also provide reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure 

  

results of operations 

  

net sales 

the components of the net sales change were 

  

   

net sales in 2003 totaled 2724 million compared with 2581 million in 2002 and 2574 million in 2001 in 2003 volume increased by approximately 44 percent primarily due to increased demand in our water segment and acquisitions in both our water and tools segments price declined by approximately 10 percent driven by promotional programs for our tools segment products in addition the continued weakening of the us dollar against the euro in 2003 favorably impacted the dollar value of sales at our foreign subsidiaries by about 22 percent 

  

in 2002 volume increased by 02 percent primarily due to increased demand and acquisitions in both our tools and water segments these increases were mostly offset by the continued weak demand for our enclosures segment products price declined by 03 percent primarily due to the introduction of lower price point products and promotional programs for our tools segment products in addition the continued weakening of the us dollar in 2002 favorably impacted the dollar value of sales by about 04 percent 

  

sales by segment and the yearoveryear changes were as follows

restructuring charge 

in the fourth quarter of 2001 we initiated a restructuring program designed to consolidate manufacturing operations and eliminate noncritical support facilities in our enclosures segment we also wrote off internaluse software development costs at corporate for the abandonment of a companywide human resource system consequently we recorded a restructuring charge of 428 million of which 1 million is included in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statement of income for the writedown of inventory on certain custom enclosures product that were discontinued as a result of plant closures in the fourth quarter of 2001 we also recorded a final change in estimate related to our 2000 restructuring charge that reduced the restructuring charge by 17 million primarily due to favorable negotiation of contract termination costs as of the end of 2001 the restructuring program initiated in 2000 was complete 

  

included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets is the remaining portion of the restructuring charge liability of 33 million primarily related to severance obligations not yet paid to certain terminated individuals and other charges as we are awaiting the results of pending and threatened claims by former employees of the affected facilities therefore we are uncertain when this remaining liability will be paid payments in 2003 of 03 million are comprised of the payout of severance obligations and legal expenses funding of future payments will be paid from cash generated from operating activities 

  

see item 8 note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding restructuring charges

discontinued operationsdivestitures 

in december 2000 we adopted a plan to sell our equipment segment businesses service equipment century mfg colincoln automotive company and lincoln industrial inc lincoln industrial in october 2001 we completed the sale of the service equipment businesses to clore automotive llc for total consideration of 182 million in december 2001 we completed the sale of lincoln industrial to affiliates of the jordan company llc jordan other investors and members of management of lincoln industrial for total consideration of 784 million including a preferred stock interest the selling price of lincoln industrial was subject to a final purchase price adjustment that was finalized in january 2003 in which we paid jordan 24 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 we reported an additional loss from discontinued operations of 29 million or 006 per diluted share primarily due to a reduction in estimated proceeds related to exiting two remaining facilities 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments and dividend payments are generally funded from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances equity and debt transactions 

  

the following table presents selected working capital measurements calculated from our monthly operating results based on a 13month moving average and indicates our emphasis on working capital management 

  

   

operating activities 

operating activities provided cash flow of 2629 million in 2003 compared with 2708 million in 2002 and 2323 million in 2001 the 79 million decrease in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to smaller benefits from working capital improvements offset by an increase in net income the 385 million increase in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due an increase in net income and better working capital management 

  

investing activities 

capital expenditures in 2003 2002 and 2001 were 436 million or 16 percent of sales 567 million including 230 million for the acquisition of a previously leased facility or 22 percent of sales and 537 million or 21 percent of sales respectively we anticipate capital expenditures in 2004 to be approximately 500 million primarily in the areas of new product development and general maintenance capital 

  

on december 31 2003 we acquired all of the common stock of everpure inc everpure from united states filter corporation a unit of veolia environnement for 2173 million in cash including cash acquired of 55 million 

  

during 2003 we also completed four product line acquisitions in our water segment for total consideration of 214 million in cash hydrotemp manufacturing co inc letro products inc and certain assets of twinpumps inc and km plastics inc 

  

  

in the first quarter of 2003 we received 19 million in purchase price adjustments relative to our fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of plymouth products the adjustments primarily related to final determination of closing date net assets 

  

in january 2003 we paid 24 million for a final adjustment to the selling price related to the disposition of lincoln industrial this had no effect on earnings for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 as the amount was offset by previously established reserves 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we acquired plymouth products and oldham saw for 1747 million total consideration including debt assumed of 27 million and cash acquired of 17 million 

  

we have invested approximately 305 million to acquire a 49 percent interest in the joint venture operations of a long time asian supplier for bench top power tools of which 56 million was paid in 2003 45 million was paid in 2002 and 204 million was paid in 2001 in february 2004 we signed a letter of intent to purchase the remaining 51 percent ownership interest in this supplier 

  

we periodically review our array of businesses in comparison to our overall strategic and performance objectives as part of this review we may routinely acquire or divest certain businesses 

  

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities approximated 338 million in 2003 compared with net cash used by financing activities of 386 million in 2002 and 2229 million in 2001 financing activities in 2003 were comprised of a 200 million private placement of senior notes with 10year maturities and a new committed 500 million revolving credit facility the “credit facility” which matures in three years the 500 million credit facility replaced two existing revolving credit facilities totaling 652 million of credit availability interest rates and fees on the credit facility vary based on our credit ratings the 200 million private placement included 100 million of variable rate senior notes with an interest rate equal to the threemonth libor rate plus 115 percent and 100 million of fixed rate senior notes with an average interest rate of 498 percent we used the 200 million proceeds received in the second half of 2003 from the private placement to pay down debt under the credit facility 

  

financing activities included draw downs and repayments on the revolver to fund our operations in the normal course of business we used the revolver to fund our acquisitions of everpure for 2173 million in 2003 and plymouth products and oldham saw for 1747 million in 2002 

  

we are authorized to sell shortterm commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the credit facility the credit facility is used as backup liquidity to support 100 of commercial paper outstanding as of december 31 2003 we have 648 million of commercial paper outstanding that matures within 30 days all of the commercial paper is classified as longterm as we intend and have the ability to refinance such obligations on a longterm basis 

  

credit available under our credit facility as limited by our most restrictive financial covenant was approximately 228 million and is based on a ratio of total debt to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization in addition our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants that restrict the amount we may pay for dividends and require us to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2003 

  

in addition to the credit facility we have 55 million of uncommitted credit facilities under which we had 10 million outstanding as of december 31 2003 

  

at december 31 2003 our capital structure consisted of 8065 million in total indebtedness and 12615 million in shareholders’ equity the ratio of debttocapital was 390 percent compared with 399 percent at december 31 2002 our targeted debttototal capital ratio range is approximately 40 percent we will exceed this target from time to time as needed for operational purposes andor acquisitions 

  

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

  

   

a purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us that specifies all significant terms the purchase obligation amounts do not represent our total anticipated future purchases but represent those purchases for which we are contractually obligated as of december 31 2003 we did not have any purchase obligations requiring cash outflows of 1 million or greater per year 

  

dividends paid in 2003 were 405 million compared with 364 million in 2002 and 343 million in 2001 the yearoveryear increases reflect an increase in our annual pershare dividend of 082 in 2003 compared with 074 in 2002 and 070 in 2001 we have paid dividends for the past 28 years and anticipate paying future dividends 

  

on february 4 2004 we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire wicor inc “wicor” a unit of wisconsin energy corporation milwaukee wisconsin we expect to fund the wicor acquisition through our currently available and newly committed lines of credit we have obtained a commitment subject to customary conditions in the aggregate amount of 850 million the “bridge facility” for the payment of the purchase price the bridge facility is available for a period up to the earlier of i september 1 2004 ii the closing of the acquisition without the use of the bridge facility or iii the sale of the pentair tools group 

  

the term loan to be made under the bridge facility the “loan” pursuant to a formal loan agreement to be negotiated is contemplated to be available in a single disbursement upon closing of the wicor acquisition and is for the purpose of payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses the closing of the loan must occur before september 1 2004 any balance due under the loan is repayable in full with accrued interest no later than december 31 2004 we will need to fund the repayment of the bridge facility by december 31 2004 through a disposition of our tools group or through equity issuance 

  

as a result of our announcement of an agreement to acquire wicor see note 18 moody’s investor services has confirmed our longterm bank rating of baa3 and changed the outlook to negative from stable at the same time standard and poor’s rating services has placed our bbb corporate credit and other ratings on creditwatch with negative implications the change in rating outlook to negative from stable reflects the increased financial and integration risks associated with the planned acquisition of wicor in addition the timing and nature of any outcome resulting from the exploration of strategic alternatives for the tools segment remains uncertain and 

  

subject to execution risk in a related action moody’s investor services placed the baa3 senior unsecured rating on our 250 million notes and the baa3 rating on senior notes under our 225 million shelf registration under review for possible downgrade due to the structural subordination thereof existing lenders under our credit facility and private placement notes benefit from guarantees from our domestic subsidiaries while the 250 million senior note holders do not benefit from such guarantees we are putting in place a similar guarantee for the benefit of the 250 million senior note holders to avoid the downgrade due to the structural subordination 

  

we are seeking to obtain an amendment to the credit facility to allow an increase to the ratio of total debt to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for the period of the bridge facility which we believe will be granted by the banks participating in our credit facility in addition during the period the bridge facility is outstanding additional limitations will be placed on share repurchases dividends acquisitions and sales of assets 

  

in 2004 interest expense will be primarily driven by the timing of the closing of the wicor acquisition and any strategic alternative we pursue for our tools segment 

  

we expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders in order to meet these cash requirements we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities 

  

longterm debt and lines of credit are explained in detail in item 8 note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements operating leases are explained in detail in item 8 note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income we believe our ability to convert net income into free cash flow gives us opportunities to invest in new growth initiatives to create shareholder value we believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions and repay debt in addition free cash flow is used as criteria to measure and pay compensationbased incentives the following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow with cash flows from operating activities 

  

   

before any effects of our planned acquisition of wicor we expect 2004 free cash flow to exceed 200 million 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2003 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis 

  

status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 and the disposition of lincoln industrial in 2001 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities we have recently settled one such claim in 2003 and our recorded accrual was adequate 

  

in addition there are pending environmental issues concerning a limited number of sites including one site acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

  

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2003 our reserve for such environmental liabilities was approximately 112 million measured on an undiscounted basis we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

  

standby letters of credit 

in the ordinary course of business predominantly in our pumps business we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any nonperformance the outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog in addition we issue financial standby letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs and certain legal matters as of december 31 2003 and 2002 the outstanding value of these instruments totaled 350 million and 198 million respectively 

  

new accounting standards 

  

see item 8 note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are more fully described in item 8 note 1 to our consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

  

   

   

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

  

impairment of goodwill 

the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow market comparable and market capitalization approaches the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates if these estimates change we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of 2003 we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment 

  

impairment of longlived assets including cost and equity method investments 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets 

  

at the end of 2003 we have 574 million invested in certain privately held companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods we write down or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is otherthantemporary this requires significant judgment including assessment of the investees’ financial condition and in certain cases the possibility of subsequent rounds of financing as well as the investees’ historical results of operations and projected results and cash flows if the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from projections we may incur future charges for the impairment of these investments 

  

pension 

we sponsor domestic and foreign definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our definedbenefit pension and other postretirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets discount rates rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in item 8 note 12 to the consolidated financial statements changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense 

  

discount rate 

the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of year based on our december 31 measurement date the discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions as a relatively young company with a longer duration of liabilities than older companies with more mature workforces this produced a discount rate of 625 percent there are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2004 a 25 basis point decrease increase in our discount rate holding constant our expected longterm return on plan assets and other assumptions would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 14 million per year we elected to utilize a 25 basis point hypothetical change as the assumption difference to demonstrate the sensitivity of our pension expense to a change in the discount rate 

  

expected rate of return 

the expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a longterm assumption that may be subject to considerable yeartoyear variance from actual returns in developing the expected longterm rate of return we considered our historical ten year compounded return of 95 percent with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions our asset allocations input from external consultants and broader longer term market indices in 2003 the pension plan assets yielded a positive return of 248 percent compared to negative returns of 105 percent and 41 percent in 2002 and 2001 respectively our expected rate of return in 2003 equaled 85 percent which remained unchanged from 2002 and 2001 in 2003 the significant difference between our expected return on plan assets of 247 million compared to our actual return on plan assets of 555 million was primarily due to the economic recovery and the resurgence of the financial markets there are no known or anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2004 a one percent decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets assumption holding constant our discount rate and other assumptions would increase decrease pension expense by approximately 31 million per year we elected to use a one percent hypothetical change as the assumption difference facilitates extrapolation of changes in the expected rate of return assumption 

  

we base our determination of pension expense or income on a marketrelated valuation of assets which reduces yeartoyear volatility this marketrelated valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a fiveyear period from the year in which they occur investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the marketrelated value of assets and the actual return based on the marketrelated value of assets since the marketrelated value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a fiveyearperiod the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 

  

pensionrelated adjustments to equity 

in 2002 our discount rate was lowered from 725 percent to 625 percent and we realized a negative 105 percent return on plan assets which caused the accumulated benefit obligation to exceed the fair market value of plan assets as of december 31 2002 this unfunded accumulated benefit obligation plus the existing prepaid asset was the primary cause of a 292 million netoftax charge to shareholders’ equity for 2002 the recovery of the financial markets in 2003 and positive return on plan assets of 248 percent eliminated 209 million of the charge to shareholders’ equity the charge did not impact earnings 

  

net periodic benefit cost 

total net periodic pension benefits cost was 157 million in 2003 126 million in 2002 and 106 million in 2001 total net periodic pension benefits cost is expected to be approximately 170 million in 2004 the increasing trend in net periodic pension cost from 2001 forward is largely driven by the downturn in the financial markets in 2002 and 2001 and the decrease in the discount rate in 2002 the net periodic pension benefit cost for 2004 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 625 percent and an expected return on plan assets of 85 percent 

  

unrecognized pension losses 

as of december 31 2003 measurement date our pension plans have 757 million of cumulative unrecognized losses of which approximately 20 million relates to the use of the market related value method and is not immediately subject to amortization the remaining unrecognized loss to the extent it exceeds 10 of the projected benefit obligation will be amortized into expense each year on a straightline basis over the remaining expected futureworking lifetime of active participants currently approximately 12 years the amount included in pension expense for loss amortization in 2003 was 05 million 

  

 pension contributions in 2003 total 191 million including 151 million of contributions to domestic defined benefit pension plans in 2002 pension contributions totaled 189 million including 153 million of contributions to domestic defined benefit plans the contributions in 2003 and 2002 exceeded the minimum funding requirement our 2004 pension contributions are expected to be in the range of 10 million to 15 million 

  

asset allocation 

our actual overall asset allocation for the plans as compared to our investment policy goals is as follows 

  

   

   

we regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate our cash balance is higher than normal due to a 151 million contribution made to our domestic defined benefit plans as of december 31 2003 from time to time we may be outside our targeted ranges by amounts we deem acceptable 

  

equity securities include pentair common stock in the amount of 216 million 8 percent of total plan assets and 163 million 7 percent of total plan assets at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively

tools segment 

  

strategy 

our tools segment strategies are to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

seasonality 

we experience strong seasonal demand for our pressure washer product line in the march through august time period demand for woodworking machinery portable power tools accessories and compressors are strongest during spring and fall promotional events as a result we typically experience stronger sales in the second and fourth quarters and weaker sales in the first and third quarters this seasonality also drives higher inventories and accounts receivable levels in the second and third quarters of each year 

  

competition 

the tools segment faces numerous competitors and strong distributors many of which are larger and have more resources competition in the tools segment has been intense and continues to increase especially as these industries consolidate in most markets only a few large players remain each having extensive product lines we anticipate growth to come from product development continued penetration of expanding market channels and acquisitions especially in the accessories arena 

  

competition at the enduser level focuses primarily on brand names product performance and features quality service and price the competition for shelf space at home centers and national retailers is particularly intense demanding continuing product innovation special inventory and delivery programs and competitive pricing our strategy is to be the pricequality leader in our selected markets we believe our success in maintaining our position in the marketplace is primarily due to strong brands developing product feature innovations new products promotions and productivity gains 

  

customer concentration

water segment 

  

strategy 

our water segment strategies are to 

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

seasonality 

we experience strong seasonal demand in our water segment for pool and spa equipment products in the march through july time period with some advance sales occurring in earlier months which generally include extended payment terms as the installed base grows throughout north america and europe the selling season tends to lengthen 

  

competition 

our water segment faces numerous competitors some of which are larger and have more resources competition in the commercial and residential pump markets focuses on brand names product performance quality and price while home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps they are much less important in commercial pump markets in municipal pump markets competition focuses on performance to required specification service and price competition in the water treatment and filtration component markets focuses on product performance and design quality delivery and price in the pool and spa equipment market there are a number of competitors only a few of which have as broad of a product line as ours we compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and highquality products which are competitively priced we believe our existing distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing market penetration 

  

customer concentration

enclosures segment 

  

strategy 

our enclosures segment strategies are to 

  

   

   

   

   

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

competition 

competition in the enclosures markets can be intense particularly in telecom and datacom markets where product design prototyping global supply and customer service are significant factors the overall global decline in market demand over the last two years has created excess capacity throughout the industry despite the retrenchment of virtually all participants in these markets the need to generate fixedcost absorption in this period of weakened demand has caused increased price competition in many markets in 2002 our enclosures segment focused on cost control during a period of flat demand which improved profitability on a sequential quarter to quarter basis while many competitors faced financial constraints and even bankruptcy stemming from significant volume declines future growth in the enclosures segment will likely come from continued channel penetration growth in targeted market segments new product development and geographic expansion consolidation globalization and outsourcing are visible trends in the enclosures marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier we believe our enclosures business has the broadest array of products available as well as the capability to deploy them globally 

  

information regarding all business segments 

  

backlog 

our backlog of orders from continuing operations as of december 31 by segment was 

  

   

the 24 million increase in tools segment backlog was primarily due to the 2002 acquisition of oldham saw and the timing of orders the 41 million increase in water segment backlog was primarily due to the 2002 acquisition of plymouth products the 171 million decline in enclosures segment backlog reflects the downturn in the datacom and telecom markets and the change in customer order patterns reverting from placing large program orders necessary during a market upswing to ensure position in the build schedule back to placing smaller orders with shorter lead times we expect that our backlog at december 31 2002 will be filled in 2003 

  

research and development 

research and development costs during 2002 2001 and 2000 were 369 million 312 million and 312 million respectively 

  

environmental 

matters pertaining to the environment are discussed in item 3 item 7 and in item 8 note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

  

raw materials 

the principal materials used in the manufacturing of products are electric motors mild steel stainless steel plastic electronic components and paint powder and liquid in addition to the purchase of raw materials some finished goods are purchased for distribution through our sales channels 

  

the materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply we have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials we have certain longterm commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which longterm commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations 

  

in our tools segment we have invested approximately 25 million to acquire a 40 percent interest in certain joint venture operations of a longtime asian tool supplier which supplies us with a large portion of our bench top power tools see also item 8 note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

certain commodities such as steel are subject to a degree of market and dutydriven price fluctuations these fluctuations are managed through several mechanisms including longterm agreements with escalator  deescalator clauses 

  

intellectual property 

patents trademarks and proprietary technology are important to our business however we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent trademark or technology 

  

employees 

at the end of 2002 we employed approximately 11900 people worldwide total employees in the united states were approximately 9300 of which approximately 850 were represented by trade unions having collective bargaining agreements we consider our employee relations to be very good

 item 2 properties 

  

our corporate office is located in st paul minnesota manufacturing operations are carried out at approximately 20 plants located throughout the united states and at 14 plants located in 11 other countries through a 40 percentowned joint venture with a longtime asian tool supplier we have an interest in four additional factories in asia we also own or lease six other facilities that have been closed of which five are located in the united states and one in scotland in addition we have approximately 23 warehouse facilities and numerous sales and service offices throughout the world 

  

we believe that our production facilities are suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business including those pertaining to product liability environmental safety and health 

  

patent infringement and employment matters we believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or future results of operations 

  

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 as well as the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities 

  

in addition there are pending environmental issues concerning a limited number of sites including one site in los angeles california this was acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 and relates to operations no longer carried out at that site we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

  

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2002 our reserve for such environmental liabilities was approximately 10 million we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

  

product liability claims 

as of february 28 2003 we are defendants in approximately 120 product liability lawsuits and have been notified of approximately 140 additional claims we continue to have in place insurance coverage deemed adequate for our needs a substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by penwald insurance company penwald a regulated insurance company wholly owned by pentair see discussion in item 8 note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements – insurance subsidiary accounting accruals covering the deductible portion of liability claims not covered by penwald have been established and are reviewed on a regular basis we have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability claims 

  

horizon litigation 

twentyeight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs a class action and claims for indemnity by celebrity cruise lines inc celebrity were brought against essef corporation essef and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition in august 1999 these lawsuits alleged exposure to legionnaires bacteria by passengers aboard the cruise ship mv horizon a ship operated by celebrity the lawsuits included a class action brought on behalf of all passengers aboard the ship during the relevant time period individual “optout” passenger suits and a suit by celebrity celebrity alleges in its suit that it has sustained economic damages due to loss of use of the mv horizon while it was drydocked 

  

the claims against essef and its involved subsidiaries are based upon the allegation that essef designed manufactured and marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the spa system on the horizon and allegations that the spa and filters contained bacteria that infected certain passengers on cruises from december 1993 through july 1994 

  

  

prior to our acquisition of essef a settlement was reached in the class action with regard to the individual “optout” passenger suits the claims of one plaintiff were tried under a stipulation among all remaining parties providing that the liability findings would be applicable to all plaintiffs and defendants the claims of this plaintiff were unusual because he alleged that he developed complications that profoundly impaired his mental functioning no other plaintiff asserted similar claims 

  

the trial resulted in a jury verdict on june 13 2000 finding liability on the part of the essef defendants 70 and celebrity and its sister company fantasia together 30 compensatory damages in the total amount of 27 million were awarded each defendant being accountable for its proportionate share of liability the essef defendants’ proportionate share is covered by insurance punitive damages were separately awarded against the essef defendants in the total amount of 7 million with 60 awarded to all remaining plaintiffs and 40 to celebrity the essef defendant filed posttrial motions challenging the verdict which were denied in february 2002 and has subsequently filed an appeal to the united states court of appeal for the second circuit 

  

all of the remaining individual cases have been resolved through either settlement or trial the only remaining unresolved case is that brought by celebrity for interruption of its business that case has been placed on hold pending a resolution of posttrial motions 

  

at the current time we are optimistic that remaining suits will be resolved within available insurance coverage with regard to celebrity’s claim against essef westchester one of essef’s insurance carriers has issued a notice of rights letter we believe we have reserves sufficient to cover the amount of any uninsured awards or settlements

general 

  

we are a diversified industrial manufacturer operating in three segments tools water and enclosures our tools segment manufactures and markets a wide range of power tools under several brand names generating approximately 40 percent of total revenues our water segment manufactures and markets essential products for 

  

the transport storage and treatment of water and wastewater and generates approximately 35 percent of total revenues our enclosures segment accounts for approximately 25 percent of total revenues and designs manufactures and markets standard modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components for markets that include industrial machinery data communications networking telecommunications test and measurement automotive medical security defense and general electronics 

  

in our management’s discussion and analysis we make reference to certain nongaap generally accepted accounting principles financial measures including gross profit operating income selling general and administrative sga income from continuing operations before income taxes and provision for income taxes in each case “excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring charges” or “excluding restructuring charge” we believe that these nongaap financial measures are useful to investors because they provide investors with another measure to consider in conjunction with the gaap results that may be helpful to meaningfully compare our operating performance between periods we also use these nongaap financial measures when assessing our own operating performance a description of the accounting standards applicable to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill is included below under “new accounting standards” a description of the restructuring charges that we exclude from gaap results is included below under “results of operations – restructuring charges” in each case below when we make reference to a nongaap financial measure we also provide a reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure

net sales in 2002 totaled 2581 million compared with 2574 million in 2001 and 2706 million in 2000 in 2002 volume increased by approximately 02 percent primarily due to increased demand and acquisitions in both our tools and water segments these increases were mostly offset by the continued weak demand for our enclosures segment products price declined by approximately 03 percent primarily due to the introduction of lower price point products and promotional discounting for our tools segment products in addition the continued weakening of the us dollar in 2002 favorably impacted the dollar value of sales by about 04 percent the 49 percent or 132 million decline in net sales in 2001 compared to 2000 reflected volume declines in each of our businesses resulting from a weak global economy and a stronger us dollar which reduced the dollar value of foreign sales by about 05 percent 

  

sales by segment and the yearoveryear changes were as follows 

  

   

  

tools 

the 91 percent increase in tools segment sales in 2002 was primarily due to 

  

   

   

   

these increases were partially offset by 

  

   

the 27 percent decline in tools segment sales in 2001 was primarily due to 

  

   

water 

the 56 percent increase in water segment sales in 2002 was primarily due to 

  

   

   

   

the 17 percent decline in water segment sales in 2001 was primarily due to 

  

   

enclosures 

the 194 percent decline in enclosures segment sales in 2002 was primarily due to 

  

   

the 113 percent decline in enclosures segment sales in 2001 was primarily due to 

  

   

gross profit 

the following table and discussion provides a comparison of our gross profit 

  

   

   

gross profit margin was 239 percent in 2002 compared with 235 percent in 2001 and 242 percent in 2000 

  

  

the 04 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily the result of 

  

   

   

   

these increases were partially offset by 

  

   

   

the 07 percentage point decline in gross profit as a percent of sales in 2001 from 2000 was primarily the result of 

  

   

selling general and administrative sga 

the following table and discussion provides a comparison of sga expense as reported and those results excluding goodwill amortization 

  

   

sga expense was 133 percent of sales or flat when compared with 2001 this was primarily the result of lower spending for process improvement investments in 2002 mostly offset by higher bad debt expense 

  

sga expense in 2001 was 132 percent of sales or essentially flat when compared with 2000 however sga expense in 2000 included 22 million to establish additional bad debt reserves excluding this amount sga expense as a percent of sales in 2000 was 125 percent of sales the 08 percentage point increase in 2001 from 2000 excluding the 22 million reserve adjustment was primarily the result of higher investments in 2001 to redefine and streamline companywide business processes in the areas of supply chain management and lean enterprise in addition enclosures segment sales declined at a much faster rate than the decrease in their sga expense 

  

research and development rd 

  

   

rd expense as a percent of sales was 14 percent in 2002 compared with 12 percent in both 2001 and 2000 the 02 percentage point increase in 2002 over 2001 was primarily the result of additional investments related to new product development initiatives in our tools and water segments 

  

  

restructuring charges 

2000 restructuring charge 

to reduce costs and improve productivity and accountability we initiated a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2000 to decentralize corporate service functions and reorganize our tools segment infrastructure as a result we recorded a restructuring charge of 268 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a final change in estimate that reduced the restructuring charge by 17 million primarily due to favorable negotiation of contract termination costs as of the end of 2001 this restructuring program was complete 

  

2001 restructuring charge 

in the fourth quarter of 2001 we initiated a restructuring program designed to consolidate manufacturing operations and eliminate noncritical support facilities in our enclosures segment we also wrote off internaluse software development costs at corporate for the abandonment of a companywide human resource system consequently we recorded a restructuring charge of 428 million of which 1 million is included in cost of goods sold on the consolidated statement of income for the writedown of inventory on certain custom enclosures product that were discontinued as a result of plant closures 

  

the major components of the 2000 and 2001 restructuring charges and remaining restructuring liability follows 

  

   

included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets is the unused portion of the restructuring charge liability of 36 million primarily related to severance obligations not yet paid to certain terminated individuals and other charges as we are awaiting the results of pending and threatened litigation proceedings and therefore are uncertain when this remaining liability will be paid funding of future payments will be paid from cash generated from operating activities 

  

as a result of our 2000 restructuring charge program we reduced our workforce by approximately 225 employees workforce reductions related to the 2001 restructuring charge are for approximately 884 employees of whom 867 were terminated in 2001 and 2002 employee termination benefits consist primarily of severance and outplacement counseling fees employee termination benefits for the 2001 restructuring charge includes a 04 million noncash charge for the intrinsic value of stock options modified as part of a severance agreement 

  

noncash asset disposals for the 2000 and 2001 restructuring charges were for the writedown of equipment leasehold improvements and inventory 2001 only as a direct result of our decisions to exit certain facilities and the abandonment of internal use software under development exit costs are primarily related to contract and lease termination costs 

  

  

the following table summarizes the components of the 2000 and 2001 restructuring charges by segment net of changes in estimates 

  

   

operating income 

  

tools 

the following table and discussion provides a comparison of our tools segment operating income as reported and those results excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring charge 

  

   

percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

  

the 17 percentage point increase in tools segment 2002 operating income as a percent of net sales was primarily due to 

  

   

   

   

the 35 percentage point increase in tools segment 2001 operating income as a percent of net sales was primarily due to 

  

   

these increases were partially offset by 

  

   

  

water 

the following table and discussion provides a comparison of our water segment operating income as reported and those results excluding goodwill amortization 

  

   

percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

  

the 09 percentage point decline in water segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2002 was primarily due to 

  

   

   

   

the 10 percentage point decline in water segment operating income in 2001 as a percent of net sales was primarily due to 

  

   

enclosures 

the following table and discussion provides a comparison of our enclosures segment operating income as reported and those results excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring charges 

  

   

percentages may reflect rounding adjustments 

  

the 18 percentage point decline in enclosures segment 2002 operating income as a percent of net sales was primarily due to 

  

   

the 61 percentage point decline in enclosures segment 2001 operating income as a percent of net sales was primarily due to 

  

   

  

other expense 

in 2001 we incurred a noncash charge of 30 million primarily for the writeoff of our businesstobusiness ecommerce equity investment that we made in early 2000 

  

net interest expense 

  

   

net interest expense was 435 million in 2002 compared with 615 million in 2001 and 749 million in 2000 the yearoveryear declines in net interest expense reflects lower average borrowings driven by our strong cash flow performance in both 2002 and 2001 and lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 

  

provision for income taxes 

the following table and discussion provides a comparison of our provision for income taxes as reported and those results excluding goodwill amortization 

  

   

our effective tax rate on continuing operations excluding goodwill amortization was 325 percent in 2002 compared with 308 percent in 2001 and 301 percent in 2000 the 17 percentage point increase in 2002 from 2001 primarily reflects an increased percentage of earnings taxed in countries with higher marginal rates the 07 percentage point increase in 2001 from 2000 primarily reflects nondeductible amounts related to the 2001 restructuring charge 

  

we expect our effective tax rate on continuing operations to be 34 percent in 2003 

  

discontinued operationsdivestitures 

in december 2000 we adopted a plan to sell our equipment segment businesses service equipment century mfg colincoln automotive company and lincoln industrial inc lincoln industrial in october 2001 we completed the sale of the service equipment businesses to clore automotive llc for total consideration of 182 million in december 2001 we completed the sale of lincoln industrial to affiliates of the jordan company llc jordan other investors and members of management of lincoln industrial for total consideration of 784 million including a preferred stock interest the selling price of lincoln industrial was subject to a final purchase price adjustment that was finalized in january 2003 in which we paid jordan 24 million 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures equity investments acquisitions debt repayments and dividend payments are generally funded from cash generated from operations availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances equity and public debt transactions 

  

  

the following table presents selected working capital measurements calculated from our monthly operating results based on a 13month moving average and indicates our emphasis on working capital management 

  

   

operating activities 

operating activities provided cash flow of 2708 million in 2002 compared with 2323 million in 2001 and 1849 million in 2000 the 385 million increase in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due an increase in net income and better working capital management the 474 million increase in 2001 from 2000 was primarily due to an emphasis on better management of accounts receivable and inventories somewhat offset by the decrease in accounts payable and the decline in net income 

  

investing activities 

capital expenditures in 2002 2001 and 2000 were 567 million including 230 million for the acquisition of a previously leased facility or 22 percent of sales 537 million or 21 percent of sales and 680 million or 25 percent of sales respectively we anticipate capital expenditures in 2003 to be approximately 450 primarily in the areas of new product development and general maintenance capital 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we acquired plymouth products and oldham saw for 1703 million cash net of cash acquired plus debt assumed of 26 million the acquisitions are subject to final purchase price adjustments 

  

we have invested approximately 249 million to acquire a 40 percent interest in certain joint venture operations of an asian supplier for bench top tools of which 204 million was paid for in the year ended december 31 2001 and an additional 45 million was paid in 2002 we hold options to increase our ownership interest in these joint ventures to 100 percent 

  

in the first quarter of 2001 we acquired taunus a brazilian enclosures manufacturer for 69 million the acquisition was financed through borrowings under our credit facilities in the second quarter of 2001 we received 50 million for the settlement of a purchase price dispute related to a 1999 acquisition the amount received was accounted for as a reduction of goodwill 

  

we periodically review our array of businesses in comparison to our overall strategic and performance objectives as part of this review we may routinely acquire or divest certain businesses 

  

financing activities 

at december 31 2002 our capital structure consisted of 7351 million in total indebtedness and 11057 million in shareholders’ equity the ratio of debttototal capital was 399 percent compared with 416 percent at december 31 2001 our targeted debttototal capital ratio range is approximately 40 percent we will exceed this target from time to time as needed for operational purposes andor acquisitions 

  

the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity 

  

   

  

longterm debt and lines of credit are explained in detail in item 8 note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements operating leases are explained in detail in item 8 note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  

as of december 31 2002 we had 652 million in committed revolving credit facilities the facilities with various banks consisting of a 242 million 364day facility that expires on august 28 2003 and 410 million of multicurrency facilities of which 20 million expires on august 8 2004 and 390 million expires on september 2 2004 interest rates and fees on the facilities vary based on our credit ratings 

  

we believe we will be able to pay or refinance debt coming due in the near term through cash generated from operations combined with our ability to borrow as necessary in the financial markets 

  

our current credit ratings are as follows 

  

   

the weightedaverage interest rate for borrowings under the facilities during 2002 and 2001 was 309 percent and 552 percent respectively credit available under existing facilities as limited by our most restrictive financial covenant was approximately 227 million and is based on a ratio of total debt to ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization in addition our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants that restrict the amount we pay for dividends and require us to maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth we were in compliance with all covenants as of december 31 2002 

  

in addition to the facilities we have 400 million of uncommitted credit facilities under which we had 07 million outstanding as of december 31 2002 

  

in 2002 we issued financial standby letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under selfinsurance programs certain legal matters and other commitments in the ordinary course of business as of december 31 2002 we had standby letters of credit outstanding of 167 million 

  

dividends paid in 2002 were 364 million compared with 343 million in 2001 and 320 million in 2000 the yearoveryear increases reflect an increase in our annual pershare dividend of 074 in 2002 compared with 070 in 2001 and 066 in 2000 we have paid dividends for the past 27 years and anticipate paying future dividends 

  

we believe cash generated from operating activities together with credit available under committed and uncommitted facilities and our current cash position will provide adequate shortterm and longterm liquidity 

  

other financial measures 

in addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating investing and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows we also measure our free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures including both continuing and discontinued operations free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a longterm goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds a 100 percent conversion of net income we believe our ability to convert net income into free cash flow gives us opportunities to invest in new growth initiatives to create shareholder value in 2002 we generated free cash flow of 2141 million compared with 1787 million in 2001 and 1169 million in 2000 

  

  

offbalance sheet financing 

at december 31 2001 we were a party to a synthetic leasing arrangement for a distribution center and office building in our tools segment the lease qualified as an operating lease for accounting purposes and the value of the underlying asset and related debt was offbalance sheet in the fourth quarter of 2002 we terminated this offbalance sheet financing arrangement and purchased the related facilities for 23 million at december 31 2002 we had no offbalance sheet financing arrangements 

  

commitments and contingencies 

  

environmental 

we have been named as defendants targets or potentially responsible parties prps in a small number of environmental cleanups in which our current or former business units have generally been given de minimis status to date none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs fines penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations we have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases such as the disposition of the cross pointe paper corporation uncoated paper business in 1995 as well as the disposition of the federal cartridge company ammunition business in 1997 we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations we have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities 

  

in addition there are pending environmental issues concerning a limited number of sites including one site in los angeles california this was acquired in the acquisition of essef corporation in 1999 and relates to operations no longer carried out at that site we have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites we do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability 

  

we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future for both divested and acquired businesses when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states as of december 31 2002 our reserve for such environmental liabilities was approximately 10 million we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 

  

new accounting standards 

  

effective january 1 2002 we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 019 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor’s products  this new standard requires that certain payments to our customers for cooperative advertising and certain sales incentive offers that were historically classified as selling general and administrative expense be reclassified and shown as a reduction in net sales eitf issue no 019 also requires the reclassification of previously reported results of operations for periods prior to the adoption to conform to the current presentation accordingly previously reported net sales for 2001 and 2000 were reduced by 419 million and 424 million with an offsetting reduction in selling expense respectively the adoption of this new standard had no impact on previously reported operating income net income or earnings per share 

  

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  this statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life the statement requires a test for impairment to be performed annually or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist we adopted the provisions of sfas no 142 effective january 1 2002 and as a result no longer record goodwill amortization an initial assessment of the recoverability of goodwill recorded on the date of adoption was completed in the second 

  

quarter of 2002 additionally we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2002 no impairment was present upon performing either of the 2002 impairment tests the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow market comparable and market capitalization approaches 

  

had we accounted for goodwill under sfas no 142 for all prior periods presented our net income and earnings per share from continuing operations would have been as follows 

  

   

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations  this new standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development andor the normal operation of a longlived asset except for certain obligations of lessees sfas no 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june 15 2002 we will adopt sfas no 143 on january 1 2003 and have determined that the adoption of this new standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  this standard supersedes sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of  however it retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of longlived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations it also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale sfas no 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 the adoption of sfas no 144 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 62 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections  this new standard will require gains and losses on the extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas no 4 extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in accounting principles board apb opinion no 30 sfas no 145 also amends 

  

sfas no 13 to require certain modifications to capital leases to be treated as a saleleaseback and modifies the accounting for subleases when the original lessee remains a secondary obligor or guarantor sfas no 145 is effective for financial statements issued after may 15 2002 and with respect to the impact of the reporting requirements of changes made to sfas no 4 for fiscal years beginning after may 15 2002 the adoption of these provisions did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations pentair will adopt the remaining provisions of sfas no 145 in 2003 we do not expect the adoption of the remaining provisions will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  this new standard nullifies eitf issue no 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  sfas no 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a disposal activity covered by sfas no 144 be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan sfas no 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december 31 2002 with earlier application encouraged we will adopt sfas no 146 on january 1 2003 we do not expect that sfas no 146 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation — transition and disclosure — an amendment of fasb statement no 123  sfas no 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation in addition sfas no 148 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results pentair will continue to account for stockbased compensation in accordance with apb opinion no 25 as such we do not expect this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations we adopted the disclosureonly provisions of sfas no 148 at december 31 2002 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation no 45 guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  interpretation no 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees including loan guarantees it also clarifies that at the time an entity issues a guarantee the issuing entity must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee however the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor’s obligations does not apply to product warranties guarantees accounted for as derivatives or other guarantees of an entity’s own future performance we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december 31 2002 the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 we have not yet determined the effect of adopting the initial recognition and measurement provisions on pentair’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities vie an interpretation of arb no 51  which requires all vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the vie in addition the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both vies that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests but not the majority the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for all financial statements issued after january 31 2003 the consolidation requirements of this interpretation are effective for all periods beginning after june 15 2003 we do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have any effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty these judgments are based on our historical experience terms of existing contracts our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources as appropriate we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 

  

   

   

our critical accounting estimates include the following 

  

impairment of goodwill 

in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill effective january 1 2002 we performed our initial assessment test and also completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and found no impairment the fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow market comparable and market capitalization approaches the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates if these estimates change we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 

  

impairment of longlived assets including cost and equity method investments 

we review the recoverability of longlived assets to be held and used such as property plant and equipment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value impairment losses on longlived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of longlived assets 

  

at the end of 2002 we have 538 million invested in certain privately held companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods we write down or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is otherthantemporary this requires significant judgment including assessment of the investees’ financial condition and in certain cases the possibility of subsequent rounds of financing as well as the investees’ historical results of operations and projected results and cash flows if the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from projections we may incur future charges for the impairment of these investments 

  

pension 

during 2002 asset returns for our us domestic defined benefit pension plans were adversely affected by continued deterioration in the equity markets in addition interest rates have declined which resulted in a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure these plans from 725 percent in 2001 to 625 percent in 2002 the lower asset returns and discount rates have unfavorably impacted the 2002 yearend funded status and increased our pension expense and plan contributions 

  

  

the decrease in the discount rate caused an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation and the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair market value of plan assets at december 31 2002 this unfunded accumulated benefit obligation plus the existing prepaid asset was the primary cause of a 292 million netoftax charge to shareholders’ equity for 2002 this charge did not impact 2002 earnings 

  

total net periodic pension benefits cost was 126 million in 2002 106 million in 2001 and 29 million in 2000 total net periodic pension benefits cost is expected to be approximately 17 million in 2003 the expected increase in net periodic pension cost in 2003 from 2000 is primarily due to a decrease in asset returns and a decrease in the discount rate the net periodic pension benefit cost for 2003 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 625 percent and an expected return on plan assets of 85 percent 

  

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets will affect the amount of net periodic pension cost ultimately recognized for purposes of determining the expected return on assets component of net periodic pension cost the marketrelated value of assets is calculated by amortizing over a fiveyear period any differences between actual and expected return on assets other differences between assumed and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses unrecognized gains and losses in excess of sfas no 87 employers’ accounting for pensions  minimum threshold requirements are amortized over a ten to fifteen year period 

  

pension contributions in 2002 totaled 189 million including 153 million of contributions to domestic defined benefit plans the 153 million contribution exceeded the minimum funding requirement our 2003 pension contributions are expected to be in the range of 20 million to 25 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

market risk 

we are exposed to various market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates we use derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of some of these risks we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities used to fund operations interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk the table below summarizes our floating and fixed rate debt obligations including the impact of interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2002 the average variable rates depicted below for the interest rate swaps are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at december 31 2002
