many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise commercial service provider and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers 

commercial 

the commercial market represents larger or midmarket and small businesses we sell to our midmarket customers through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses require information technologies and communications products that are easy to configure install and maintain we sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners 

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide the service provider market includes regional national and international wireline carriers webscale operators as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also include media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks whose requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

public sector 

the public sector market includes federal state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector customers have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector customers through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors channel partners as well as through direct sales 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2022 our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 26000 employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from twotier distributors is recognized based on a sellin method these distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices receive certain rebates and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our sales channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain 

geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “cyber attacks data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business and cyber attacks or data breaches on our customers’ or thirdparty providers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided to by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us give rise to legal andor regulatory action damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and software maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as “build buy partner invest and codevelop” this fiveprong approach to how we innovate can be summarized as follows 



acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to generate revenue no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and accelerate new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies with which we have added or expanded strategic alliances during fiscal 2022 and in recent years include apple inc equinix inc google llc international 

business machines corporation microsoft corporation samsung electronics co ltd and amazon web services llc among others 

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services designed to transport and help secure data voice and video traffic across cloud private and public networks and the internet these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas and in key priority and growth areas as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors in each case relative to only some of our products or services include amazon web services llc arista networks inc broadcom inc check point software technologies ltd ciena corporation crowdstrike holdings inc datadog inc dell technologies inc dynatrace inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard enterprise company huawei technologies co ltd juniper networks inc microsoft corporation new relic inc nokia corporation palo alto networks inc ringcentral inc ubiquiti inc vmware inc zoom video communications inc and zscaler inc among others 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits asics offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services product performance price the ability to introduce new products including providing continuous new customer value and products with priceperformance advantages the ability to reduce production costs the ability to provide valueadded features such as security reliability and investment protection conformance to standards market presence the ability to provide financing and disruptive technology shifts and new business models 

we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

research and development 

we regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of secure agile networks internet for the future collaboration endtoend security optimized application experiences and other product technologies our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part on our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internet networking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and strategic investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software in electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process also uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization 9001 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses” 

government regulation 

we are subject to numerous regulations and laws in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business many of these regulations and laws are evolving and their applicability and scope as interpreted by courts and regulators remain uncertain these regulations and laws involve a variety of matters including privacy data protection and personal information tax trade encryption technology environmental sustainability including climate change human rights product certification and national security 

a failure or alleged failure by us to comply with regulations or laws could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information about government regulation and laws applicable to our business see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “our business operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services” and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements subsection f “legal proceedings”

with respect to social justice cisco has been partnering across the globe to multiply our positive impact throughout our communities we have published our social justice beliefs  actions which is our blueprint for how we respond to injustice and address inequity for any community this work is part of a plan for cisco to drive transformational generational impact for vulnerable communities our inclusive future action office helps drive progress and excellence in our strategic actions in this area which are designed to address the broader ecosystem including our employees partners customers and suppliers 

our inclusive future action office is focused on driving impacts through our strategic actions in the african americanblack community and these actions will be the blueprint for how we help address inequity in communities around the world in the future we are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of diversity inclusive of gender generation race ethnicity orientation ability nationality and background — the foundation of our conscious culture 

compensation and benefits 

our total compensation philosophy is designed to attract reward and retain talent it provides market competitive performancebased compensation aligned with each employee’s contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers partners and stockholders we reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation collaboration profitability and growth within our geographies product lines and functions 

cisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably we are a founding signer of the white house equal pay pledge and the parityorg pledge and we are leading the charge to make fair pay a reality for all employees through the employers for pay equity consortium we have also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system for example by using these powerful analytics we are able to test for pay parity on a regular basis and when gaps are found we strive to correct them 

health  wellbeing 

we have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health safety and wellbeing of our employees we provide our employees and their families highquality flexible and convenient benefits and resources for their physical mental and financial wellbeing since the start of the covid19 pandemic employees have continually had to focus on how to balance careers and personal lives all while managing their own physical emotional and financial health we developed a covid19 response and recovery strategy with a focus on both physical and mental health recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health in fiscal 2022 we continued to offer employees “a day for me” which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest we have moved towards a hybrid work model in certain countries giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or at onsite cisco locations 

employee development 

we believe in openended selfdirected learning understanding that each individual knows what skills and resources they need to succeed we encourage employees to explore assignments outside of their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their strengths and improve the way we all work employees choose their own career paths and we support that choice by providing them with tools and resources to help them achieve their career goals 

employee engagement 

we believe that strong communication is key in our conscious culture this communication includes regular virtual all hands which we refer to as a “cisco checkin” and weekly team leader checkins which we refer to as a “team space checkin” our regular virtual cisco checkins were initially launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the covid19 pandemic the cisco checkins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees from business updates to social justice to physical and mental health 

in fiscal 2022 we have seen high level of employee engagement for example there were approximately 21 million team space checkins by our employees in fiscal 2022 reflecting 87 of employees submitting team space checkins employees also participate in our global engagement pulse survey and the real deal survey these surveys allow our employees to provide confidential feedback on our culture company strategy and trust in their direct leaders

 item 1a risk factors tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

risks related to our business and industry 

our business results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020 the covid19 pandemic impacted our financial results and business operations we continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industrywide due to component shortages which have resulted in extended lead times and higher supply chain costs the magnitude and duration of the disruption its continuing impact on us and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain 

the covid19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition shelterinplace andor lockdown orders globally and other measures have and could in the future impact our supply chain in addition current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures can also impact our ability to meet customer demand and could materially adversely affect us our customers have also experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in their operations which can result in delayed reduced or canceled orders and increased collection risks and which may adversely affect our results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future the inputs into certain of our judgments assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the covid19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates as the covid19 pandemic continues to develop many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control including without limitation the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the efficacy of available vaccines the imposition of protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy potential negative impacts of these external factors include but are not limited to material adverse effects on demand for our products and services our supply chain and sales and distribution channels collectability of customer accounts our ability to execute strategic plans impairments and our profitability and cost structure to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include 

• fluctuations in demand for our products and services especially with respect to service providers and internet businesses in part due to changes in the global economic environment 

• changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue 

• our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments 

• price and product competition in the communications and networking industries which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions 

• the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers 

• the introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products and our success in new and evolving markets and in emerging technologies as well as the adoption of new standards 

• the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time 

• variations in sales channels product costs mix of products sold or mix of direct sales and indirect sales 

• the timing size and mix of orders from customers 

• manufacturing and customer lead times 

• fluctuations in our gross margins and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations 

• the ability of our customers channel partners contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer channel partner contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems 

• actual events circumstances outcomes and amounts differing from judgments assumptions and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets including the amounts of related valuation allowances liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

• how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges 

• our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions 

• benefits anticipated from our investments 

• changes in tax laws or accounting rules or interpretations thereof 

as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions including rising inflation or other changes worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on itrelated capital spending by our customers particularly service providers and other customer markets as well increased price competition for our products not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products risk of excess and obsolete inventories risk of supply constraints risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense 

the global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent and is being significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic in certain prior periods we have seen a broadbased weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which has impacted and could impact in the future certain of our markets additionally instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the ongoing russia and ukraine war and chinataiwan relations the current economic challenges in china including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment in addition reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect customers’ perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states trust and confidence in us as an it supplier are critical to the development and growth of our markets impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment including as a result of the russia and ukraine war the significant impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related market uncertainty our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods as it did in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 on a yearoveryear basis or decline as it did in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and certain prior periods our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can 

increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past have caused and in the future could cause some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product or to also place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue further our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments in recent periods we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the significant supply constraints seen industrywide due to component shortages caused in part by the covid19 pandemic these increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charges in future periods if the demand for our products is less than our expectations we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results for additional information and a further discussion of current impacts and risks related to our significant supply constraints inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see results of operations—product gross margin—supply constraints impacts and risks liquidity and capital resources—inventory supply chain and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets such as the semiconductor market in each case could either limit supply or increase costs 

a reduction or interruption in supply including disruptions on our global supply chain caused in part by public health emergencies including the covid19 pandemic geopolitical tensions including as a result of chinataiwan relations or a significant natural disaster including as a result of climate change a significant increase in the price of one or more components including as a result of inflation a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease in addition vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business regulatory or political reasons andor demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations including longer than normal lead times there is currently a market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply which has affected and could further affect lead times the cost 

of that supply and our ability to meet customer demand for our products if we cannot secure sufficient supply in a timely manner we continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industrywide due to component shortages including significant constraints with certain critical components which prevents us from completing manufacturing of certain of our products for example we saw an additional unanticipated supply challenge with covid19 related lockdowns in certain parts of china in the second half of fiscal 2022 that resulted in a severe shortage of certain critical components while we did see some easing of the industrywide supply constraints towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we expect such constraints to continue and the duration of which is uncertain additionally we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or the reramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed 

our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future new markets in which we participate may grow quickly which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity as we acquire companies and new technologies we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners and we face competition for certain components that are supplyconstrained from existing competitors and companies in other markets 

manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments in recent periods we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the significant supply constraints seen industrywide due to component shortages caused in part by the covid19 pandemic these increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charges in future periods if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information and a further discussion of current impacts and risks related to our significant supply constraints inventory commitments and our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see results of operations—product gross margin—supply constraints impacts and risks liquidity and capital resources—inventory supply chain and note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2022 and have declined in certain prior periods on a yearoveryear basis and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors including 

• changes in customer geographic or product mix including mix of configurations within each product group 

• introduction of new products including products with priceperformance advantages and new business models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings 

• our ability to reduce production costs 

• entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets including markets with different pricing and cost structures through acquisitions or internal development 

• sales discounts 

• increases in material labor or other manufacturingrelated costs ie component costs broker fees expedited freight and overtime or higher supply chain logistics costs any of which could be significant especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs such as those currently impacting the market for components including semiconductors and memory and which costs have in the past and may continue to be exacerbated by inflation 

• excess inventory inventory holding charges and obsolescence charges 

• changes in shipment volume 

• the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals 

• increased costs including those caused by tariffs or economic conditions including inflation loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates 

• lower than expected benefits from value engineering 

• increased price competition including competitors from asia especially from china 

• changes in distribution channels 

• increased warranty or royalty costs 

• increased amortization of purchased intangible assets especially from acquisitions 

• how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans 

changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other secure agile networks and collaboration products in addition to longer sales cycles service provider product orders decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and in certain prior periods and at various times in the past including in recent quarters we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and as has been the case in the past such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic political or regulatory uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network 

equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following competition with some of our channel partners including through our direct sales which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas and in key priority and growth areas for example as products related to network programmability such as software defined networking sdn products become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware referred to as “white box” hardware to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 business of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors asics offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services product performance price the ability to introduce new products including providing continuous new customer value and products with priceperformance advantages the ability to reduce production costs the ability to provide valueadded features such as security reliability and investment protection conformance to standards market presence the ability to provide financing and disruptive technology shifts and new business models 

we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from joint ventures if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

we depend upon the development of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product and service introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products if customers do not purchase andor renew our offerings our business could be harmed the covid19 pandemic may also result in longterm changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors along with itrelated capital spending reductions or shifts in spending focus that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs 

the process of developing new technology including more programmable flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions— such as security digital transformation and iot and cloud— is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such as for example networking products based on “white box” hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in a timely fashion offerings to address other transitions or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings we have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual 

products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology including changes in our business models with customers if our strategy for addressing our customer needs or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed 

furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market the success of new products and services depends on several factors including proper new product and service definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products and services differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products and services there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products services and technologies developed by others will not render our products services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction or restructuring costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which included a voluntary early retirement program which was completed in fiscal 2022 our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service and marketing activities and in key priority and growth areas and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas such as endtoend security and internet for the future and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in secure agile networks and in services we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

• difficulties in integrating the operations systems technologies products and personnel of the acquired companies particularly companies with large and widespread operations andor complex products 

• diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions 

• potential difficulties in completing projects associated with inprocess research and development intangibles 

• difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 

• initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners 

• insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 

• the potential loss of key employees customers distributors vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans 

acquisitions may also cause us to 

• issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership 

• use a substantial portion of our cash resources or incur debt 

• significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition 

• assume liabilities 

• record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges 

• incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets 

• incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure 

• incur large writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses 

• become subject to intellectual property or other litigation 

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities further entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence for example as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there is a continuing trend toward industry consolidation in our markets we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries we also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in certain prior periods we continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including the following impacts from global central bank monetary policy issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries that can affect regulatory matters affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states or affect our ability to procure components if a government body were to deny us access to those components governmentrelated disruptions or shutdowns the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment foreign currency exchange rates geopolitical tensions including chinataiwan relations political or social unrest economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region including economic challenges in china and global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties environmental protection regulations including new laws and regulations related to climate change trade protection measures such as tariffs and other legal and regulatory requirements some of which may affect our ability to import our products to export our products from or sell our products in various countries or affect our ability to procure components political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns health or similar issues including pandemics or epidemics such as the covid19 pandemic which could continue to affect customer purchasing decisions difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations 

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty there can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing 

arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our portfolio includes availableforsale debt investments and equity investments the values of which are subject to market price volatility if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies for information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates including emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for such personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business additionally there are existing claims and lawsuits in russia and the potential for future claims and lawsuits in russia andor belarus related to the russia and ukraine war and related trade restrictions and sanctions in the event of an unfavorable resolution of any of these lawsuits the potential outcome could include the seizure of our assets in russia andor belarus which collectively represents less than 01 of our total assets at the end of fiscal 2022 litigation can be costly lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements subsection f “legal proceedings” 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have 

otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to foreignderived intangible income global intangible lowtax income and base erosion and antiabuse tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 38 countries including the united states has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events including as a result of global climate change 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our customers suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding or other weatherrelated activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products in addition global climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms sealevel rise and flooding we have not to date experienced a material event to these matters however the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

terrorism war and other events may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto or any other current or future acts of terrorism war such as the ongoing russia and ukraine war and other events such as economic sanctions and trade restrictions including those related to the ongoing russia and ukraine war may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or could otherwise negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy transportation or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected see “part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—overview—russia and ukraine war” for a discussion of the impact on cisco’s business of the ongoing russia and ukraine war 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

as of the end of fiscal 2022 we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 90 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2023 through 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 100 billion and we had 06 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 30 2022  there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both 

our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances 

our reputation andor business could be negatively impacted by esg matters andor our reporting of such matters 

there is an increasing focus from regulators certain investors and other stakeholders concerning environmental social and governance “esg” matters both in the united states and internationally we communicate certain esgrelated initiatives goals andor commitments regarding environmental matters diversity responsible sourcing and social investments and other matters in our annual purpose report on our website in our filings with the sec and elsewhere these initiatives goals or commitments could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement for example in september 2021 we announced our commitment to achieve net zero across all scopes of greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 the achievement of which relies in large part on the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions around the enhanced power efficiency of our products the adoption of renewable energy at customer sites and the adoption of certain of our products and services by our customers we could fail to achieve or be perceived to fail to achieve our 2040 net zero commitment or other esgrelated initiatives goals or commitments in addition we could be criticized for the timing scope or nature of these initiatives goals or commitments or for any revisions to them to the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about esg matters increase we could be criticized for the accuracy adequacy or completeness of such disclosures our actual or perceived failure to achieve our esgrelated initiatives goals or commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations see note 14e to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the 

past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

risks related to cybersecurity privacy and regulatory requirements 

cyber attacks data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business and cyber attacks or data breaches on our customers’ or thirdparty providers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided to by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us give rise to legal andor regulatory action damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

we experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our products services and it environment on a regular basis and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempts as cyber attacks become increasingly sophisticated and more difficult to predict and protect against despite our implementation of security measures i our products and services and ii the servers data centers and cloudbased solutions on which our and thirdparty data is stored or processed including servers data centers and cloudbased solutions operated by third parties on which we rely collectively our “it environment” are vulnerable to cyber attacks data breaches malware inadvertent error disruptions from unauthorized access tampering or other theft or misuse including by employees contingent workers malicious actors or nationstates or their agents which cyber attack or related activity may intensify during periods of diplomatic or armed conflict such as the russia and ukraine war such events have caused and in the future could result in compromise to or the disruption of access to the operation of our products services and it environment or those of our customers or thirdparty providers we rely on or result in confidential information stored on our systems our customers’ systems or other thirdparty systems being improperly accessed processed disclosed not or in the future or be lost or stolen for example in december 2021 multiple vulnerabilities were reported for the widely used java logging library apache log4j we reviewed the use of this library within our products and services its use in our enterprise it environment and its use by our thirdparty providers and have taken steps to mitigate these vulnerabilities including by providing security updates for affected products to our customers we have not to date experienced a material event related to a cybersecurity matter however the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject us to liability to our customers data subjects suppliers business partners employees and others give rise to legal andor regulatory action could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts are costly to implement and may not be successful breaches of security in our customers’ or thirdparty providers’ networks in thirdparty products we use or in cloudbased services provided to by or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services or a failure to maintain the digital security infrastructure or security tools that protect the integrity of our products services and it environment could in each case result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of thirdparty providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

the products and services we sell to customers and our cloudbased solutions inevitably contain vulnerabilities or security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security we also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes customers may also need to test security updates before they can be deployed which can delay implementation when customers do not deploy security updates in a timely manner or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products services or cloudbased solutions containing the security update they may be left vulnerable in addition we rely on thirdparty providers of software and cloudbased services on which our and thirdparty data is stored or processed and we cannot control the timing at which thirdparty providers remedy vulnerabilities which could leave us vulnerable vulnerabilities and security defects prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of thirdparty providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or 

customers not deploying security updates in a timely manner or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of business 

global privacy and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving extensive and complex compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly in addition evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection processing or crossborder transmission of data including for regulation of cloudbased services could materially affect our customers’ ability to use and our ability to sell our products and services the interpretation and application of these laws in some instances is uncertain and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes for example the european union’s “eu” general data protection regulation “gdpr” applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to products and services offered in the eu and imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data additionally we are subject to california’s consumer privacy act and other laws regulations and obligations that relate to the handling of personal data our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations relating to personal data or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing could subject us to liability to our customers data subjects suppliers business partners employees and others give rise to legal andor regulatory action could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our business operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services 

changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate in the united states and in other countries could materially affect the sales of our products and services in particular economic sanctions and changes to export control requirements have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to sell and support our products and services in certain jurisdictions in addition changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our service provider customers’ purchase of our products and services and they could also impact sales of our own regulated offerings additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our products and services include laws and regulations related to encryption technology environmental sustainability including climate change human rights product certification and national security controls applicable to our supply chain for example new laws and regulations in response to climate change could result in increased energy efficiency requirements for our products and increased compliance and energy costs changes in regulatory requirements in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 

in fiscal 2022 we delivered growth in total revenue and strong profitability in a challenging environment impacted by significant supply constraints rising component and related costs and the russia and ukraine war we remain focused on delivering innovation across our technologies to assist our customers in executing on their digital transformations we continue to be negatively impacted by supply constraints seen industrywide due to component shortages while we did see some easing of the supply constraints towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we expect the constraints to continue and the duration is uncertain we have and continue to take multiple steps in order to mitigate the component shortages and deliver products to our customers we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities we continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment while the overall environment remains uncertain we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term 

total revenue increased by 3 compared with fiscal 2021 within total revenue product revenue increased by 6 and service revenue decreased by 2 fiscal 2022 had 52 weeks compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2021 thus our results for fiscal 2022 reflect one less week compared with fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2022 total software revenue was flat at 151 billion across all product areas and service within total software revenue subscription revenue increased 3 total gross margin decreased by 15 percentage points product gross margin decreased by 21 percentage points largely driven by increased costs related to supply constraints and to a lesser extent product mix partially offset by favorable pricing as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 13 percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 13 percentage points diluted earnings per share increased 13 driven by an increase of 12 in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 44 million shares 

in terms of our geographic segments revenue from the americas increased by 07 billion emea revenue increased by 08 billion and revenue in our apjc segment increased by 03 billion 

from a customer market standpoint we experienced product revenue growth in the commercial enterprise and service provider markets partially offset by a decline in the public sector market 

from a product category perspective total product revenue increased 6 year over year driven by growth in revenue in secure agile networks of 5 internet for the future of 17 endtoend security of 9 and optimized application experiences of 11 partially offset by a product revenue decline in collaboration of 5 

russia and ukraine war 

in march 2022 in connection with the russian invasion of ukraine cisco announced its intention to stop business operations in russia and belarus for the foreseeable future those operations in russia and belarus included sales services and related support functions further on june 23 2022 we announced that we will begin an orderly winddown and exit of our business in russia and belarus 

our business operations in russia belarus and ukraine collectively comprised approximately 1 of our total revenue for the year ended july 31 2021 russia and belarus collectively represented less than 01 of our total assets at the end of fiscal 2022 as a result of the war and the resulting events we have not recognized revenue in these countries effective march 2022 the negative impact to total revenue was approximately 200 million for fiscal 2022 which includes committed revenue we would have otherwise recognized charges for uncollectible receivables and other items further we also assessed the risk to the recoverability of our assets and other potential financial exposures in these countries we have reserved for the nonrecoverability of substantially all of our assets in russia and belarus as a result we have recognized certain nonrecurring charges of 91 million in cost of sales and operating expenses in fiscal 2022 related to nonrecoverability of certain assets special personnelrelated charges in order to support impacted employees and severance and other exit related costs 

the ongoing effect of the russia and ukraine war are difficult to predict due to the other uncertainties identified in part i item 1a risk factors herein 

fourth quarter snapshot 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 total revenue product revenue and service revenue were each flat as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 with regard to our geographic segment performance on a yearoveryear basis revenue in emea increased by 8 offset by declines in americas and apjc by 3 and 2 respectively from a product category perspective we experienced product revenue growth in collaboration endtoend security and optimized application experiences partially offset by declines in secure agile networks and internet for the future total gross margin decreased by 23 percentage points driven by higher component and commodity costs in addition to higher freight and logistics costs related to supply constraints partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 12 percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 10 percentage points diluted earnings per share decreased by 4 driven by a decrease in net income of 6 and a decrease in diluted share count of 101 million shares

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021 in millions 



critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

the inputs into certain of our judgments assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the covid19 pandemic including the associated impact of supply constraints on our critical and significant accounting estimates the covid19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2022 these estimates include goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes among other items the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates as the covid19 pandemic continues many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods 

revenue recognition 

we enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations as a result our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations we determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software licenses and saas as distinct performance obligations term software licenses represent multiple obligations which include software licenses and software maintenance in transactions where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis 

we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product generally upon shipment electronic delivery or when the software is available for download by the customer or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided saas arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services on our product sales we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales we record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes 

revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices ssp ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers in instances where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs 

we assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price we apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors channel partners and customers when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these programs applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available we also consider the customers’ right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory 

our provision for inventory was 102 million 116 million and 74 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 227 million 76 million and 139 million in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements or if supply constraints were to continue we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments we continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industrywide due to component shortages caused in part by the covid19 pandemic for further discussion around the supply constraints impacts and risks see “—results of operations—gross margin—supply constraints impacts and risks” and “—liquidity and capital resources—inventory supply chain” 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2022 the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 647 billion for the americas 552 billion for emea and 210 billion for apjc 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and 

then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were 15 million for fiscal 2022 our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits foreignderived intangible income deductions global intangible lowtaxed income tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation and international realignments our effective tax rate was 184 201 and 197 in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to foreignderived intangible income deduction global intangible lowtax income and base erosion and antiabuse tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the oecd an international association comprised of 38 countries including the united states has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

results of operations 

a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 is presented below a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 with the exception of product revenue by category for which is discussed herein can be found under item 7 in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended july 31 2021 filed with the sec on september 9 2021 

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

total revenue in fiscal 2022 increased by 3 compared with fiscal 2021 product revenue increased by 6 and service revenue decreased by 2 our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including the it spending environment and the level of spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment

amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

service revenue decreased 2 driven by declines in our maintenance business advisory services and software support offerings partially offset by growth in our solution support and network support offerings the extra week in fiscal 2021 also contributed to the decrease in service revenue in fiscal 2022 service revenue decreased in the americas and apjc segments partially offset by growth in the emea segment 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 



product gross margin 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 



1 productivity includes overall manufacturingrelated costs such as component costs warranty expense provision for inventory freight logistics shipment volume and other items not categorized elsewhere 

product gross margin decreased by 21 percentage points primarily driven by negative impacts from productivity largely driven by increased costs related to supply constraints from freight expedites and higher component and commodity costs these impacts were partially offset by favorable pricing the benefit we saw from favorable pricing was primarily driven by price increases implemented during fiscal 2022 to partially offset increases in components and commodity costs freight and logistics costs driven by supply constraints 

supply constraints impacts and risks 

we continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industrywide due to component shortages caused in part by the covid19 pandemic and for which the duration of such constraints is uncertain these shortages have resulted in increased costs ie component and other commodity costs freight expedite fees etc which have had a negative impact on our product gross margin and have resulted in extended lead times for us and our customers we have taken a number of steps in order to mitigate the supply constraint related impacts including partnering with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing ability and extending supply coverage including in certain cases revising supplier arrangements paying significantly higher component and logistics costs to secure supply modifying our product designs in order to leverage alternate suppliers where possible and continually optimizing our inventory build and customer delivery plans among others we believe these actions are helping us to optimize our access to critical components and meet customer demand for our products we continue to see solid demand across the majority of our portfolio as a result in order to secure supply to meet customer demand we have increased our inventory balances inventory purchase commitments and inventory deposits and prepayments see “—liquidity and capital resources—inventory supply chain” which in turn has increased our supply chain exposure additionally in certain situations we have prepaid or made deposits with suppliers to secure future supply these actions significantly increase the risk of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses if customer demand were to suddenly and significantly decrease in future periods while we believe we are taking the right strategic and operational actions to address the supply situation we recognize the increased risks 

service gross margin 

our service gross margin percentage increased by 03 percentage points primarily due to lower headcountrelated and delivery costs and favorable mix of service offerings partially offset by lower sales volume 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service 

business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



1 the unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense significant litigation settlements and other contingencies charges related to asset impairments and restructurings and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

we experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our americas segment due to negative impacts from productivity and unfavorable product mix partially offset by favorable pricing 

gross margin in our emea segment was flat due to higher service gross margin favorable product mix and favorable pricing offset by negative impacts from productivity 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage increase was due to favorable product mix and favorable pricing partially offset by negative impacts from productivity 

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment 

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



our fiscal 2022 had one less week compared with fiscal 2021 which had an extra week 

rd expenses 

rd expenses increased due to higher headcountrelated expenses higher sharebased compensation expense higher acquisitionrelated costs and higher contracted services spending partially offset by lower discretionary spending 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower headcountrelated expenses and lower contracted services spending partially offset by higher discretionary spending certain nonrecurring charges recognized due to the russia and ukraine war and higher sharebased compensation expense the extra week in fiscal 2021 contributed to the decrease in headcountrelated expenses 

ga expenses 

ga expenses decreased due to lower contracted services spending partially offset by certain nonrecurring charges recognized due to the russia and ukraine war 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2022 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 154 million or 09 compared with fiscal 2021 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets including impairment charges in millions 



the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions and impairment charges of 15 million the impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value resulting from reductions in or the elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of our technology and inprocess research and development iprd intangible assets 

restructuring and other charges 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges in millions 

we initiated a restructuring plan in fiscal 2021 which included a voluntary early retirement program in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas the total pretax charges were estimated to be approximately 900 million we incurred cumulative charges of 892 million and completed this plan in fiscal 2022 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

operating income increased by 9 and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 13 percentage points these changes resulted primarily from a revenue increase and lower restructuring and other charges partially offset by a gross margin percentage decrease driven by negative impacts from productivity partially offset by favorable pricing 

interest and other income loss net 

interest income expense net the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



interest income decreased driven by lower average book yields and lower average balances of cash and availableforsale debt investments the decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance 

other income loss net the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 



the increase in our other income loss net was primarily driven by higher realized and unrealized gains on our privately held investments and to a lesser extent favorable impacts from foreign exchange the increase was partially offset by changes in net gains losses on availableforsale debt investments and marketable equity investments 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 184 for fiscal 2022 compared with 201 for fiscal 2021 the net 17 percentage points decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in prior year discrete tax expenses and state taxes 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by cash returned to stockholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of 77 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of 62 billion net decrease in debt of 25 billion changes in unrealized losses of our investments and other of 09 billion net increase in restricted cash equivalents of 08 billion capital expenditures of 05 billion and net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of 04 billion these uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 132 billion and issuance of commercial paper of 06 billion 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our availableforsale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

securities lending we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale debt investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses we did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented as of july 30 2022 and july 31 2021 we had no outstanding securities lending transactions 

free cash flow and capital allocation as part of our capital allocation strategy we target to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we 

further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other required uses of cash including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



on august 23 2022 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 038 per common share to be paid on october 26 2022 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on october 5 2022 any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors 

the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately 152 billion with no termination date 

accounts receivable net   the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions 



our accounts receivable net as of july 30 2022 increased by approximately 15 compared with the end of fiscal 2021 primarily due to timing and amount of product and service billings at the end of fiscal 2022 compared with the end of fiscal 2021 

inventory supply chain the following table summarizes our inventories and inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions 



the following table summarizes our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers by period in millions 



inventory as of july 30 2022 increased by 65 and 100 from our inventory balances at the end of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 26 and 194 from our balances at the end of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively we increased our balances in inventories inventory purchase commitments and inventory deposits and prepayments as compared to prior fiscal years in order to address significant supply constraints seen industrywide the increases were primarily due to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components and commitments with contract manufacturers to meet customer demand and to address extended 

lead times as well as advance payments with suppliers to secure future supply as a result of the supply constraints we have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage including revising supplier arrangements as discussed our risks of future material excess and obsolete inventory and related losses are further outlined in the result of operations—product gross margin section 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity 

our inventory purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of supply constraints rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and inventory purchase commitments is appropriate for our current and expected customer demand and revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees the following table summarizes our financing receivables in millions 



financing receivables our financing arrangements include leases loans and financed service contracts lease receivables include salestype leases arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we also provide financing to certain qualified customers for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services the majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed financing receivables decreased by 15 

financing guarantees in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms 

the volume of channel partner financing was 279 billion 267 billion and 269 billion in fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was 14 billion and 13 billion as of july 30 2022 and july 31 2021 respectively we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed as of july 30 2022 the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately 179 million of which approximately 9 million was recorded as deferred revenue 

borrowings 

senior notes the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 



interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 30 2022 

commercial paper we have a shortterm debt financing program in which up to 100 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes we had 06 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 30 2022 and no commercial paper outstanding as of july 31 2021 

credit facility on may 13 2021 we entered into a 5year credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on may 13 2026 as of july 30 2022 we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit agreement any advances under the 5year credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either a with respect to loans in us dollars i libor or ii the base rate to be defined as the highest of x the bank of america prime rate y the federal funds rate plus 050 and z a daily rate equal to onemonth libor plus 10 b with respect to loans in euros euribor c with respect to loans in yen tibor and d with respect to loans in pounds sterling sonia plus a credit spread adjustment plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc provided that in no event will the interest rate be less than 00 we will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings in addition the 5year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainabilitylinked metrics specifically our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve or fail to achieve certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics i social impact and ii foam reduction we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion and at our option extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 

remaining performance obligations the following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations in millions 



total remaining performance obligations increased 2 in fiscal 2022 remaining performance obligations for product increased 6 and remaining product obligations for service decreased 1 compared to fiscal 2021 we expect approximately 54 of total remaining performance obligations to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months 

deferred revenue the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



total deferred revenue increased 5 in fiscal 2022 the increase in deferred product revenue of 11 was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings the slight increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue 

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 30 2022 in millions 



operating leases for more information on our operating leases see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products our inventory purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” 

other purchase obligations other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

transition tax payable transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the onetime us transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act “the tax act” 

other longterm liabilities other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 23 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 55 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our acquisitions we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones or are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 04 billion and 02 billion as of july 30 2022 and july 31 2021 respectively 

in the ordinary course of business we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 30 2022 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

while the covid19 pandemic and the russia and ukraine war have not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets these events and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs including inventory and other supply related payments capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt pending acquisitions future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations we expect increased payments related to inventory and other supply related payments through at least the next 12 months there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with 

unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

availableforsale debt investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding availableforsale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our availableforsale debt investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our availableforsale debt investments as of july 30 2022 our availableforsale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading our availableforsale debt investments are not leveraged as of july 30 2022 we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our availableforsale debt investments including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points bps plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of july 30 2022 and july 31 2021 are as follows in millions 





financing receivables as of july 30 2022 our financing receivables had a carrying value of 79 billion compared with 93 billion as of july 31 2021 as of july 30 2022 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt as of july 30 2022 we had 90 billion in principal amount of senior fixedrate notes outstanding the carrying amount of the senior notes was 89 billion and the related fair value based on market prices was 97 billion as of july 30 2022 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 15 billion of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 03 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt that is not hedged 

equity price risk 

marketable equity investments the fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility we hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading the total fair value of our marketable equity securities was 241 million and 137 million as of july 30 2022 and july 31 2021 respectively 

privately held investments these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of july 30 2022 the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held investments was 19 billion compared with 15 billion at july 31 2021 some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of privately held investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 



we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2022 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 154 million or 09 as compared with fiscal 2021 to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes

reimagine applications 

in our view over the next several years customers will be increasingly writing modern software applications that can run on any hybrid cloud and will be adding billions of connections to their environments customers will need to be able to build 

table of contents 

applications quickly deploy them nearly anywhere monitor experiences and act in real time

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer accounted for 10 or more of revenue our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise commercial service provider and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers 

commercial 

within the commercial market we define large businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1000 employees we sell to the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or organizations with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communications products that are easy to configure install and maintain we sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners 

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide the service provider market includes regional national and international wireline carriers webscale operators as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also include media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks whose requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

public sector 

the public sector market includes federal state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector customers have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector customers through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors channel partners as well as through direct sales 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2021 our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 25000 employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in approximately 90 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from twotier distributors is recognized based on a sellin method these distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices receive certain rebates and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our sales channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

table of contents 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “cyberattacks data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business and cyberattacks or data breaches on our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and software maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as “build buy partner invest and codevelop” this fiveprong approach to how we innovate can be summarized as follows 



acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to generate revenue no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

table of contents 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and accelerate new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies with which we have added or expanded strategic alliances during fiscal 2021 and in recent years include apple inc equinix inc google llc international business machines corporation microsoft corporation samsung electronics co ltd and amazon web services llc among others 

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services designed to transport and help secure data voice and video traffic across cloud private and public networks and the internet these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas and in key priority and growth areas as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors in each case relative to only some of our products or services include amazon web services llc arista networks inc broadcom inc commscope holding company inc check point software technologies ltd crowdstrike holdings inc dell technologies inc dynatrace inc f5 networks inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard enterprise company huawei technologies co ltd juniper networks inc lenovo group limited logmein inc microsoft corporation new relic inc nokia corporation nutanix inc palo alto networks inc ringcentral inc ubiquiti inc vmware inc zoom video communications inc and zscaler inc among others 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits asics offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services product performance price the ability to introduce new products including providing continuous new customer value and products with priceperformance advantages the ability to reduce production costs the ability to provide valueadded features such as security reliability and investment protection conformance to standards market presence the ability to provide financing and disruptive technology shifts and new business models 

we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success

research and development 

we regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of infrastructure platforms applications security and other product technologies our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of increased focus include our networking technologies which encompasses switching routing and wireless technologies within infrastructure platforms conferencing security and analytics products our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part on our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internet networking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and strategic investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software in electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process also uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization 9001 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

table of contents 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses”

table of contents 

mental health in fiscal 2021 we continued to offer employees “a day for me” which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge and rest 

employee development 

we believe in openended selfdirected learning understanding that each individual knows what skills and resources they need to succeed we encourage employees to explore job roles outside of their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their strengths and improve the way we all work employees choose their own path and we support that choice by providing them tools and resources to help them achieve their career goals 

employee engagement 

we believe that strong communication is key in our conscious culture this communication includes regular virtual all hands which we refer to as a “cisco checkin” and weekly team leader checkins which we refer to as a “team space checkin” our regular virtual cisco checkins were initially launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the covid19 pandemic the cisco checkins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees from business updates to social justice to physical and mental health 

in fiscal 2021 we have seen high level of employee engagement for example there were approximately 2 million team space checkins by our employees in fiscal 2021 reflecting 85 of employees submitting team space checkins employees also participate in our global engagement pulse survey and the real deal survey these surveys allow our employees to provide confidential feedback on our culture company strategy and trust in their direct leaders

 item 1a risk factors tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

risks related to our business and industry 

our business results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations in the second half of fiscal 2020 the covid19 pandemic had an impact on our financial results and business operations with a significant impact in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints we continue to address these supply chain challenges and cost impacts which we expect will continue at least through the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of fiscal 2022 the magnitude and duration of the disruption its continuing impact on us and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain these disruptions include the unprecedented actions taken to try to contain the pandemic such as travel bans and restrictions business closures and social distancing measures such as quarantines and shelterinplace orders 

the covid19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition shelterinplace orders and other measures including workfromhome and other policies implemented to protect workers has and could in the future impact our supply chain such disruptions may continue or worsen in the future in addition current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures can also impact our ability to meet customer demand and could materially adversely affect us our customers have also experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in their operations which can result in delayed reduced or canceled orders and increased collection risks and which may adversely affect our results of operations the covid19 pandemic may also result in longterm changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors along with itrelated capital spending reductions or shifts in spending focus that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs 

the recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges for example governmental lockdowns restrictions or new regulations has and could in the future impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work with the same speed and productivity in certain areas even as other areas do not see negative impact the extent andor duration of ongoing workforce 

table of contents 

restrictions and limitations could impact our ability to enhance develop and support existing products and services and hold product sales and marketing events to the extent we were able to previously in addition malefactors are seeking to use the covid19 pandemic to launch new cyberattacks the covid19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future the inputs into certain of our judgments assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the covid19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates as the covid19 pandemic continues to develop many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods 

we are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control including without limitation the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines the imposition of protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy potential negative impacts of these external factors include but are not limited to material adverse effects on demand for our products and services our supply chain and sales and distribution channels collectability of customer accounts our ability to execute strategic plans impairments and our profitability and cost structure to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include 

• fluctuations in demand for our products and services especially with respect to service providers and internet businesses in part due to changes in the global economic environment 

• changes in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers’ spending plans and associated revenue 

• our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels and purchase commitments 

• price and product competition in the communications and networking industries which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business models from various geographic regions 

• the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers 

• the introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products and our success in new and evolving markets and in emerging technologies as well as the adoption of new standards 

• the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings where revenue is recognized over time 

• variations in sales channels product costs mix of products sold or mix of direct sales and indirect sales 

• the timing size and mix of orders from customers 

• manufacturing and customer lead times 

• fluctuations in our gross margins and the factors that contribute to such fluctuations 

• the ability of our customers channel partners contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures especially during a period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer channel partner contract manufacturer or supplier financial problems 

• actual events circumstances outcomes and amounts differing from judgments assumptions and estimates used in determining the values of certain assets including the amounts of related valuation allowances liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

• how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans and the impact of changes in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charges 

• our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions 

• benefits anticipated from our investments 

• changes in tax laws or accounting rules or interpretations thereof

as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on itrelated capital spending by our customers particularly service providers and other customer markets as well increased price competition for our products not only from our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products risk of excess and obsolete inventories risk of supply constraints risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity and higher overhead costs as a percentage of revenue and higher interest expense 

the global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent and is being significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic during fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we continued to see a broadbased weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets we also experienced continuing weakness in emerging countries and we expect ongoing uncertainty in this market additionally instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the united kingdom “brexit” withdrawal from the european union the current economic challenges in china including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment in addition reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect customers’ perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states trust and confidence in us as an it supplier are critical to the development and growth of our markets impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment the significant impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related market uncertainty our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 and in certain prior periods on a yearoveryear basis our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past have caused and in the future could cause some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product or to also place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue further our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results in addition when facing

component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments for example in fiscal 2021 we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the supply chain challenges seen industrywide due to component shortages caused in part by the covid19 pandemic these increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results financial problems of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers by other companies and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets such as the semiconductor market in each case could either limit supply or increase costs 

a reduction or interruption in supply including disruptions on our global supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic or a significant natural disaster including as a result of climate change a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease in addition vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business regulatory or political reasons andor demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations including longer than normal lead times there is currently a market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply which has affected and could further affect lead times the cost of that supply and our ability to meet customer demand for our products if we cannot secure sufficient supply in a timely manner we expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of fiscal 2022 additionally we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or the reramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed 

our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify 

table of contents 

sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future new markets in which we participate may grow quickly which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity as we acquire companies and new technologies we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners and we face competition for certain components that are supplyconstrained from existing competitors and companies in other markets 

manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments for example in fiscal 2021 we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the supply chain challenges seen industrywide due to component shortages caused in part by the covid19 pandemic these increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2021 and have declined in certain prior periods on a yearoveryear basis and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors including 

• changes in customer geographic or product mix including mix of configurations within each product group 

• introduction of new products including products with priceperformance advantages and new business models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings 

• our ability to reduce production costs 

• entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets including markets with different pricing and cost structures through acquisitions or internal development 

• sales discounts 

• increases in material labor or other manufacturingrelated costs ie component costs broker fees expedited freight and overtime or higher supply chain logistics costs any of which could be significant especially during periods of supply constraints for certain costs such as those impacting the market for components including semiconductors and memory 

• excess inventory inventory holding charges and obsolescence charges 

• changes in shipment volume 

• the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals 

• increased cost including those caused by tariffs loss of cost savings or dilution of savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturers or suppliers deteriorates 

• lower than expected benefits from value engineering 

• increased price competition including competitors from asia especially from china 

• changes in distribution channels 

• increased warranty or royalty costs 

• increased amortization of purchased intangible assets especially from acquisitions 

• how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans 

changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other infrastructure platforms and applications products in addition to longer sales cycles service provider product orders decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and in certain prior periods and at various times in the past including in recent quarters we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and as has been the case in the past such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic political or regulatory uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following competition with some of our channel partners including through our direct sales which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or otherwise compete with them some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their customers may ask them to bear some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas and in key priority and growth areas for example as products related to network programmability such as software defined networking sdn products become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware referred to as “white box” hardware to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours in addition the growth in demand for technology

delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 business of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors asics offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcomes the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services product performance price the ability to introduce new products including providing continuous new customer value and products with priceperformance advantages the ability to reduce production costs the ability to provide valueadded features such as security reliability and investment protection conformance to standards market presence the ability to provide financing and disruptive technology shifts and new business models 

we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and in the past have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated 

table of contents 

challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

we depend upon the development of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product and service introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products if customers do not purchase andor renew our offerings our business could be harmed the covid19 pandemic may also result in longterm changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors along with itrelated capital spending reductions or shifts in spending focus that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs 

the process of developing new technology including more programmable flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions— such as security digital transformation and iot and cloud— is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such as for example networking products based on “white box” hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in a timely fashion offerings to address other transitions or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings we have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology including changes in our business models with customers if our strategy for addressing our customer needs or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed 

furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market the success of new products and services depends on several factors including proper new product and service definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products and services differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products and services there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products services and technologies developed by others will not render our products services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction or restructuring costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such 

table of contents 

assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which included a voluntary early retirement program and which has now been substantially completed our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service and marketing activities and in key priority and growth areas and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas such as security and applications and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

• difficulties in integrating the operations systems technologies products and personnel of the acquired companies particularly companies with large and widespread operations andor complex products 

• diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions 

• potential difficulties in completing projects associated with inprocess research and development intangibles 

• difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 

• initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners 

• insufficient revenue to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions 

• the potential loss of key employees customers distributors vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans 

acquisitions may also cause us to 

• issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership 

• use a substantial portion of our cash resources or incur debt 

• significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition 

• assume liabilities 

• record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges 

• incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets 

• incur tax expenses related to the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure 

• incur large writeoffs and restructuring and other related expenses 

• become subject to intellectual property or other litigation

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities further entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence for example as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there is a continuing trend toward industry consolidation in our markets we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries we also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in the first half of fiscal 2021 and in certain prior periods we continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including the following impacts from global central bank monetary policy issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries that can affect regulatory matters affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states or affect our ability to

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty there can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our portfolio includes availableforsale debt investments and equity investments the values of which are subject to market price volatility if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies for information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates including emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel 

table of contents 

could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements subsection f “legal proceedings” 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to foreignderived intangible income global intangible lowtax income and base erosion and antiabuse tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 38 countries including the united states has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events including as a result of global climate change 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products in addition global climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such as drought wildfires storms sealevel rise and flooding a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano flood or a wildfire could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

terrorism and other events may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as loss 

table of contents 

of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy transportation or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

as of the end of fiscal 2021 we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 115 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2021 through 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 100 billion and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 31 2021  there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances 

risks related to intellectual property 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations see note 14e to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the 

table of contents 

past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

risks related to cybersecurity and regulations 

cyberattacks data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business and cyberattacks or data breaches on our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

we experience cyberattacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempts despite our implementation of security measures i our products and services and ii the servers data centers and cloudbased solutions on which our and thirdparty data is stored are vulnerable to cyberattacks data breaches malware and disruptions from unauthorized access tampering or other theft or misuse including by employees malicious actors or inadvertent error such events have and could in the future compromise or disrupt access to or the operation of our products services and networks or those of our customers or result in the information stored on our systems or those of our customers being improperly accessed processed disclosed lost or stolen we have not to date experienced a material event however the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject us to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others give rise to legal andor regulatory action could damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and may not be successful breaches of security in our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of thirdparty providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

the products and services we sell to customers and our cloudbased solutions inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security we also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes customers may also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation in addition we rely on thirdparty providers of software and cloudbased services and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities when customers do not deploy specific releases or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products services or cloudbased solutions containing the release they may be left vulnerable vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of thirdparty providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying specific releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

our business operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by regulatory uncertainty applicable to our products and services 

changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate in the united states and in other countries could materially affect the sales of our products and services in particular changes in telecommunications regulations could impact our service provider customers’ purchase of our products and offers and they could also impact sales of our own regulated offers in addition evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection processing or crossborder transmission of data including regulation of cloudbased services could materially affect our customers’ ability to use and our ability to sell our products and offers additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our products and offers include laws and regulations related to encryption technology environmental sustainability including climate change export control 

table of contents 

product certification and national security controls applicable to our supply chain for example new laws and regulations in response to climate change could result in increased energy efficiency for our products and increased compliance and energy costs changes in regulatory requirements in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

risks related to ownership of our stock 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price

fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 

in fiscal 2021 we delivered growth in revenue in a very challenging environment as customers have accelerated their digitization and cloud investments stemming from the covid19 pandemic we focused on executing and innovating to support and assist that transition in the second half of fiscal 2021 we began to see c ustomers prepare for office reopenings and hybrid work by increasing investments in their technologies total revenue increased by 1 compared with fiscal 2020 our product revenue reflected growth in security partially offset by declines in applications infrastructure platforms was flat we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities we continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment while the overall environment remains uncertain we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term 

within total revenue product revenue was flat and service revenue increased by 4 fiscal 2021 had 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2020 thus our results for fiscal 2021 reflect an extra week compared with fiscal 2020 we estimate that a majority of our revenue increase was attributable to the extra week in fiscal 2021 total software revenue was 150 billion across all product areas and service an increase of 7 within total software revenue subscription revenue increased 15 total gross margin decreased by 03 percentage points product gross margin decreased by 02 percentage points due to lower productivity benefits largely driven by ongoing costs related to supply chain constraints the effect of pricing erosion was moderate we have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage including revising supplier arrangements to address supply chain challenges as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 07 percentage points the total impact associated with the extra week on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately 150 million excluding the impact of sharebased compensation expense operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 18 percentage points we incurred restructuring and other charges of 886 million which resulted in a decrease of 6 in net income and a decrease of 5 in diluted earnings per share 

in terms of our geographic segments revenue from the americas decreased by 01 billion emea revenue increased by 03 billion and revenue in our apjc segment increased by 04 billion the “bricm” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 6 in the aggregate driven by a decrease in product revenue across each of the bricm countries with the exception of india 

from a customer market standpoint we experienced product revenue growth in the public sector and service provider markets partially offset by declines in the enterprise and commercial markets as fiscal 2021 progressed we saw improvement in business momentum in our customer markets which we believe was related to an improving global macroeconomic environment 

from a product category perspective total product revenue was flat year over year driven by growth in revenue in security of 7 offset by a product revenue decline in applications of 1 infrastructure platforms was flat

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 in millions 



table of contents 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

the inputs into certain of our judgments assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the covid19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates the covid19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2021 these estimates include goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes among other items the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates as the covid19 pandemic continues many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods 

revenue recognition 

we enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations as a result our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations we determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software licenses and saas as distinct performance obligations term software licenses represent multiple obligations which include software licenses and software maintenance in transactions where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis 

we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product generally upon shipment electronic delivery or when the software is available for download by the customer or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided saas arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services on our product sales we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales we record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes 

revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices ssp ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers in instances where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs 

we assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price we apply judgment in identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors channel partners and customers when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these programs applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available we also consider the customers right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details 

table of contents 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2021 the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 803 billion for the americas 730 billion for emea and 332 billion for apjc 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits foreignderived intangible income deductions global intangible lowtaxed income tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 201 197 and 202 in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

table of contents 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to foreignderived intangible income deduction global intangible lowtax income and base erosion and antiabuse tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 38 countries including the united states has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

total revenue in fiscal 2021 increased by 1 compared with fiscal 2020 product revenue was flat and service revenue increased by 4 our total revenue reflected growth in emea and apjc americas was flat product revenue for the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced a 6 product revenue decline with decreases in each of these countries with the exception of india 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including the it spending environment and the level of spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment

product revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

americas 

product revenue in the americas segment decreased by 2 the product revenue decrease was driven by declines in the enterprise and commercial markets partially offset by growth in the public sector and service provider markets from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 1 in the united states 18 in mexico and 9 in brazil partially offset by a product revenue increase of 4 in canada 

emea 

the increase in product revenue in the emea segment of 2 was driven by growth in the service provider and public sector markets partially offset by declines in the commercial and enterprise markets product revenue from emerging countries within emea decreased by 7 and product revenue for the remainder of the emea segment which primarily consists of countries in western europe increased by 4 from a country perspective product revenue increased by 4 in germany partially offset by declines in the united kingdom and france by 1 and 2 respectively

table of contents 

product revenue by category 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to product categories and customer markets for various purposes we report our product revenue in the following categories infrastructure platforms applications security and other products 

the following table presents product revenue by category in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation 

infrastructure platforms 

the infrastructure platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching routing wireless and the data center infrastructure platforms revenue was flat compared to fiscal 2020 with growth in routing and wireless offset by declines in switching and data center this was the product area most impacted by the covid19 pandemic environment in the first half of fiscal 2021 switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching although we had strong revenue growth in our catalyst 9000 series meraki switching offerings and nexus 9000 series we experienced an increase in sales of routing products with growth primarily in the service provider market wireless had strong growth driven by our meraki and wifi6 products revenue from data center declined driven by continued market contraction impacting primarily our servers products 

applications 

the applications product category includes our collaboration offerings unified communications cisco telepresence and conferencing as well as iot and appdynamics analytics software offerings revenue in our applications product category decreased by 1 or 64 million with a decline in unified communications and cisco telepresence partially offset by double digit growth in iot software offerings and growth in webex 

security 

revenue in our security product category increased 7 or 224 million revenue from our cloud security portfolio reflected strong doubledigit growth and continued momentum with our duo and umbrella offerings 

table of contents 

service revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

service revenue increased 4 driven by growth in our maintenance business and solution support offerings service revenue increased across all geographic segments service revenue benefited from the extra week in fiscal 2021 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 



product gross margin 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 



1 productivity includes overall manufacturingrelated costs such as component costs warranty expense provision for inventory freight logistics shipment volume and other items not categorized elsewhere 

product gross margin decreased by 02 percentage points driven by pricing erosion partially offset by favorable product mix and lower productivity benefits the effect of pricing erosion was moderate driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments productivity improvements were adversely impacted by ongoing costs related to supply chain constraints the favorable mix was driven by changes in the proportion of products sold from each of our product categories 

during fiscal 2021 we continued to manage through supply chain challenges seen industry wide due to component shortages caused in part by the covid19 pandemic these challenges resulted in increased costs ie component costs broker fees 

table of contents 

expedited freight and overtime which had a negative impact on product gross margin and extended lead times to us and our customers we have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage including revising supplier arrangements to address supply chain challenges we believe these actions will enable us to optimize our access to critical components including semiconductors we expect these supply chain challenges to continue through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of fiscal 2022 

productivity improvements were driven by memory cost savings and other cost reductions including value engineering efforts eg component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations 

service gross margin 

our service gross margin percentage decreased by 03 percentage points primarily due to higher headcountrelated and delivery costs partially offset by higher sales volume and to a lesser extent favorable mix of service offerings 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



1 the unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense significant litigation settlements and other contingencies charges related to asset impairments and restructurings and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

we experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our americas segment due to favorable product mix and productivity improvements partially offset by pricing erosion 

gross margin in our emea segment decreased due to pricing erosion partially offset by productivity improvements and to a lesser extent favorable product mix lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage increase was due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix partially offset by pricing erosion 

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2021 had an extra week compared to fiscal 2020 the extra week in fiscal 2021 contributed to the increase in headcountrelated expenses in our rd sales and marketing and ga expenses 

rd expenses 

rd expenses increased due to higher headcountrelated expenses higher sharebased compensation expense higher acquisitionrelated costs and higher contracted services spending partially offset by lower discretionary spending 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to higher headcountrelated expenses higher contracted services spending and higher sharebased compensation expense partially offset by lower discretionary spending 

ga expenses 

ga expenses increased due to the impact from the gain recognized on the sale of property in fiscal 2020 and higher headcountrelated expenses 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2021 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 214 million or 12 compared with fiscal 2020 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets in millions 



the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions 

table of contents 

restructuring and other charges 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges in millions 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we initiated a restructuring plan which included a voluntary early retirement program in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas the total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately 900 million in connection with this restructuring plan we incurred charges of 881 million during fiscal 2021 we substantially completed the fiscal 2021 plan in fiscal 2021 and do not expect any remaining charges related to this plan to be material we estimate the fiscal 2021 plan will generate cost savings of approximately 10 billion on an annualized basis 

we incurred total restructuring and other charges of 886 million in fiscal 2021 we incurred charges of 881 million related to the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2021 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced during fiscal 2020 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

operating income decreased by 6 and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 18 percentage points these changes resulted primarily from higher restructuring and other charges and a gross margin percentage decrease driven by pricing erosion partially offset by productivity improvements and product mix partially offset by a revenue increase 

interest and other income loss net 

interest income expense net the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



interest income decreased driven by lower interest rates and lower average balances of cash and availableforsale debt investments the decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance and the impact of lower effective interest rates 

table of contents 

other income loss net the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 



the change in net gains losses on availableforsale debt investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these investments the change in net gains losses on marketable equity investments was attributable to market value fluctuations and the timing of recognition of gains and losses the change in net gains losses on privately held investments was primarily due to higher net unrealized gains and lower impairment charges partially offset by lower realized gains the change in other gains losses net was primarily driven by lower donation expense and favorable impacts from our equity derivatives partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 201 for fiscal 2021 compared with 197 for fiscal 2020 the net 04 percentage points increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit from foreign income taxed at other than us rates offset by an increase in foreignderived intangible income deduction and a decrease in state taxes 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of 70 billion cash returned to stockholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of 29 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of 62 billion net decrease in debt of 30 billion net increase in restricted cash of 08 billion and capital expenditures of 07 billion these uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 155 billion 

in addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business we have approximately 07 billion of the us transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries and 25 billion of longterm debt outstanding at july 31 2021 that will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date see further discussion of liquidity and future payments under “contractual obligations” and “liquidity and capital resource requirements” below 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our availableforsale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position is critical at this time of uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic and allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

securities lending we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale debt investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses we did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented 

free cash flow and capital allocation as part of our capital allocation strategy we intend to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

table of contents 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other required uses of cash including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors 

the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately 79 billion with no termination date 

accounts receivable net   the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions 



our accounts receivable net as of july 31 2021 increased by approximately 5 compared with the end of fiscal 2020 

inventory supply chain the following table summarizes our inventories in millions 



inventory as of july 31 2021 increased by 22 from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2020 the increase in inventory was primarily due to an increase in raw materials partially offset by a decrease in finished goods 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity 

our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure longterm supply and pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we believe our inventory and purchase commitments are in line with our current demand forecasts

the increase in purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers compared with the end of fiscal 2020 was due to arrangements to secure longterm supply and pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods we have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage including revising supplier arrangements to address supply chain challenges 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees the following table summarizes our financing receivables in millions 



financing receivables our financing arrangements include leases loans and financed service contracts lease receivables include salestype leases arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we also provide financing to certain qualified customers for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services the majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed financing receivables decreased by 14 

financing guarantees in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms 

the volume of channel partner financing was 267 billion 269 billion and 296 billion in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was 13 billion and 11 billion as of july 31 2021 and july 25 2020 respectively we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed as of july 31 2021 the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately 160 million of which approximately 21 million was recorded as deferred revenue

remaining performance obligations the following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations in millions 



total remaining performance obligations increased 9 in fiscal 2021 remaining performance obligations for product and service increased 18 and 3 respectively compared to fiscal 2020 

deferred revenue the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



total deferred revenue increased 8 in fiscal 2021 the increase in deferred product revenue of 19 was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings the increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue 

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 31 2021 in millions 



operating leases for more information on our operating leases see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure longterm pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase 

table of contents 

commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” 

other purchase obligations other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

transition tax payable transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the onetime us transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act “the tax act” see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 24 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 134 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our acquisitions we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 02 billion and 03 billion as of july 31 2021 and july 25 2020 respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 31 2021 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

while the covid19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt pending acquisitions future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk we have seen an increase in these risks and related uncertainties with increased volatility in the financial markets in the current environment with the covid19 pandemic 

interest rate risk 

availableforsale debt investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding availableforsale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our availableforsale debt investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates as has also happened recently including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our availableforsale debt investments as of july 31 2021 our availableforsale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading our availableforsale debt investments are not leveraged as of july 31 2021 we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our availableforsale debt investments including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points bps plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of july 31 2021 and july 25 2020 are as follows in millions 





financing receivables as of july 31 2021 our financing receivables had a carrying value of 93 billion compared with 108 billion as of july 25 2020 as of july 31 2021 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt as of july 31 2021 we had 115 billion in principal amount of senior fixedrate notes outstanding the carrying amount of the senior notes was 115 billion and the related fair value based on market prices was 137 billion as of july 31 2021 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 20 billion of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 04 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt that is not hedged 

equity price risk 

marketable equity investments the fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility we hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading as of july 31 2021 the total fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities was 137 million we had no outstanding marketable equity securities as of july 25 2020 

privately held investments these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of july 31 2021 the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held investments was 15 billion compared with 13 billion at july 25 2020 some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of privately held investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 



at july 31 2021 and july 25 2020 we had no option contracts outstanding 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2021 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 214 million or 12 as compared with fiscal 2020 to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes

strategy and priorities 

as our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises and as more applications move to a multicloud environment the network becomes even more critical our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace and our mission is to inspire new possibilities for them by helping transform their infrastructure expand applications and analytics address their security needs and empower their teams we believe that our customers are looking for intentbased networks that provide meaningful business value through automation security and analytics across private hybrid and multicloud environments our vision is to deliver highly secure softwaredefined automated and intelligent platforms for our customers 

we are expanding our research and development rd investments in certain product areas including cloud security cloud collaboration and application insights and analytics we are investing to optimize our product offerings for application to education healthcare and other specific industries we are also making investments to enable us to increase automation and support the customer as the workplace changes in addition we continue to remain focused on investments around softwaredefined wide area network sdwan multicloud environments 5g and wifi6 400g speeds optical networking next generation silicon and artificial intelligence ai we are also accelerating our efforts to enable the delivery of network functionality as a service 

transforming infrastructure 

our intentbased networking strategy began with softwaredefined access sdaccess technology one of our leading enterprise architectures we announced the initial development of new network product offerings featuring our intentbased networking technology with the launch of the catalyst 9000 series of switches our intentbased networking platform is designed to be intelligent highly secure powered by “intent” and informed by “context”— features aiming to constantly learn adapt automate and protect in order to optimize network operations and defend against an evolving cyber threat landscape our intentbased networking offerings are designed to provide a single highly secure network fabric that helps ensure policy consistency and network assurance enables faster launches of new business services and significantly improves issue resolution times while being open and extendable sdaccess built on the principles of cisco digital networking architecture dna provides what we see as a transformational shift in the building and managing of networks our catalyst 9000 series of switches represented the initial build in our campus portfolio of our intentbased networking capabilities and provide highly differentiated advancements in security programmability and performance while lowering operating costs through innovations in hardware and software 

since the initial launch we have continued to transform our enterprise access portfolio by bringing together several technologies to form the only integrated intentbased architecture with security at the foundation this architecture is designed to help our customers connect their users and devices over any network to applications and data no matter where they are 

we have introduced several innovations that extend our intentbased networking capabilities to wireless and enterprise routing products including sdwan and internet of things iot edge platforms our sdwan solutions are designed to provide direct branch to cloud connectivity enabling the workforce to access their softwareasaservice saas applications and workloads in an optimized and highly secure manner 

to further our innovation in this area we are applying the latest technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics to operate and enhance network capabilities these new network product offerings are designed to enable customers to detect cybersecurity threats for instance in encrypted traffic we have created what is in our view the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy 

our customers are operating in multicloud environments with private public and hybrid clouds for the data center our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency regardless of where applications or data reside by extending our application centric infrastructure aci and our hyperconverged offerings 

in fiscal 2020 we announced details of our technology strategy for the internet for the future aimed at addressing the broad adoption of multicloud and application environments we have made significant investments in the development of software silicon and optics — what we believe are the building blocks for the internet for the future 

we introduced cisco silicon one a single unified silicon architecture as well as the cisco 8000 carrierclass router family built on silicon one and our new operating system 

applications and analytics 

in our view over the next several years customers will be increasingly writing modern software applications that can run on any hybrid cloud and will be adding billions of connections to their environment they will need to be able to build applications quickly deploy them nearly anywhere monitor experiences and act in real time 

we believe we are uniquely positioned to enable successful business outcomes for customers in hybrid and multicloud environments in our view the network is increasingly critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms 

as our customers navigate the multicloud world the need to connect new devices protect their assets and monitor cloud consumption they will require advisory cloud services that are provided in a consistent manner we are focused on enabling simple intelligent automated and highly secure clouds by delivering the infrastructure to navigate complex it environments through our software and subscriptionbased offerings including webex meraki cloud networking and certain other security and application offerings we believe that customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique recognizing that we offer a solution for all cloud environments including private hybrid and public clouds 

security is foundational 

we believe data is one of our customers most strategic assets and this data is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem on customer premises at the edge of the network and in the cloud as such we believe that security is the top it priority for many of our customers our security strategy is focused on delivering an effective cybersecurity architecture combining network cloud and endpointbased solutions our portfolio is designed to prevent detect and remediate a cyberattack and to integrate security across networking domains our intent is to enable our customers to secure their networks for a multicloud world by delivering a platform that continuously detects threats and verifies trust by combining a number of security technologies we 

are delivering an endtoend zerotrust architecture additionally through our offerings we help our customers shorten the time between threat detection and response 

empowering teams 

our customers’ communications continue to evolve as we move to a digital cloudbased world as people are an important competitive advantage for our customers teams need effective and simple ways to work better together and interact with their customers to build better relationships and increase collaboration as an example we believe our collaboration portfolio which includes our subscriptionbased webex conferencing platform is at the center of our customers’ strategy for enabling teams to increase productivity 

transforming our business model 

we are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers historically our various networking technology products have aligned with their respective product categories however increasingly our offerings are crossing multiple product categories as our core networking evolves we expect we will add more common software features across our core networking platforms we are increasing the amount of software offerings that we provide and the proportion of subscription software offerings we have various types of software arrangements including system software on premise software hybrid software and saas offerings in terms of monetization our software offerings fall into the broad categories of subscription arrangements including saas and term licenses and perpetual licenses 

as part of the transformation of our business we continued to make strides during fiscal 2020 to develop and sell more software and subscriptionbased offerings we are also focused on the entire customer lifecycle to drive expansion and renewals 

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer accounted for 10 or more of revenue our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise commercial service provider and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

commercial 

we define commercial businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1000 employees we sell to the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or organizations with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain we sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners 

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide this customer market category includes regional national and international wireline carriers webscale operators as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also include media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks whose requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

public sector 

public sector entities include federal governments state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector entities have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector entities through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as through direct sales 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2020  our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 25800 employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in 95 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors typically hold inventory and sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer starting in fiscal 2019 in connection with the adoption of accounting standards codification asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition we started recognizing revenue from twotier distributors on a sellin method prior to this we recognized revenue based on a sellthrough method using point of sales information provided by these distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices receive certain rebates and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “cyberattacks data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation and cyberattacks or data breaches on our customers networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and software maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as “build buy partner invest and codevelop” this fiveprong approach to how we innovate can be summarized as follows 



acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to generate revenue no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies with which we have added or expanded strategic alliances during fiscal 2020 and in recent years include apple google microsoft and amazon web services among others 

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services designed to transport and help secure data voice and video traffic across cloud private and public networks and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors in each case relative to only some of our products or services include amazon web services llc arista networks inc broadcom inc commscope holding company inc check point software technologies ltd dell technologies inc dynatrace f5 networks inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard enterprise company huawei technologies co ltd juniper networks inc lenovo group limited logmein inc microsoft corporation new relic inc nokia corporation nutanix inc palo alto networks inc ringcentral inc slack technologies inc ubiquiti networks vmware inc zoom video communications inc and zscaler inc among others 

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits asics offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

research and development 

we regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of infrastructure platforms applications security and other product technologies our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of increased focus include our intentbased networking technologies which encompasses switching routing and wireless technologies within infrastructure platforms conferencing security and analytics products our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internet working products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully 

develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses”

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our business results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations in the second half of fiscal 2020 the covid19 pandemic had an impact on our financial results and business operations with a significant impact in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints the magnitude and duration of the disruption its continuing impact on us and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain these disruptions include the unprecedented actions taken to try to contain the pandemic such as travel bans and restrictions business closures and social distancing measures such as quarantines and shelterinplace orders 

the covid19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition shelterinplace orders and other measures including workfromhome and other policies implemented to protect workers has and could in the future impact our supply chain vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business regulatory or political reasons andor demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply such disruptions may continue or worsen in the future in addition current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation such as reduced availability of air transport port closures and increased border controls or closures can also impact our ability to meet customer demand and could materially adversely affect us our customers have also experienced and may continue to experience disruptions in their operations which can result in delayed reduced or canceled orders and increased collection risks and which may adversely affect our results of operations the covid19 pandemic may also result in longterm changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors along with it 

related capital spending reductions or shifts in spending focus that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs 

the recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges for example governmental lockdowns restrictions or new regulations has and could in the future impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work with the same speed and productivity in certain areas even as other areas do not see negative impact the extent andor duration of ongoing workforce restrictions and limitations could impact our ability to enhance develop and support existing products and services and hold product sales and marketing events to the extent we were able to previously in addition malefactors are seeking to use the covid19 pandemic to launch new cyberattacks see the risk factors below entitled “cyberattacks data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation and cyberattacks or data breaches on our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business” and “vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of third party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business” 

the covid19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future the inputs into certain of our judgments assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the covid19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates as the covid19 pandemic continues to develop many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods 

we are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control including without limitation the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines the imposition of protective public safety measures and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy potential negative impacts of these external factors include but are not limited to material adverse effects on demand for our products and services our supply chain and sales and distribution channels collectability of customer accounts our ability to execute strategic plans impairments and our profitability and cost structure to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include   



































as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 













the global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent and is being significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic during fiscal 2020 we continued to see a more broadbased weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets we also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets additionally instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the united kingdom “brexit” withdrawal from the european union the current economic challenges in china including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in product orders in fiscal 2020 and in certain prior periods 

in addition reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect customers’ perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states trust and confidence in us as an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas such as security and applications while also focusing on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services however the return on our investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment the significant impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related market uncertainty during fiscal 2020 we continued to see a more broadbased weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets we also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets 

our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did during fiscal 2020 and in certain prior periods on a yearoveryear basis our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

although our product gross margin increased in fiscal 2020 our level of product gross margins declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and have declined in certain prior periods on a yearoveryear basis and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors including   



































changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other infrastructure platforms and applications products in addition to longer sales cycles service provider product orders decreased during fiscal 2020 and in certain prior periods and at various times in the past including in recent quarters we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and as has been the case in the past such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic 

and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic political or regulatory uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 









in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas and in key priority and growth areas for example as products related to network programmability such as software defined networking sdn products become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware referred to as “white box” hardware to the extent customers decide to purchase those product 

offerings instead of ours in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market 

as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 business of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors asics offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 























we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 







a reduction or interruption in supply including disruptions on our global supply chain as a result of the covid19 pandemic a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand in the industry for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or the reramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance 

that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future   







manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

we depend upon the development of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product and service introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products if customers do not purchase andor renew our offerings our business could be harmed the covid19 pandemic may also result in longterm changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors along with itrelated capital spending reductions or shifts in spending focus that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs 

the process of developing new technology including intentbased networking more programmable flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions— such as security digital transformation and iot and cloud— is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such as for example networking products based on “white box” hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in a timely fashion offerings to address other transitions or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings 

we have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology including changes in our business models with customers if our strategy for addressing our customer needs or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed 

furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market the success of new products and services depends on several factors including proper new product and service definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products and services differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products and services there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products services and technologies developed by others will not render our products services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction or restructuring costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

we initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 which includes a voluntary early retirement program the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service and marketing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas such as security and applications and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated market transitions and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 















acquisitions may also cause us to   



















mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence for example as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of 125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widelyused component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products and in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pretax charge of 655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries we also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in fiscal 2020 and in certain prior periods we continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states including impacts from global central bank monetary policy issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries that can affect regulatory matters affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states or affect our ability to procure components if a government body were to deny us access to those components governmentrelated disruptions or shutdowns and the challenging 

and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following 















we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements 

we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial 

resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our portfolio includes availableforsale debt investments and equity investments the values of which are subject to market price volatility if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis our nonmarketable equity and other investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies for information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance 

even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations see note 14e to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition including “net neutrality” rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total remaining asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to 155 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes 756 million for interest and 383 million for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 25 2020  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements subsection f “legal proceedings” 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction foreignderived intangible income global intangible lowtax income and base erosion and antiabuse tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 37 countries including the united states has made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

cyberattacks data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation and cyberattacks or data breaches on our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

despite our implementation of security measures the products and services we sell to customers and our servers data centers and the cloudbased solutions on which our data and data of our customers suppliers and business partners are stored are vulnerable to cyberattacks data breaches malware and similar disruptions from unauthorized access or tampering by malicious actors or inadvertent error any such event could compromise our products services and networks or those of our customers and the information stored on our systems or those of our customers could be improperly accessed processed disclosed lost or stolen which could subject us to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others give rise to legalregulatory action and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance and may not be successful breaches of security in our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of third party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

the products and services we sell to customers and our cloudbased solutions inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security we may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes which could result in an exploit which compromises security customers also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation in addition we rely on thirdparty providers of software and cloudbased service and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities customers may also not deploy a security release or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products services or cloudbased solutions containing the release leaving them vulnerable vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of thirdparty providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

terrorism and other events may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy transportation or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and in the past have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected 

benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

as of the end of fiscal 2020 we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 145 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2021 through 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 100 billion  and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 25 2020  the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our whollyowned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances

a summary of our results is as follows in millions except percentages and pershare amounts 



1 during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 we completed the sale of our spvss business as a result revenue from this business will not recur in future periods includes spvss business revenue of 168 million for fiscal 2019 

2 i ncludes a 09 billion charge for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2019 related to the tax act 

fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 

in fiscal 2020 we delivered growth in margins and earnings per share in a very challenging environment with the covid19 pandemic total revenue decreased by 5 compared with fiscal 2019  our product revenue declined in infrastructure platforms and applications partially offset by growth in security and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities we continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment we saw broadbased weakening in the global macroeconomic environment during the fiscal year which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets we also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets while the overall environment remains uncertain we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term 

within total revenue product revenue decreased 8 and service revenue increased by 3  total gross margin increased by 14 percentage points driven primarily by productivity benefits and product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 08 percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 02 percentage points diluted earnings per share increased by 1  driven by a decrease in diluted share count of 199 million shares partially offset by a decrease in net income of 4  

in terms of our geographic segments revenue from the americas decreased by 16 billion  driven in large part by a product revenue decline in the united states emea revenue decreased by 04 billion and revenue in our apjc segment decreased by 05 billion  the “bricm” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 25 in the aggregate driven by decreased product revenue in the emerging countries of india china mexico and brazil 

from a customer market standpoint we experienced product revenue declines across all customer segments with the most significant declines in the commercial and service provider markets during fiscal 2020 we saw a decline in business momentum in the commercial and enterprise markets which we believe was significantly related to weakness in the global macroeconomic environment 

from a product category perspective total product revenue decreased 8 year over year the decrease was driven by declines in revenue in infrastructure platforms and applications of 10 and 4  respectively these declines were partially offset by a product revenue increase in security of 12  

fourth quarter snapshot 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  total revenue decreased by 9  within total revenue product revenue decreased by 13 and service revenue was flat with regard to our geographic segment performance on a yearoveryear basis revenue in the americas emea and apjc decreased by 12  6 and 7 respectively from a product category perspective we experienced product revenue declines in infrastructure platforms and applications offset by growth in security total gross margin decreased by 07 percentage points driven by unfavorable pricing partially offset by favorable product mix as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 06 percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 08 percentage points diluted earnings per share increased by 22 and net income increased by 19  the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 included a 09 billion tax charge related to the tax act

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 in millions 



critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

the inputs into certain of our judgments assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the covid19 pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates the covid19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our significant judgments assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2020 these estimates include goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes among other items the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates as the covid19 pandemic continues to develop many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility as events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods 

revenue recognition 

we enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations as a result our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations we determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software licenses and saas as distinct performance obligations term software licenses represent multiple obligations which include software licenses and software maintenance in transactions where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis 

we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided saas arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services on our product sales we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales we record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes 

revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices ssp ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers in instances where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs 

we apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors channel partners and customers when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these programs applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available we also consider the customers right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018  for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2020  the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 728 billion for the americas 516 billion for emea and 313 billion for apjc 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits domestic manufacturing deductions foreignderived intangible income deductions global intangible lowtaxed income tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 197  202  and 992 in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018  respectively 

during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 we recorded a total tax charge of 113 billion consisting of 9 billion of tax expense for the us transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 12 billion of foreign withholding tax and 11 billion of tax expense for dta remeasurement as a result of the tax act 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction foreignderived intangible income deduction global intangible lowtax income and base erosion and antiabuse tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 37 countries including the united states has made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

results of operations 

a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is presented below a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can be found under item 7 in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended july 27 2019 filed with the sec on september 5 2019 which is available free of charge on the sec’s website at wwwsecgov and our investor relations website at investorciscocom 

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



1 total revenue and product revenue not including the spvss business in the prior year decreased 5 and 7 respectively service revenue not including the spvss business in the prior year increased 3 

we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

total revenue in fiscal 2020 decreased by 5 compared with fiscal 2019  product revenue decreased by 8 and service revenue increased by 3  our total revenue reflected declines across each of our geographic segments product revenue for the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced a 25 product revenue decline with decreases in india china mexico and brazil 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes we report our product revenue in the following categories infrastructure platforms applications security and other products this aligns our product categories with our evolving business model prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation 

the following table presents revenue for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

infrastructure platforms 

the infrastructure platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching routing wireless and the data center infrastructure platforms revenue decreased by 10  or 30 billion  this was the product area most impacted by the covid19 pandemic environment in the second half of fiscal 2020 switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching although we had revenue growth in our intentbased networking catalyst 9000 series we experienced a decrease in sales of routing products with declines primarily in the service provider and enterprise markets revenue from wireless products declined although we saw revenue growth in our meraki and wifi6 products revenue from data center declined driven by continued market contraction impacting primarily our servers products 

applications 

the applications product category includes our collaboration offerings unified communications cisco telepresence and conferencing as well as iot and appdynamics analytics software offerings revenue in our applications product category decreased by 4  or 235 million  with a decline in unified communications and cisco telepresence partially offset by double digit growth in appdynamics and growth in iot software offerings and webex 

security 

revenue in our security product category increased 12  or 333 million  driven by higher sales of identity and access advanced threat security unified threat management and web security products revenue from our cloud security portfolio reflected strong doubledigit growth and continued momentum with our duo and umbrella offerings 

other products 

the decrease in revenue from our other products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from the spvss business which we divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 

service revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

service revenue increased 3  driven by an increase in software and solution support offerings service revenue increased in all geographic segments 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 



product gross margin 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020  



1 productivity includes overall manufacturingrelated costs such as component costs warranty expense provision for inventory freight logistics shipment volume and other items not categorized elsewhere 

product gross margin increased by 14 percentage points driven by productivity improvements and favorable product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing in the second half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic we incurred additional logistics costs such as freight which had a negative impact on product gross margin our product gross margin benefited slightly from the sale of our lower margin spvss business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 

productivity improvements were driven by memory cost savings and other cost reductions including value engineering efforts eg component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes and continued operational efficiency 

in manufacturing operations the negative pricing impact which was higher than the yearoveryear impact we experienced in fiscal 2019 was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments the favorable product mix impact was driven by impacts from each of our product categories 

service gross margin 

our service gross margin percentage increased by 07 percentage point primarily due to higher sales volume 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



1 the unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense significant litigation settlements and other contingencies charges related to asset impairments and restructurings and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

we experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our americas segment due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing 

product gross margin in our emea segment increased due to productivity improvements and to a lesser extent favorable product mix partially offset by negative impacts from pricing 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage increase was due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix partially offset by negative impacts from pricing higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the gross margin in this geographic segment 

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment 

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



rd expenses 

rd expenses decreased due to lower headcountrelated expenses lower discretionary spending and lower contracted services spending partially offset by higher sharebased compensation expense 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower discretionary spending and contracted services spending 

ga expenses 

ga expenses increased due to the benefit from the 400 million litigation settlement with arista networks inc “arista” in fiscal 2019 and higher discretionary spending partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of property that had been held for sale lower headcountrelated expenses lower contracted services spending and lower sharebased compensation expense 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2020  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 141 million  or 08  compared with fiscal 2019  

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets in millions 

the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions 

restructuring and other charges 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we initiated a restructuring plan which includes a voluntary early retirement program in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas the total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately 900 million  we expect the plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021 and estimate it will generate cost savings of approximately 10 billion on an annualized basis over the next few quarters 

the following table presents restructuring and other charges in millions 

we initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2020 in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas with estimated pretax charges of approximately 300 million  in connection with this restructuring plan we incurred charges of 255 million during fiscal 2020  we expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021 

we incurred total restructuring and other charges of 481 million in fiscal 2020  we incurred charges of 255 million related to the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2020 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced during fiscal 2018 

these charges were primarily cashbased and consisted of employee severance and other onetime termination benefits and other costs we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas as a result the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

operating income decreased by 4  and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 02 percentage points these changes resulted primarily from a revenue decrease the impact of the benefit from the 400 million litigation settlement with arista in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and higher restructuring and other charges partially offset by a gross margin percentage increase driven by productivity improvements and product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing 

interest and other income loss net 

interest income expense net the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



interest income decreased driven by a lower average balance of cash and availableforsale debt investments and lower interest rates the decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance and the impact of lower effective interest rates 

other income loss net the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 

the total change in net gains losses on availableforsale debt investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these investments the change in net gains losses on nonmarketable equity and other investments was primarily due to higher realized gains and higher unrealized gains partially offset by higher impairment charges the change in other gains losses net was primarily driven by higher donation expense as related to covid19 programs partially offset by net favorable foreign exchange impacts 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 197 for fiscal 2020  compared with 202 for fiscal 2019  the net 05 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in net discrete tax charges 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by a net decrease in debt of 102 billion  cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of 27 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of 60 billion  capital expenditures of 08 billion and net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of 03 billion  these uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 154 billion  

in addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business on july 9 2019 we announced our intent to acquire acacia communications inc for a net purchase consideration of approximately 26 billion in cash additionally approximately 07 billion of the us transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries and 30 billion of longterm debt outstanding at july 25 2020 will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date see further discussion of liquidity and future payments under “contractual obligations” and “liquidity and capital resource requirements” below 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our availableforsale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position is critical at this time of uncertainty due to the covid19 pandemic and allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

securities lending we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale debt investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses we did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented 

free cash flow and capital allocation as part of our capital allocation strategy we intend to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other required uses of cash including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors 

the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately 108 billion  with no termination date 

accounts receivable net   the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions 



our accounts receivable net as of july 25 2020 was flat compared with the end of fiscal 2019  

inventory supply chain the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions 



inventory as of july 25 2020 decreased by 7 from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2019  and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 11  on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 10 compared with the end of fiscal 2019  the decrease in inventory was primarily due to a decrease in finished goods and lower deferred cost of sales partially offset by an increase in raw materials 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity 

our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure longterm pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees the following table summarizes our financing receivables in millions 



financing receivables our financing arrangements include leases loans and financed service contracts lease receivables include salestype leases arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we also provide financing to certain qualified customers for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services the majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed financing receivables increased by 7  

financing guarantees in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days during fiscal 2020 we expanded the payment terms on certain of our channel partner financing programs by 30 days in response to the covid19 pandemic environment in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms 

the volume of channel partner financing was 269 billion  296 billion  and 282 billion in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018  respectively these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was 11 billion and 14 billion as of july 25 2020 and july 27 2019  respectively we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed as of july 25 2020  the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately 207 million  of which approximately 28 million was recorded as deferred revenue 

covid19 business resiliency program at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we initiated a new business resiliency program designed to help customers and channel partners mitigate financial challenges resulting from the covid19 pandemic this program includes 25 billion in currently available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions the new business resiliency program offered by us includes an upfront 90day payment holiday and allows a customer to defer 95 percent of the payments for a new product or solution until calendar 2021 which in turn protects their business and increases their existing cash flow 

borrowings 

senior notes the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 



interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 25 2020  

commercial paper we have a shortterm debt financing program in which up to 100 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes we had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 25 2020  we had 42 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 27 2019  

credit facility on may 15 2020 we entered into a 364day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 275 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on may 14 2021 the credit agreement is structured as an amendment and restatement of our fiveyear credit facility which would have terminated on may 15 2020 the end of its fiveyear term as of july 25 2020  we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or c libor or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the administrative agent “eurocurrency rate” for an interest period of one month plus 100 or ii the eurocurrency rate plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc provided that in no event will the eurocurrency rate be less than 025 we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion this credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 

deferred revenue the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



total deferred revenue increased 11 in fiscal 2020  the increase in deferred product revenue of 17 was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings the increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue 

remaining performance obligations the following table presents the breakdown of remaining performance obligations in millions 



total remaining performance obligations increased 12 in fiscal 2020  remaining performance obligations for product and service increased 17 and 9  respectively compared to fiscal 2019  

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 25 2020 in millions 



operating leases for more information on our operating leases see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure longterm pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and 

unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” 

other purchase obligations other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

transition tax payable transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the onetime us transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax act see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 19 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 81 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our acquisitions we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our nonmarketable equity and other investments some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 03 billion as of each of july 25 2020 and july 27 2019  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have nonmarketable equity and other investments and provide financing to certain customers certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our nonmarketable equity and other investments and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 25 2020 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our nonmarketable equity and other investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

while the covid19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt pending acquisitions future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk we have seen an increase in these risks and related uncertainties with increased volatility in the financial markets in the current environment with the covid19 pandemic 

interest rate risk 

availableforsale debt investments we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding availableforsale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our availableforsale debt investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates as has also happened recently including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our availableforsale debt investments as of july 25 2020  our availableforsale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading our availableforsale debt investments are not leveraged as of july 25 2020  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our availableforsale debt investments including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points bps plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps the hypothetical fair values as of july 25 2020 and july 27 2019 are as follows in millions 

  





financing receivables as of july 25 2020  our financing receivables had a carrying value of 108 billion  compared with 101 billion as of july 27 2019  as of july 25 2020  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt as of july 25 2020  we had 145 billion in principal amount of senior fixedrate notes outstanding the carrying amount of the senior notes was 146 billion  and the related fair value based on market prices was 174 billion  as of july 25 2020  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 25 billion of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 05 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt that is not hedged 

equity price risk 

marketable equity investments the fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading we had no outstanding marketable equity securities as of july 25 2020  

nonmarketable equity and other investments these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of july 25 2020  the total carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity and other investments was 13 billion  compared with 12 billion at july 27 2019  some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of nonmarketable equity and other investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 

at july 25 2020 and july 27 2019  we had no option contracts outstanding 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2020  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 141 million  or 08  as compared with fiscal 2019  to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes

strategy and priorities   

as our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises and as more applications move to a multicloud environment the network continues to be extremely critical we believe that our customers are looking for intentbased networks that provide meaningful business value through automation security and analytics across private hybrid and multicloud environments our vision is to deliver highly secure softwaredefined automated and intelligent platforms for our customers our strategic priorities include the following accelerating our pace of innovation increasing the value of the network and transforming our business model   

accelerating pace of innovation — enabling   network automation 

the initial development of new network product offerings that feature our intentbased networking technology was announced in fiscal 2017 the intentbased networking platform is designed to be intelligent highly secure powered by “intent” and informed by “context”— features aiming to constantly learn adapt automate and protect in order to optimize network operations and defend against an evolving cyber threat landscape our intentbased network started with the softwaredefined access sdaccess technology one of our leading enterprise architectures these offerings are designed to provide a single highly secure network fabric that helps ensure policy consistency and network assurance enables faster launches of new business services and significantly improves issue resolution times while being open and extendable sdaccess built on the principles of cisco digital networking architecture dna provides what we see as a transformational shift in the building and managing of networks our catalyst 

9000 series of switches represented the initial build of our intentbased networking capabilities and provides highly differentiated advancements in security programmability and performance while lowering operating costs by innovating hardware and software 

since the initial launch we have integrated intentbased networking across our enterprise access portfolio to help our customers manage more users devices and things connecting to their networks to enable our customers to do this we have introduced several innovations that extend our intentbased networking capabilities to wireless and enterprise routing products including softwaredefined wide area network sdwan and internet of things iot edge platforms 

to further our innovation in this area we are applying the latest technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics to operate and enhance network capabilities these new network product offerings are designed to enable customers to detect cybersecurity threats for instance in encrypted traffic we have created what is in our view the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy 

for the data center our strategy is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency regardless of where applications or data reside by extending our application centric infrastructure aci and our hyperconverged offerings 

increasing the value of the network 

unlocking the power of data      our customers are increasingly using technology including networks to grow their businesses drive efficiencies and more effectively compete we believe data is one of an organizations most strategic assets and this data is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem on customer premises at the edge of the network and in the cloud as the number of new devices connected to the internet grows we believe the network will play an even more critical role in enabling our customers to aggregate automate and draw actionable insights from this highly distributed data where there is a premium on security and speed we believe this is driving our customers to adopt new it architectures and organizational structures and more specifically to seek network deployment solutions that deliver greater agility productivity visibility security and other advanced network capabilities 

security is foundational   we believe that security is the top it priority for many of our customers our security strategy is focused on delivering an effective cybersecurity architecture combining network cloud and endpointbased solutions our portfolio is designed to prevent detect and remediate a cyberattack and to integrate security across networking domains our intent is to enable our customers to secure their networks for a multicloud world by delivering a platform that continuously detects threats and verifies trust by combining a number of security technologies we are delivering an endtoend zerotrust architecture additionally through our offerings we help our customers shorten the time between threat detection and response 

powering a multicloud world   our customers are operating in multicloud environments with private public and hybrid clouds our cloud strategy is to deliver solutions designed to simplify secure and transform how customers work in this multicloud world to maximize business outcomes 

as our customers navigate the multicloud world they need to connect new devices protect their assets and monitor cloud consumption and they also require advisory cloud services that are provided in a consistent manner we are focused on enabling simple intelligent automated and highly secure clouds by delivering the infrastructure to navigate complex it environments through our software and subscriptionbased offerings including webex meraki cloud networking and certain other security and applications offerings we believe that customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique recognizing that we offer a solution for all cloud environments including private hybrid and public clouds 

in our view over the next several years customers will be increasingly writing modern applications that can run on any hybrid cloud and will be adding billions of connections to their environment we believe cisco is uniquely positioned to enable successful business outcomes for customers in hybrid and multicloud environments in our view the network has never been more critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms 

transforming our business model 

we are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers as part of the transformation of our business we continued to make strides during fiscal 2019 to develop and sell more software and subscriptionbased offerings historically our various networking technology products have aligned with their respective product categories however increasingly our offerings are crossing multiple product categories as our core networking evolves we expect we will add more common software features across our core networking platforms we are increasing the amount of software offerings that we provide and the proportion of subscription software offerings we have various types of software arrangements including system software on premise software hybrid software and saas offerings in terms of monetization our software offerings fall into the broad categories of subscription arrangements including saas and term licenses and perpetual licenses 

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

we believe this strategy along with our architectural approach and networking expertise has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors 

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no  single customer accounted for 10  or more of revenue our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise commercial service provider and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

commercial 

we define commercial businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1000 employees we sell to the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or organizations with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain we sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners 

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide this customer market category includes regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also include media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks whose requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

public sector 

public sector entities include federal governments state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector entities have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector entities through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as through direct sales 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2019  our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 26200  employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in 97 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors typically hold inventory and sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer starting in fiscal 2019 in connection with the adoption of accounting standards codification asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition we started recognizing revenue from twotier distributors on a sellin method for further discussion of asc 606 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements prior to this we recognized revenue based on a sellthrough method using point of sales information provided by these distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices receive certain rebates and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “cyberattacks data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation and cyberattacks or data breaches on our customers networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and software maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as “build buy partner invest and codevelop” this fiveprong approach to how we innovate can be summarized as follows 



acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to generate revenue no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies with which we have added or expanded strategic alliances during fiscal 2019  and in recent years include google and amazon web services among others 

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors in each case relative to only some of our products or services include amazon web services llc arista networks inc broadcom inc commscope holding company inc check point software technologies ltd dell technologies inc extreme networks inc f5 networks inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard enterprise company huawei technologies co ltd juniper networks inc lenovo group limited logmein inc microsoft corporation new relic inc nokia corporation nutanix inc palo alto networks inc slack technologies inc symantec corporation ubiquiti networks vmware inc zoom video communications inc and zscaler inc among others   

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits asics offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 



 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success   

research and development 

we regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of infrastructure platforms applications security and other product technologies our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of increased focus include our intentbased networking technologies which encompasses switching routing and wireless technologies within infrastructure platforms security and analytics products our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internet working products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses”

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include   



































as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 













the global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the pending united kingdom “brexit” withdrawal from the european union the current economic challenges in china including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition   

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in product orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and in certain prior periods 

in addition reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect customers’ perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states trust and confidence in us as an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory actions taken in response 

to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas such as security and applications while also focusing on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services however the return on our investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty 

our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and in certain prior periods on a yearoveryear basis our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

although our product gross margin increased in fiscal 2019 our level of product gross margins have declined in certain prior periods on a yearoveryear basis and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors including   



































changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other infrastructure platforms and applications products in addition to longer sales cycles service provider product orders decreased during fiscal 2019 and in certain prior periods and at various times in the past including in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and as has been the case in the past such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic political or regulatory uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often 

require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 









in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas and in key priority and growth areas for example as products related to network programmability such as sdn products become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware referred to as white box hardware to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market 

as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 business  of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face 

competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors asics offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 



  



















we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 







a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand in the industry for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or the reramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future   







manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

we depend upon the development of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product and service introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products if customers do not purchase andor renew our offerings our business could be harmed 

the process of developing new technology including intentbased networking more programmable flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions— such as security digital transformation and iot and cloud— is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such as for example networking products based on “white box” hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in a timely fashion offerings to address other transitions or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings 

we have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology including changes in our business models with customers if our strategy for addressing our customer needs or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed 

furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market the success of new products and services depends on several factors including proper new product and service definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products and services differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products and services there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products services and technologies developed by others will not render our products services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our 

other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction or restructuring costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

we initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 which we expect to substantially complete in the first half of fiscal 2020 the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service and marketing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas such as security and applications and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated market transitions and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 















acquisitions may also cause us to   



















mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence for example as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of 125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widelyused component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products and in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pretax charge of 655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries we also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and in certain prior periods we continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states including impacts from global central bank monetary policy issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries that can affect regulatory matters affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states or affect our ability to procure components if a government body were to deny us access to those components governmentrelated disruptions or shutdowns and the challenging 

and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following 















we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements 

we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our portfolio includes availableforsale debt investments and equity investments the values of which are subject to market price volatility if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary our nonmarketable equity and other investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies for information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations see note 13f to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition including net neutrality rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state 

of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to 214 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes 14 billion  for interest and 10 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 27 2019  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements subsection g legal proceedings 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction foreignderived intangible income global intangible lowtax income and base erosion and antiabuse tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 36 countries including the united states has made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

cyberattacks data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation and cyberattacks or data breaches on our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

despite our implementation of security measures the products and services we sell to customers and our servers data centers and the cloudbased solutions on which our data and data of our customers suppliers and business partners are stored are vulnerable to cyberattacks data breaches malware and similar disruptions from unauthorized access or tampering by malicious actors or inadvertent error any such event could compromise our products services and networks or those of our customers and the information stored on our systems or those of our customers could be improperly accessed processed disclosed lost or stolen which could subject us to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others give rise to legalregulatory action and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance and may not be successful breaches of security in our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of third party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

the products and services we sell to customers and our cloudbased solutions inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security we may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes which could result in an exploit which compromises security customers also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation in addition we rely on thirdparty providers of software and cloudbased service and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities customers may also not deploy a security release or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products services or cloudbased solutions containing the release leaving them vulnerable vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of thirdparty providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

terrorism and other events may harm our business operating results and financial condition 

the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy transportation or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and in the past have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

as of the end of fiscal 2019 we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 205 billion  that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2019 through 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 100 billion  and we had   42 billion  in commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 27 2019  the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually except 05 billion  of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our whollyowned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances

a summary of our results is as follows in millions except percentages and pershare amounts 



we adopted asc 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for impact of this adoption on our operating results in fiscal 2019 

1 during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 we completed the sale of our spvss business as a result revenue from this business will not recur in future periods includes spvss business revenue of 0 and 206 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively and 168 million and 903 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively 

2 i ncludes a 09 billion charge and a 09 billion benefit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively and charges of 09 billion and 104 billion for fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively related to the tax act 

nm  not meaningful 

fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 

in fiscal 2019 we had strong performance across the business and delivered growth in revenue margins net income earnings per share and operating cash flow we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities our product revenue reflected growth in infrastructure platforms applications and security and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions notwithstanding the fiscal 2019 results we continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment we expect ongoing uncertainty in the service provider customer market while the overall environment remains uncertain we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term 

total revenue increased by 5  compared with fiscal 2018  within total revenue product revenue increased 6  and service revenue increased by 2  in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 on october 28 2018 we completed the sale of our spvss business total revenue for fiscal 2019 increased 7 not including revenue from the spvss business for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 total gross margin increased by 09  percentage points driven primarily by productivity benefits partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix our gross margin also benefited from the sale of our lower margin spvss business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and the 127 million legal and indemnification settlement charge recorded in fiscal 2018 as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 13  percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 24  percentage points net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 included the onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries foreign withholding taxes and remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities as related to the tax act 

in terms of our geographic segments revenue from the americas increased by 19 billion  driven in large part by product revenue growth in the united states emea revenue increased by 07 billion  and revenue in our apjc segment increased slightly the “bricm” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 1 in the aggregate driven by a 16 decrease in product revenue in china this decrease was partially offset by increased product revenue in mexico russia and india of 26 6 and 5 respectively 

from a customer market standpoint we experienced product revenue growth in the enterprise public sector and commercial markets partially offset by a product revenue decline in the service provider market 

from a product category perspective total product revenue not including spvss products in the prior year increased 8 year over year the increase was driven by growth in security and applications of 16  and 15  respectively we also experienced a 7  product revenue increase in infrastructure platforms 

fourth quarter snapshot 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  total revenue increased by 5  within total revenue product revenue increased by 5  and service revenue increased by 3  with regard to our geographic segment performance on a yearoveryear basis revenue in the americas and emea increased by 8  and 4  respectively while revenue in apjc decreased by 5  from a product category perspective we experienced broad strength across the portfolio we experienced weakness in the service provider market due to ongoing uncertainty in that market total gross margin increased by 22  percentage points driven by improved productivity benefits and favorable product mix partially offset by unfavorable pricing as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 06  percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 14  percentage points diluted earnings per share decreased by 37  and net income decreased by 42  due to a 09 billion tax charge and 09 billion tax benefit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively related to the tax act

for a full discussion of our strategy and priorities see “item 1 business” 

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2019  compared with fiscal 2018  in millions 



1  deferred revenue decreased primarily due to the adoption of asc 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of this adoption 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition asc 606 supersedes nearly all us gaap on revenue recognition and eliminated industryspecific guidance the underlying principle of asc 606 is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services 

asc 606 allowed two methods of adoption i retrospectively to each prior period presented “full retrospective method” or ii retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings as of the date of adoption “modified retrospective method” at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019 we adopted asc 606 using the modified retrospective method to those contracts that were not completed as of july 28 2018 

asc 606 primarily impacted our revenue recognition for software arrangements and sales to twotier distributors in both areas the new standard accelerates the recognition of revenue 

we enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations as a result our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations we determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software licenses and softwareasaservice saas as distinct performance obligations term software licenses represent multiple obligations which include software licenses and software maintenance in transactions where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis 

we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided saas arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services on our product sales we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales we record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes 

revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices ssp ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers in instances where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs 

we apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration includes various rebate cooperative marketing potential penalties and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors partners and customers when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these programs applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available we also consider the customers right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

see notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements for more details 

allowances for receivables and sales returns 

the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions except percentages 



1   calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates which are published by major thirdparty creditrating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts if a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis we consider historical experience credit quality and age of receivable balances and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis we use expected default frequency rates published by a major thirdparty creditrating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation are complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our operating results both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 

a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates the reserve for future sales returns as of july 27 2019  and july 28 2018  was 84 million  and 123 million  respectively and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory 

our provision for inventory was 77 million  63 million  and 74 million  in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017  respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 95 million  105 million  and 124 million  in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017  respectively if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments 

loss contingencies and product warranties 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 

if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our profitability could be adversely affected 

impairment of investments 

we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our availableforsale debt investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these securities to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected we consider all available information including past events current conditions the remaining payment terms of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of underlying collateral 

we hold nonmarketable equity and other investments some of which are in startup or development stage companies as of july 27 2019  our nonmarketable equity and other investments were 12 billion  compared with 11 billion as of july 28 2018  and were included in other assets we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 27 2019  and july 28 2018  was 335 billion  and 317 billion  respectively the increase in goodwill during fiscal 2019  was due in large part to our acquisition of duo security inc in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017  for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2019  the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 692 billion for the americas 563 billion for emea and 322 billion for apjc 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets was approximately 47 million  for fiscal 2017  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits domestic manufacturing deductions foreignderived intangible income deductions global intangible lowtaxed income tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 202  992  and 218  in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017  respectively 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted the tax act significantly revises the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate “federal tax rate” from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax act enactment we recorded a provisional tax expense of 104 billion in fiscal 2018 the provisional tax expense included an 863 million benefit associated with the us taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition fiscal year as previously disclosed the benefit could be subject to reduction or elimination by subsequent government action in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we recorded an 872 million  charge which was the reversal of the previously recorded benefit associated with the us taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018 as a result of a retroactive final us treasury regulation issued during the quarter the total tax charge as a result of the tax act was 113 billion consisting of 9 billion of tax expense for the us transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries 12 billion of foreign withholding tax and 11 billion of tax expense for dta remeasurement 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred 

tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction foreignderived intangible income deduction global intangible lowtax income and base erosion and antiabuse tax laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 36 countries including the united states has made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

results of operations 

a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 is presented below a discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 can be found under item 7 in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended july 28 2018 filed with the sec on september 6 2018 which is available free of charge on the sec’s website at wwwsecgov and our investor relations website at investorciscocom 

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



1 total revenue product revenue and service revenue not including the spvss business in the prior year increased 7 8 and 3 respectively 

we manage our business on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

total revenue in fiscal 2019 increased by 5  compared with fiscal 2018 product revenue increased by 6  and service revenue increased by 2  our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments product revenue for the bricm countries in the aggregate experienced 1 product revenue decline driven by a 16 decrease in product revenue in china and a decrease of 1 in brazil these decreases were partially offset by increased product revenue in mexico russia and india of 26 6 and 5 respectively 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment 

product revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

americas 

product revenue in the americas segment increased by 8  driven by growth in the enterprise public sector and commercial markets these increases were partially offset by a product revenue decline in the service provider market from a country perspective product revenue increased by 9 in the united states 26 in mexico and 6 in canada partially offset by a product revenue decrease of 1 in brazil 

emea 

the increase in product revenue in the emea segment of 6  was driven by growth in the public sector and enterprise markets partially offset by a decline in the service provider market product revenue in the commercial market was flat product revenue from emerging countries within emea increased by 9 and product revenue for the remainder of the emea segment increased by 5 

apjc 

product revenue in the apjc segment increased by 1  driven by growth in the public sector and enterprise markets partially offset by declines in the service provider and commercial markets from a country perspective product revenue increased by 9 in japan and 5 in india partially offset by a product revenue decrease of 16 in china 

product revenue by groups of similar products 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes we report our product revenue in the following categories infrastructure platforms applications security and other products this aligns our product categories with our evolving business model prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation 

the following table presents revenue for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

infrastructure platforms 

the infrastructure platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching routing wireless and the data center infrastructure platforms revenue increased by 7  or 1869 million  with growth across the portfolio switching had solid growth with strong revenue growth in campus switching driven by an increase in sales of our intentbased networking catalyst 9000 series and with growth in data center switching driven by increased revenue from our aci portfolio routing experienced modest revenue growth driven by an increase in sales of sdwan products partially offset by weakness in the service provider market we experienced double digit revenue growth from wireless products driven by increases across the portfolio revenue from data center increased driven by higher sales of hyperflex and our server products 

applications 

the applications product category includes our collaboration offerings unified communications cisco telepresence and conferencing as well as iot and appdynamics analytics software offerings revenue in our applications product category increased by 15  or 767 million  with double digit growth in unified communications telepresence appdynamics and iot software 

security 

revenue in our security product category increased 16  or 378 million  driven by higher sales of identity and access advanced threat security unified threat management and web security products the duo acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 also contributed to the revenue increase in this product category 

other products 

the decrease in revenue from our other products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from spvss business which we divested on october 28 2018 

service revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

service revenue increased 2  driven by an increase in software and solution support offerings service revenue increased in the americas and emea segments partially offset by decreased revenue in our apjc segment 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 



product gross margin 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2018  to fiscal 2019  



1 productivity includes overall manufacturingrelated costs such as component costs warranty expense provision for inventory freight logistics shipment volume and other items not categorized elsewhere 

product gross margin increased by 12  percentage points driven by productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing and product mix our product gross margin also benefited from the sale of our lower margin spvss business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 

productivity improvements were driven by cost reductions including value engineering efforts eg component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations the negative pricing impact which was lower than the yearoveryear impact we experienced in fiscal 2018 was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets the unfavorable product mix impact was driven by our products within the infrastructure platforms product category our product gross margin also benefited from the 127 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2018 related to legal and indemnification settlements 

service gross margin 

our service gross margin percentage increased by 01  percentage point due to higher sales volume partially offset by increased headcountrelated and delivery costs 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



1 the unallocated corporate items   include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense significant litigation settlements and other contingencies charges related to asset impairments and restructurings and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

we experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our americas segment due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix the unfavorable product mix impact was driven by products within the infrastructure platforms product category our gross margin in this segment also benefited from the sale of our lower margin spvss business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019 

product gross margin in our emea segment increased due to productivity improvements partially offset by negative impacts from pricing and mix 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage decrease was due to negative impacts from pricing partially offset by productivity improvements and favorable product mix lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment 

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment 

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



rd expenses 

rd expenses increased due to higher headcountrelated expenses and to a lesser extent higher acquisitionrelated costs higher contracted services and higher discretionary spending 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses increased due to higher headcountrelated expenses higher discretionary spending and to a lesser extent higher contracted services and higher acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by lower sharebased compensation expense 

ga expenses 

ga expenses decreased due to a benefit from the 400 million litigation settlement with arista networks and lower contracted services partially offset by higher discretionary spending and higher headcountrelated expenses 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2019  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 233 million  or 13  compared with fiscal 2018  in fiscal 2018  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 93 million  or 05  compared with fiscal 2017  

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets in millions 

the decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the purchased intangible assets related to the divestiture of spvss business on october 28 2018 partially offset by amortization from our recent acquisitions 

restructuring and other charges 

the following table presents the restructuring and other charges in millions 

we initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas with estimated pretax charges of 600 million  in connection with this restructuring plan we incurred charges of 322 million  during fiscal 2019 and have incurred cumulative charges of 430 million  we expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in the first half of fiscal 2020 

these charges were primarily cashbased and consisted of employee severance and other onetime termination benefits and other associated costs we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas as a result the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

operating income increased by 16  and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 24  percentage points these increases resulted primarily from a revenue increase a gross margin percentage increase a benefit from the 400 million litigation settlement with arista in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and lower restructuring and other charges 

interest and other income loss net 

interest income expense net   the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



interest income decreased driven by a decrease in the average balance of cash and availableforsale debt investments the decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance partially offset by the impact of higher effective interest rates 

other income loss net     the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 

the total change in net gains losses on availableforsale debt investments was primarily attributable to lower realized losses as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these investments 

the total change in net gains losses on marketable equity investments was attributable to market value fluctuations and the timing of recognition of gains and losses 

the change in net gains losses on nonmarketable equity and other investments was primarily due to lower realized gains partially offset by higher unrealized gains 

the change in other gains losses net was primarily driven by higher donation expense in the prior year 

provision for income taxes 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 202  for fiscal 2019  compared with 992  for fiscal 2018  the net 790  percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the 104 billion mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries foreign withholding tax and dta remeasurement recorded during fiscal 2018 

as a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard on sharebased compensation in fiscal 2018 our effective tax rate will increase or decrease based upon the tax effect of the difference between the sharebased compensation expenses and the benefits taken on the companys tax returns we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and therefore anticipate the effective tax rate to vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 21 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments   the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2018  to fiscal 2019  was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of 207 billion  under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of 60 billion  net cash paid for acquisitions and divestitures of 22 billion  a net decrease in debt of 11 billion  and capital expenditures of 09 billion  these uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 158 billion  and the timing of settlements of investments and other of 20 billion 

in addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business on july 9 2019 we announced our intent to acquire acacia communications inc “acacia” for a purchase consideration of approximately 26 billion  in cash additionally 07 billion  of the us transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries 60 billion  of longterm debt and 42 billion  of commercial paper notes outstanding at july 27 2019 are payable within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date see further discussion of liquidity and future payments under “contractual obligations” and “liquidity and capital resource requirements” below 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our availableforsale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

free cash flow and capital allocation   as part of our capital allocation strategy we intend to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not 

represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other required uses of cash including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors 

on february 13 2019  our board of directors authorized a 15 billion increase to the stock repurchase program the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program including the additional authorization is approximately 135 billion  with no termination date 

accounts receivable net   the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions 



our accounts receivable net as of july 27 2019  decreased by approximately 1  compared with the end of fiscal 2018  

inventory supply chain   the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions 



inventory as of july 27 2019  decreased by 25  from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2018  the decrease in inventory was due primarily to lower deferred cost of sales related to the adoption of asc 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity 

our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure longterm pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts 

the following table summarizes our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers as of the respective period ends in millions 



purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 23  compared to the end of fiscal 2018  on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 24  compared with the end of fiscal 2018  

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees   the following table summarizes our financing receivables in millions 



financing receivables   our financing arrangements include leases loans and financed service contracts lease receivables include salestype and directfinancing leases arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we also provide financing to certain qualified customers for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services the majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed financing receivables increased by 2    we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 

financing guarantees   in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms 

the volume of channel partner financing was 296 billion  282 billion  and 270 billion  in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017  respectively these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was 14 billion  and 10 billion  as of july 27 2019  and july 28 2018  respectively we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed as of july 27 2019  the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately 218 million  of which approximately 77 million  was recorded as deferred revenue 

borrowings 

senior notes   the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 



interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium interest is payable quarterly on the floatingrate notes we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 27 2019  

commercial paper   we have a shortterm debt financing program in which up to 100 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes we had 42 billion  in commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 27 2019  and no commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 28 2018  

credit facility   on may 15 2015 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on may 15 2020 any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or c libor or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the administrative agent “eurocurrency rate” for an interest period of one month plus 100 or ii the eurocurrency rate plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc provided that in no event will the eurocurrency rate be less than zero we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion andor extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to may 15 2022 this credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement as of july 27 2019  we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

deferred revenue   the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



deferred revenue decreased primarily due to the adoption of asc 606 in the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019 of the total deferred revenue decrease related to the adoption of asc 606 of 28 billion 26 billion relates to deferred product revenue and 02 billion relates to deferred service revenue of the adjustment to deferred product revenue 13 billion related to our recurring software and subscription offers 06 billion related to twotier distribution and the remainder related to nonrecurring software and other adjustments the decrease related to the adoption of asc 606 was partially offset by an increase in product deferred revenue during the fiscal year the increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue 

contractual obligations   

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 27 2019  in millions 



operating leases   for more information on our operating leases see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers   we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure longterm pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” as of july 27 2019  the liability for these purchase commitments was 129 million  and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 

other purchase obligations   other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt   the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

transition tax payable  transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the onetime us transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tax act see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities   other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 13 billion and deferred tax liabilities of 95 million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our acquisitions we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our nonmarketable equity and other investments some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 326 million  as of july 27 2019  compared with 223 million  as of july 28 2018  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have nonmarketable equity and other investments and provide financing to certain customers certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our nonmarketable equity and other investments and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 27 2019  there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our nonmarketable equity and other investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt pending acquisitions future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

availableforsale debt investments   we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding availableforsale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our availableforsale debt investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our availableforsale debt investments as of july 27 2019  our availableforsale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading our availableforsale debt investments are not leveraged as of july 27 2019  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our availableforsale debt investments including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points bps plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps   the hypothetical fair values as of july 27 2019  and july 28 2018  are as follows in millions 

  





financing receivables   as of july 27 2019  our financing receivables had a carrying value of 101 billion  compared with 98 billion  as of july 28 2018  as of july 27 2019  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt    as of july 27 2019  we had 205 billion  in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which consisted of 05 billion  in floatingrate notes and 200 billion  in fixedrate notes the carrying amount of the senior notes was 205 billion  and the related fair value based on market prices was 221 billion  as of july 27 2019  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 45 billion  of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 05 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt that is not hedged 

equity price risk 

marketable equity investments   the fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading as of july 27 2019  the total fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities was 3 million  

nonmarketable equity and other investments   these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of july 27 2019  the total carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity and other investments was 12 billion compared with 11 billion at july 28 2018  some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of nonmarketable equity and other investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 

at july 27 2019  and july 28 2018  we had no option contracts outstanding 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2019  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 233 million  or 13  as compared with fiscal 2018  in fiscal 2018  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 93 million  or 05  as compared with fiscal 2017  to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes

strategy and priorities   

as our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises and as more applications move to a multicloud environment we believe the network continues to be extremely critical we believe that our customers are looking for intentbased networks that provide meaningful business value through automation security and analytics across private hybrid and multicloud environments our vision is to deliver highly secure softwaredefined automated and intelligent platforms for our customers our strategic priorities include the following accelerating our pace of innovation increasing the value of the network and transforming our business model   

accelerating pace of innovation — enabling   network automation 

in fiscal 2017 we announced the initial development of new network product offerings that feature our intentbased networking technology the intentbased networking platform is designed to be intelligent highly secure powered by “intent” and informed by “context”—features aiming to constantly learn adapt automate and protect in order to optimize network operations and defend against an evolving cyber threat landscape to further our innovation in this area we are applying the latest technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics to operate and define the network from a security standpoint these new network product offerings are designed to enable customers to detect threats for instance in encrypted traffic and we have created what is in our view the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy 

our catalyst 9000 series of switches represent the initial build of our intentbased networking capabilities and provide highly differentiated advancements in security programmability and performance while lowering operating costs by innovating at the hardware and software layers our intentbased network started with the softwaredefined access sdaccess technology one of our leading enterprise architectures these offerings are designed to provide a single highly secure network fabric that helps ensure policy consistency and network assurance enables faster launches of new business services and significantly improves issue resolution times while being open and extendable sdaccess built on the principles of cisco digital networking architecture dna provides what we see as a transformational shift in the building and managing of networks 

for the data center our application centric infrastructure aci solutions deliver centralized applicationdriven policy automation management and visibility of both physical and virtual environments as a single system 

increasing the value of the network 

unlocking the power of data      our customers are increasingly using technology and specifically networks to grow their businesses drive efficiencies and more effectively compete we believe data is one of an organizations most strategic assets and this data is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem on customer premises at the edge of the network and in the cloud as the number of new devices connected to the internet grows we believe the network will play an even more critical role in enabling our customers to aggregate automate and draw actionable insights from this highly distributed data where there is a premium on security and speed we believe this is driving our customers to adopt entirely new it architectures and organizational structures and more specifically to seek network deployment solutions that deliver greater agility productivity security and other advanced network capabilities 

security is foundational   we believe that security is the top it priority for many of our customers our security strategy is focused on delivering an effective cybersecurity architecture combining network cloud and endpointbased solutions through our industryleading cisco talos offering we intend to protect against and provide security across the entire attack continuum before during and after a cyberattack to help our customers shorten the time between threat detection and response 

powering a multicloud world   our customers are operating in multicloud environments with private public and hybrid clouds our cloud strategy is to deliver solutions designed to simplify secure and transform how customers work in this multicloud world to maximize business outcomes 

as our customers navigate the multicloud world they need to connect new devices protect their assets and monitor cloud consumption and they also require advisory cloud services that are provided in a consistent manner we are focused on enabling simple intelligent automated and highly secure clouds by delivering the infrastructure to navigate the complex it environment through our software and subscriptionbased offerings including webex meraki cloud networking and certain other of our security and applications offerings we believe that customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique recognizing that we offer a solution for all cloud environments including private hybrid and public clouds 

in our view over the next several years customers will be increasingly writing modern applications that can run on any hybrid cloud and will be adding billions of connections to their environment we believe cisco is uniquely positioned to enable successful business outcomes for customers in hybrid and multicloud environments in our view the network has never been more critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms 

transforming our business model 

we are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers as part of the transformation of our business we continued to make strides during fiscal 2018 to develop and sell more software and subscriptionbased offerings which we expect will increase the amount of our recurring revenue the catalyst 9000 series of switches are an example of how we are beginning to shift more of our core business to a subscriptionbased model historically our various networking technology products have aligned with their respective product categories however increasingly our offerings are crossing multiple product categories as our core networking evolves we expect we will add more common software features across our core networking platforms with respect to the disaggregation of hardware and software and how our customers want to consume our technology we are increasing the amount of software offerings that we provide we have various types of software arrangements including system software on premise software hybrid software and saas offerings in terms of monetization our software offerings fall into the broad categories of subscription arrangements and perpetual licenses 

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements

the security product category primarily includes our unified threat management products advanced threat security products and web security products that are designed to provide a highly secure environment for our customers security continues to be the top it priority for many of our customers and we continue to believe that security solutions will help to protect the digital economy we believe that security will be an enabler that helps safeguard our customers’ business interests and can help create competitive advantage for them our approach is designed to provide protection across the entire attack continuum before during and after a cyberattack and to help our customers shorten the time to threat detection and response in our view the escalation of ransomware and other malware events in the past year demonstrates that organizations are more critically exposed than ever 

our security portfolio is designed to increase capability while reducing complexity by delivering simple open and automated solutions resulting in more effective security our security portfolio spans endpoints the network and the cloud our offerings cover the following networkrelated areas network and data center security advanced threat protection web and email security access and policy unified threat management and advisory integration and managed services our offerings are powered by cisco talos our industryleading cloud delivered threat intelligence platform 

in fiscal 2018 we continued to invest in cloud security these investments include introducing our stealthwatch cloud behavioral threat detection for iaas infrastructure as a service and paas platform as a service environments extending our umbrella platform capabilities and providing new functions such as shadow it discovery in cloudlock our casb cloud access security broker solution we significantly extended our endpoint security portfolio advanced malware protection for endpoints with new exploit prevention capabilities for fileless malware we remain focused on delivering an integrated architecture across our security products highlighted by the introduction of cisco visibility a unified threat management platform across many of our products 

other products 

our other products category primarily consists of service provider video software and solutions and cloud and system management products we announced a definitive agreement to sell our service provider video software and solutions business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we expect this transaction to close in the first half of fiscal 2019 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions 

services 

in addition to our product offerings we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers including technical support services and advanced services in fiscal 2019 we introduced customer experience combining our overall service and support offerings into one organization that is responsible for the endtoend customer experience 

technical support services help our customers ensure their products operate efficiently remain available and benefit from the most uptodate system and application software these services help customers protect their network investments manage risk and minimize downtime for systems running missioncritical applications a key example is cisco smart services which leverages the intelligence from the installed base of our products and customer connections to protect and optimize network investment for our customers and partners  we have expanded our technical services offerings from traditional hardware support to software solutions and premium support and outcome based offers 

advanced services are part of a comprehensive program that is focused on providing responsive preventive and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs we are investing in and expanding our advanced services in the areas of cloud security and analytics which reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes we are focused on three priorities including utilizing technology advisory services to drive higher product and services pullthrough assessment and migration services providing the tools expertise and methodologies to enable our customers to migrate to new technology platforms and providing optimization services aligned with customers’ measurable business outcomes 

we believe this strategy along with our architectural approach and networking expertise has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors 

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no  single customer accounted for 10  or more of revenue our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise commercial service provider and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we plan to take advantage of the networkasaplatform strategy to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

commercial 

we define commercial businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1000 employees we sell to the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or organizations with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain we sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners 

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide this customer market category includes regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also include media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks whose requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

public sector 

public sector entities include federal governments state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector entities have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector entities through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as through direct sales 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2018  our worldwide sales and marketing departments consisted of approximately 25200  employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in 96 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors typically hold inventory and sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from twotier distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using point of sales information provided by these distributors starting in fiscal 2019 in connection with the adoption of asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition we will start recognizing revenue from twotier distributors on a sellin method for further discussion of asc 606 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as cyberattacks data protection breaches malware or terrorism may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation and cyberattacks or data protection breaches on our customers networks in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and software maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



product backlog 

our product backlog at july 28 2018  was approximately 66 billion  an increase of 38  year over year the product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status subscriptionbased sales arrangements are not included in product backlog our cycle time between order and shipment is generally short and customers occasionally change delivery schedules additionally orders can be canceled without significant penalties as a result of these factors we do not believe that our product backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as “build buy partner invest and codevelop this fiveprong approach to how we innovate can be summarized as follows 



acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to generate revenue no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies with which we have added or expanded strategic alliances during fiscal 2018 and in recent years include apple google salesforcecom and ericsson among others 

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include amazon web services llc arista networks inc arris group inc check point software technologies ltd dell technologies inc extreme networks inc f5 networks inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard enterprise company huawei technologies co ltd juniper networks inc lenovo group limited microsoft corporation new relic inc nokia corporation nutanix inc palo alto networks inc symantec corporation ubiquiti networks and vmware inc among others   

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance 

partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success   

research and development 

we regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of infrastructure platforms applications security and other product technologies our research and development expenditures were  63 billion  61 billion  and 63 billion  in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of increased focus include our intentbased networking technologies which encompasses switching routing and wireless technologies within infrastructure platforms security and analytics products our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internet working products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost 

management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time defined as less than one year 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses”

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include   



































as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 













the global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the recent united kingdom “brexit” referendum to withdraw from the european union the current economic challenges in china including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition   

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in product orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 in fiscal 2017 and in certain prior periods 

in addition reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect customers’ perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states trust and confidence in us as an it supplier 

is critical to the development and growth of our markets impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas such as security and applications while also focusing on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services however the return on our investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty 

our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and in fiscal 2017 on a yearoveryear basis our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter revenue and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our product gross margins declined on a yearoveryear basis and could decline in future quarters due to adverse impacts from various factors including   



































changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other infrastructure platforms and applications products in addition to longer sales cycles although product orders from the service provider market increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 service provider product orders decreased in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and in fiscal 2017 and at various times in the past we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and as has been the case in the past such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic political or regulatory uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in 

spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is generally recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 









in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas and in key priority and growth areas for example as products related to network programmability such as sdn products become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware referred to as white box hardware to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market 

as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 business  of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors asics offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 



  



















we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need 

to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 







a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand in the industry for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or the reramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future   







manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products many of our strategic initiatives and investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for automating orchestrating integrating and delivering an everincreasing array of itbased products and services for example in june 2017 we announced our catalyst 9000 series of switches which represent the initial foundation of our intentbased networking capabilities other current initiatives include our focus on security the market transition related to digital transformation and iot the transition in cloud and the move towards more programmable flexible and virtual networks 

the process of developing new technology including intentbased networking more programmable flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions— such as security digital transformation and iot and cloud— is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such as for example networking products based on “white box” hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in a timely fashion offerings to address other transitions or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings 

our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions that deliver greater agility productivity security and other advanced network capabilities and that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected over the last few years we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology including changes in our business models with customers if our strategy for addressing our customer needs or the architectures and solutions we develop do not 

meet those needs or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed 

furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction or restructuring costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

we initiated a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service and marketing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas such as security and applications and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platforms and in services we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated market transitions and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance 

of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 















acquisitions may also cause us to   



















mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions see the 

risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence for example as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of 125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widelyused component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products and in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pretax charge of 655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries we also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 in fiscal 2017 and in certain prior periods we continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states including impacts from global central bank monetary policy issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries that can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies 

headquartered in the united states and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following 















we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries 

we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments in the past we may recognize 

in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations see note 12g to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition including net neutrality rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the 

future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to 218 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes 14 billion  for interest and 10 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 28 2018  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements subsection h legal proceedings 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 36 countries including the united states has made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as cyberattacks data protection breaches malware or terrorism may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and financial condition and damage our reputation and cyberattacks or data protection breaches on our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

despite our implementation of network security measures the products and services we sell to customers and our servers data centers and the cloudbased solutions on which our data and data of our customers suppliers and business partners are stored are vulnerable to cyberattacks data protection breaches malware and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or human error any such event could compromise our networks or those of our customers and the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen which could subject us to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance and may not be successful breaches of network security in our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy transportation or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of third party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

the products and services we sell to customers and our cloudbased solutions inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security we may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes which could result in an exploit which compromises security customers also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation in addition we rely on thirdparty providers of software and cloudbased service and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities customers may also not deploy a security release or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products services or cloudbased solutions containing the release leaving them vulnerable vulnerabilities and critical security defects prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects failure of thirdparty providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and in the past have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore 

speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

as of the end of fiscal 2018 we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 258 billion  that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2019 through 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 100 billion  and we had   no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 28 2018  the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually except 10 billion  of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our whollyowned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances

overview 

cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that have been powering the internet since 1984 across networking security collaboration applications and the cloud our evolving intentbased technologies are constantly learning and adapting to provide customers with a highly secure intelligent platform for their digital business   

 a summary of our results is as follows in millions except percentages and pershare amounts 



1   fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results include an 863 million benefit and a 104 billion charge respectively related to the enactment of the tax act 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

in fiscal 2018 we saw broad strength across the business and delivered solid   revenue growth margins cash flow and returns for our shareholders we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities our product revenue reflected growth in infrastructure platforms applications and security and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions we continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment we experienced some weakness in the service provider market and we expect ongoing uncertainty in that area while the overall environment remains uncertain we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term 

total revenue increased by 3  compared with fiscal 2017  within total revenue product and service revenue each increased by 3  total gross margin decreased by 10  percentage points driven primarily by unfavorable impacts from pricing a 127 million legal and indemnification settlement charge and unfavorable product mix partially offset by productivity benefits while productivity was positive to overall product gross margin the benefit was lower than in the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the cost of certain components which are currently constrained as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively were flat operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 01  percentage points diluted earnings per share and net income each decreased by 99  due to the 104 billion provisional tax expense related to the tax act comprised of 81 billion us transition tax 12 billion of foreign withholding tax and 11 billion of net deferred tax assets remeasurement 

in terms of our geographic segments revenue from the americas increased by 07 billion  emea revenue increased by 04 billion  and revenue in our apjc segment increased by 02 billion  these increases reflect broad strength across several countries within these segments the “bricm” countries experienced product revenue growth of 2 in the aggregate driven by increased product revenue in the emerging countries of brazil russia india and china of 17 10 3 and 3 respectively partially offset by a product revenue decline of 16 in mexico 

from a customer market standpoint we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial market and to a lesser extent in the enterprise and public sector markets product revenue in the service provider market declined with ongoing uncertainty in that area 

from a product category perspective the product revenue increase of 3  was driven by a 2  product revenue increase in infrastructure platforms and solid product revenue growth in applications and security of 10  and 9  respectively we saw broad strength across the portfolio with the exception of routing related to the weakness in the service provider market 

fourth quarter snapshot 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  total revenue increased by 6  within total revenue product revenue increased by 7  and service revenue increased by 3  with regard to our geographic segment performance on a yearoveryear basis revenue in the americas emea and apjc increased by 5  8  and 6  respectively from a product category perspective we experienced broad strength across the portfolio total gross margin decreased by 05  percentage points driven by some specific transactions with service providers in our apjc segment our gross margin also decreased due to unfavorable pricing product mix and higher component costs partially offset by improved productivity benefits as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 03  percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 11  percentage points diluted earnings per share increased by 69  and net income increased by 57  due in part to an 863 million tax benefit related to the tax act

for a full discussion of our strategy and priorities see item 1 business 

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2018  compared with fiscal 2017  in millions 



critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met when a sale involves multiple deliverables such as sales of products that include services the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met for hosting arrangements we recognize revenue ratably over the hosting period while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term 

the amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and if so our valuation of the units of accounting our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  deliverables within the scope of asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition  or a combination of both according to the accounting guidance prescribed in asc 605 we use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those units when available we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately 80 of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15 of the median rates when vsoe does not exist we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multipledeliverable arrangements under the selling price hierarchy thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of others in our markets and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers in determining esp we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors based on the characteristics of the deliverable we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering companyspecific factors such as geographies competitive landscape internal costs profitability objectives pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 

as our business and offerings evolve over time our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly which could result in changes in selling prices including both vsoe and esp in subsequent periods there were no material impacts during fiscal 2018 from changes in vsoe tpe or esp 

we make sales to distributors which we refer to as twotier sales to the end customer revenue from twotier distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using pointofsale information provided by these distributors distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition asc 606 will supersede nearly all us gaap on revenue recognition and eliminate industryspecific guidance the underlying principle of the new standard is to recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services at an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services it also requires increased disclosures including the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows related to contracts with customers 

asc 606 allows two methods of adoption i retrospectively to each prior period presented “full retrospective method” or ii retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized in retained earnings as of the date of adoption “modified retrospective method” we will adopt the new standard using the modified retrospective method at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2019 

we do not expect that asc 606 will have a material impact on total revenue for fiscal 2019 based on two factors i revenue will be accelerated consistent with the changes in timing as indicated in the table in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements largely offset by ii the reduction of revenue from software arrangements where revenue was previously deferred in prior periods and recognized ratably over time as required under the current standard this preliminary assessment is based on the types and number of revenue arrangements currently in place the exact impact of asc 606 will be dependent on facts and circumstances at adoption and could vary from quarter to quarter 

for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we expect that the adoption of asc 606 may increase total revenue by about 1 on a yearoveryear basis for further discussion of asc 606 including the estimated impacts on transition date see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

allowances for receivables and sales returns 

the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions except percentages 



1   calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates which are published by major thirdparty creditrating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts if a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis we consider historical experience credit quality and age of receivable balances and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis we use expected default frequency rates published by a major thirdparty creditrating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation are complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our operating results both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 

a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates the reserve for future sales returns as of july 28 2018  and july 29 2017  was 123 million  and 122 million  respectively and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory 

our provision for inventory was 63 million  74 million  and 65 million  in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016  respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 105 million  124 million  and 134 million  in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016  respectively if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments 

loss contingencies and product warranties 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 

if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our profitability could be adversely affected 

fair value measurements 

our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities collectively are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of 376 billion  as of july 28 2018  compared with 588 billion  as of july 29 2017  our fixed income investment portfolio as of july 28 2018  consisted primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments it encompasses three classes of investments level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and modelderived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 

our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data we use inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities we use such pricing data as the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2018 and 2017  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 

the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 28 2018    

otherthantemporary impairments 

we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these securities to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected we consider all available information including past events current conditions the remaining payment terms of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of underlying collateral 

for publicly traded equity securities we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

we also have investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages as of july 28 2018  our investments in privately held companies were 1096 million  compared with 983 million  as of july 29 2017  and were included in other assets we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 28 2018  and july 29 2017  was 317 billion  and 298 billion  respectively the increase in goodwill during fiscal 2018  was due in large part to our acquisition of broadsoft in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016  for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2018  the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 730 billion for the americas 530 billion for emea and 355 billion for apjc 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were 1 million  47 million  and 74 million  during fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016  respectively our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits domestic manufacturing deductions tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 992  218  and 169  in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016  respectively 

on december 22 2017 the tax act was enacted the tax act significantly revises the us corporate income tax by among other things lowering the statutory corporate income tax rate “federal tax rate” from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a fiscalyear taxpayer certain provisions of the tax act impact us in fiscal 2018 including the change in the federal tax rate and the onetime transition tax while other provisions will be effective at the beginning of fiscal 2019 including the implementation of a modified territorial tax system and other changes to how foreign earnings are subject to us tax and elimination of the domestic manufacturing deduction 

as a result of the decrease in the federal tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 we have computed our income tax expense for the july 28 2018 fiscal year using a blended federal tax rate of 27 the 21 federal tax rate will apply to our fiscal year ending july 27 2019 and each year thereafter we must remeasure our dta using the federal tax rate that will apply when the related temporary differences are expected to reverse 

in december 2017 the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 which addresses how a company recognizes provisional estimates when it does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed including computations in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the effect of the changes in the tax act the measurement period ends when a company has obtained prepared and analyzed the information necessary to finalize its accounting but cannot extend beyond one year the final impact of the tax act may differ from the provisional estimates due to changes in interpretations of the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act by changes in accounting standard for income taxes and related interpretations in response to the tax act and any updates or changes to estimates used in the provisional amounts we have determined that the 81 billion  of tax expense for the us transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries the 12 billion  of foreign withholding tax and the 11 billion  of tax expense for dta remeasurement were each provisional amounts and reasonable estimates for fiscal 2018  estimates used in the provisional amounts include the anticipated reversal pattern of the gross dtas and earnings cash positions foreign taxes and withholding taxes attributable to foreign subsidiaries 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income and the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 36 countries including the united states has made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

results of operations 

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our service provider video connected devices business “sp video cpe business” sp video cpe business revenue was 504 million  for fiscal 2016 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017   

total revenue increased by 3  product and service revenue each increased by 3  our total revenue reflected growth across each of our geographic segments product revenue for the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced 2 product revenue growth with increases in brazil russia india and china partially offset by a decrease in mexico 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multipleelement arrangements the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment as has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time customers require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support and these activities may occur in future periods which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016   

total revenue decreased by 3 total company revenue not including sp video cpe products decreased 2 product revenue decreased by 4 while service revenue increased by 3 fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016 thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less extra week we estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately 265 million 200 million of which was from our services subscriptions and 65 million from our saas offerings such as webex and a small amount from product distribution our total revenue declined in the americas and emea geographic segments while revenue grew in our apjc geographic segment the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced a 7 product revenue decline with revenue declines in mexico china and brazil partially offset by increases in the other two bricm countries

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the 5  decrease in product revenue in the americas segment was driven by declines in the service provider public sector and commercial markets product revenue in the enterprise market was flat the product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in large part by the absence of product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2017 we had 378 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2016 in this segment the product revenue decline in the public sector market was due primarily to lower sales to state and local governments and to the us federal government from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 5 in the united states 28 in mexico and 7 in brazil partially offset by an increase of 2 in canada 

emea 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

the increase in product revenue in the emea segment of 3  was driven by solid growth in the commercial and public sector markets and to a lesser extent growth in the enterprise market these increases were partially offset by a product revenue decline in the service provider market product revenue from emerging countries within emea and the remainder of the emea segment which primarily consists of countries in western europe each increased by 3 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

product revenue in the emea segment decreased by 3 driven by a decline in the service provider market and to a lesser extent declines in the public sector and enterprise markets product revenue in the commercial market was flat the product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in part by the absence of product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2017 we had 108 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2016 in this segment product revenue from emerging countries within emea and product revenue for the remainder of the emea segment each decreased by 3

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

product revenue in the apjc segment decreased by 1  the product revenue decrease was led by declines in the service provider and public sector markets partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market product revenue in the enterprise market was flat from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 12 in china driven by a decrease in sales of service provider video software and solutions products while product revenue increased by 11 in india 9 in australia and 2 in japan product sales for this geographic segment were adversely impacted by an 18 million decrease in product sales related to the absence of our sp video cpe business 

product revenue by groups of similar products 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we began reporting our product revenue in the following categories infrastructure platforms applications security and other products this change better aligns our product categories with our evolving business model prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation 

the following table presents revenue for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

infrastructure platforms 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

the infrastructure platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching routing wireless and the data center infrastructure platforms revenue increased by 2  or 491 million  with strength across the portfolio with the exception of routing switching experienced growth with solid revenue growth in data center switching driven by an increase in sales of cisco nexus 9000 series products and with revenue growth in campus switching driven by our intentbased networking cisco catalyst 9000 series data center had strong double digit growth driven by higher sales of server products and our hyperconverged data center offering hyperflex we also experienced solid revenue growth from wireless products driven by meraki as well as our wave 2 offerings we had a decrease in sales of routing products driven by continued weakness in the service provider market 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

revenue from the infrastructure platforms product category decreased by 4  or 1072 million  driven primarily by lower revenue from switching products within switching we experienced a decrease in sales of switching products used in campus environments which we believe was driven both by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending as well as by a highly competitive landscape these impacts were partially offset by an increase in sales of our aci portfolio which is included in our data center switching portfolio we also experienced a decrease in revenue from routing products driven by weakness in enterprise access and a decrease in revenue from data center due to lower sales of server products we had revenue growth from wireless products driven by meraki 

applications 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

the applications product category includes our collaboration offerings unified communications cisco telepresence and conferencing as well as the internet of things iot and analytics software offerings from jasper and appdynamics respectively revenue in our applications product category increased by 10  or 467 million  with growth across all of the businesses we experienced solid growth in the telepresence unified communications conferencing and analytics from our fiscal 2017 acquisition of appdynamics we continued to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our applications product category 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the increase in revenue in our applications product category by 3  or 130 million  was in large part due to increased revenue from our iot software offerings driven by our fiscal 2016 jasper acquisition the growth in conferencing revenue and the acquisition of appdynamics in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 also contributed to the revenue increase in this product category these increases in revenue were partially offset by decreased revenue from unified communications and telepresence 

security 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

revenue in our security product category increased 9  or 200 million  driven by higher sales of unified threat management web security policy and access and advanced threat products we continued to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our security product category 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

revenue in our security product category increased 9  or 184 million  driven by higher sales of unified threat management advanced threat security and web security products 

other products 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

the decrease in revenue from our other products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from service provider video software and solutions “spvss” 

on may 1 2018 we announced a definitive agreement to sell the spvss business we expect this transaction to close in the first half of fiscal 2019 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the decrease in revenue in our other products category was in large part due to a decrease in product sales of 504 million related to our sp video cpe business and a decrease in revenue from spvss products 

service revenue by segment

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

service revenue increased across all geographic segments technical support services revenue increased by 2 and advanced services revenue increased by 4 technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments the increase in technical support services revenue was driven by an increase in software and solution support offerings advanced services revenue which relates to professional services for specific customer network needs had solid growth in the emea segment and to a lesser extent increased in our americas and apjc segments 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

service revenue grew 3 excluding the 200 million of additional revenue as a result of the extra week in fiscal 2016 service revenue grew 4 service revenue grew across all of our geographic segments technical support services revenue increased by 3 and advanced services revenue increased by 1 technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments the increase in technical support services revenue was driven by contract initiations and renewals associated with product sales and an increase in software support offerings advanced services revenue had solid revenue growth in our apjc segment declined slightly in our emea segment and was flat in our americas segment 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 



product gross margin 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2017  to fiscal 2018  



1 productivity includes overall manufacturingrelated costs such as component costs warranty expense provision for inventory freight logistics shipment volume and other items not categorized elsewhere 

product gross margin decreased by 09  percentage points due largely to unfavorable impacts from product pricing a charge of 127 million to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2018 related to legal and indemnification settlements and unfavorable product mix partially offset by productivity benefits 

the negative pricing impact which was lower than the yearoveryear impact we experienced in fiscal 2017 was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets while productivity was positive to overall product gross margin the benefit was lower than the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the costs of certain components which are currently constrained we expect the higher component costs to continue to impact productivity in the near term productivity improvements were driven by cost reductions including value engineering efforts eg component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations the decrease in product gross margin was also due to an unfavorable mix of products sold driven by negative mix impacts from our infrastructure platforms products partially offset by favorability from security applications and other products our product gross margin in fiscal 2018 was also negatively impacted by higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2016  to fiscal 2017  



product gross margin decreased by 04 percentage points as compared with fiscal 2016 the decrease in product gross margin was largely due to unfavorable impacts from product pricing lower productivity benefits and unfavorable product mix partially offset by a benefit from the divestiture of the lower margin sp video cpe business in fiscal 2016 

the negative pricing impact was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets while productivity was positive to overall product gross margin the benefit was lower than the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the cost of certain memory components in addition productivity was negatively impacted by decreases in core routing and switching revenue which limited our ability to generate cost savings productivity improvements were driven by value engineering efforts eg component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations the decrease in product gross margin was also due to an unfavorable mix of products sold driven by negative mix impacts from our infrastructure platform products 

service gross margin 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

our service gross margin percentage decreased by 08  percentage points due to increased headcountrelated costs and to a lesser extent unfavorable mix and increased delivery costs these cost impacts were partially offset by the resulting benefit to gross margin of higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

our service gross margin percentage increased by 12 percentage points due to higher sales volume decreased delivery costs favorable mix and to a lesser extent lower sharebased compensation expense these benefits to service gross margin were partially offset by increased headcountrelated costs 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding 

1   the unallocated corporate items   include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense significant litigation settlements and other contingencies charges related to asset impairments and restructurings and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

we experienced a slight gross margin percentage increase in our americas segment due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix the unfavorable mix of products sold in this segment was driven by negative mix impacts from our infrastructure platforms products partially offset by favorability from security applications and other products 

the gross margin percentage decrease in our emea segment was due primarily to negative impacts from pricing and to a lesser extent an unfavorable product mix partially offset by productivity improvements lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage decreased due primarily to the negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix partially offset by productivity improvements lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this geographic segment our gross margin in this segment was also negatively impacted by specific transactions with service providers 

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decrease due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix partially offset by productivity improvements and the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business the unfavorable mix impact was driven by infrastructure platforms products 

the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was due primarily to higher service gross margin product gross margin in this segment also increased slightly due to the impact of productivity improvements the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business and a favorable product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage increased due primarily to higher service gross margin product gross margin in this segment decreased due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix partially offset by productivity improvements the unfavorable mix impact was driven by infrastructure platforms products 

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



our fiscal 2016 had an extra week compared with fiscal 2017 we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately 116 million of the yearoveryear decrease in total operating expenses not including sharebased compensation expense 

rd expenses 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

rd expenses increased primarily due to higher headcountrelated expenses higher discretionary spending and to a lesser extent higher acquisitionrelated costs and higher sharebased compensation expense partially offset by lower contracted services 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

rd expenses decreased primarily due to lower contracted services lower headcountrelated expenses lower discretionary spending and lower acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by higher sharebased compensation expense lower headcount related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions and the extra week in fiscal 2016 

sales and marketing expenses 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

sales and marketing expenses increased due to increases in headcountrelated expenses discretionary spending sharebased compensation expense and acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by a decrease in contracted services 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

sales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower headcountrelated expenses lower contracted services lower discretionary spending lower acquisitionrelated costs and to a lesser extent lower sharebased compensation expense lower headcountrelated expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions the extra week in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease in headcountrelated expenses 

ga expenses 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

ga expenses increased due to increases in contracted services headcountrelated expenses discretionary spending acquisitionrelateddivestiture costs and sharebased compensation expense partially offset by gains on divestitures 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

ga expenses increased primarily due to the 253 million pretax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business recorded during fiscal 2016 and to a lesser extent higher sharebased compensation expense these increases were partially offset by lower headcountrelated expenses and lower contracted services the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the decreased headcountrelated expense 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2018  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 93 million  or 05  compared with fiscal 2017  in fiscal 2017  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 77 million  or 04  compared with fiscal 2016  

sharebased compensation expense 

the following table presents sharebased compensation expense in millions 



fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

the increase in sharebased compensation expense was due primarily to higher expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the increase in sharebased compensation expense was due primarily to higher expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets in millions 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

amortization of purchased intangible assets increased slightly as amortization from our recent acquisitions was partially offset by decreases related to spvss purchased intangibles which were held for sale and lower impairment charges in fiscal 2018 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized and lower impairment charges in fiscal 2017 partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions 

restructuring and other charges 

the following table presents the restructuring and other charges in millions 

we initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2018 in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas with estimated pretax charges of approximately 300 million  we expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2019 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

we incurred restructuring and other charges of 358 million  during fiscal 2018 108 million  of which was related to the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2018 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced in august 2016 

we incurred restructuring and other charges of 756 million  and 266 million  during fiscal 2017 and 2016 respectively in connection with the restructuring plans announced in august 2016 and august 2014 

these charges were primarily cashbased and consisted of employee severance and other onetime termination benefits and other associated costs we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas as a result the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

operating income increased by 3  and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 01  percentage points these increases resulted primarily from an increase in revenue and a decrease in restructuring and other charges 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

operating income decreased by 5 and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 08 percentage points these decreases resulted primarily from an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in august 2016 and the 253 million pretax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business recorded in fiscal 2016 

interest and other income loss net 

interest income expense net   the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

interest income increased driven by higher yields on our portfolio the increase in interest expense was driven by the impact of higher effective interest rates 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

interest income increased driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio the increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances which includes commercial paper notes and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floatingrate senior notes and interest rate swaps associated with fixedrate senior notes 

other income loss net     the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

the change in total net gains losses on availableforsale investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains on publicly traded equity securities and lower impairment charges on publicly traded equity securities partially offset by higher realized losses on fixed income securities as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities 

the change in net gains losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to lower impairment charges partially offset by lower realized gains on investments in privately held companies 

the change in other gains losses net was primarily driven by higher donation expense net unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and impacts from equity derivatives 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the change in total net gains losses on availableforsale investments was driven by 74 million of impairment charges on publicly traded equity securities 

the change in net gains losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher impairment charges on investments in privately held companies partially offset by higher realized gains on investments in privately held companies 

the change in other gains losses net was driven by lower donation expense partially offset by impacts from customer lease terminations foreign exchange and equity derivatives 

provision for income taxes 

fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 992  for fiscal 2018  compared with 218  for fiscal 2017  the net 774  percentage point increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the mandatory onetime transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries foreign withholding tax and dta remeasurement during fiscal 2018  

during fiscal 2018 we recorded a provisional tax expense of 104 billion related to the tax act comprised of 81 billion of us transition tax 12 billion of foreign withholding tax and 11 billion remeasurement of net dta we plan to pay the transition tax in installments over eight years in accordance with the tax act the tax act is discussed more fully in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

as a result of the adoption of the new accounting standard on sharebased compensation in fiscal 2018 our effective tax rate will increase or decrease based upon the tax effect of the difference between the sharebased compensation expenses and the benefits taken on the companys tax returns we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis and therefore anticipate the effective tax rate to vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 27 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 218  for fiscal 2017  compared with 169  for fiscal 2016  the net 49  percentage point increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of a net benefit to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 related to our settlement with the irs of all outstanding items covering fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and reinstatement of the us federal rd tax credit on december 18 2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments   the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2017  to fiscal 2018  was primarily driven by cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of 175 billion  under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of 60 billion  net decrease in debt of 80 billion  net cash paid for acquisitions of 30 billion  the timing of settlements of investments and other of 20 billion and capital expenditures of 08 billion  these uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of 137 billion  

in fiscal 2018 we repatriated 70 billion of foreign subsidiary earnings to the us in the form of cash cash equivalents or investments and paid foreign withholding tax of 12 billion we also paid approximately 125 million of other onetime foreign taxes as a result of the tax act future repatriation of cash and other property held by our foreign subsidiaries will generally not be subject to us federal tax as we evaluate the impact of the tax act and the future cash needs of our global operations we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries 

in addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business on august 2 2018 we announced our intent to acquire duo security inc for a purchase consideration of approximately 235 billion  in cash and assumed equity awards see further discussion of liquidity and future payments under “contractual obligations” and “liquidity and capital resource requirements” below 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

free cash flow and capital allocation   as part of our capital allocation strategy we intend to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other required uses of cash including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors 

on february 14 2018  our board of directors authorized a 25 billion increase to the stock repurchase program the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program including the additional authorization is approximately 190 billion  with no termination date we expect to utilize this remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases over the next 12 to 18 months 

the purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to shareholders’ equity we are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as i a reduction to retained earnings and ii a reduction of common stock and additional paidin capital as a result of future stock repurchases we may report an accumulated deficit in future periods in shareholders’ equity 

accounts receivable net   the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions 



our accounts receivable net as of july 28 2018  increased by approximately 8  compared with the end of fiscal 2017  primarily due to higher product billings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018  compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  

inventory supply chain   the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions 



inventory as of july 28 2018  increased by 14  from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2017  the increase in inventory was due to an increase in raw materials due to securing memory supply which is currently constrained and also higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity 

our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers manufactured finished goods consist primarily of buildtoorder and buildtostock products 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity 

our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure longterm pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts the following table summarizes our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers as of the respective period ends in millions 



purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 40  compared to the end of fiscal 2017  on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 33  compared with the end of fiscal 2017  

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees   the following table summarizes our financing receivables in millions 



financing receivables   our financing arrangements include leases loans and financed service contracts lease receivables include salestype and directfinancing leases arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we also provide financing to certain qualified customers for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services the majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed financing receivables increased by 2    we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 

financing guarantees   in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms 

the volume of channel partner financing was 282 billion  270 billion  and 269 billion  in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016  respectively these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was 953 million  and 10 billion  as of july 28 2018  and july 29 2017  respectively we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed as of july 28 2018  the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately 308 million  of which approximately 122 million  was recorded as deferred revenue 

borrowings 

senior notes   the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 



interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium interest is payable quarterly on the floatingrate notes we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 28 2018  

commercial paper   we have a shortterm debt financing program in which up to 100 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes we had no commercial paper notes and 32 billion  in commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 28 2018  and july 29 2017  respectively 

credit facility   on may 15 2015 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on may 15 2020 any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or c libor or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the administrative agent “eurocurrency rate” for an interest period of one month plus 100 or ii the eurocurrency rate plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc provided that in no event will the eurocurrency rate be less than zero we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion andor extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to may 15 2022 this credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement as of july 28 2018  we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

deferred revenue   the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



total deferred revenue increased 6  in fiscal 2018  deferred product revenue increased 15  primarily due to product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers which grew 23 on a yearoveryear basis to 61 billion  deferred service revenue increased 1  driven by the impact of contract renewals partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue 

contractual obligations   

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 28 2018  in millions 



operating leases   for more information on our operating leases see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers   we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure longterm pricing for certain product components for multiyear periods a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” as of july 28 2018  the liability for these purchase commitments was 159 million  and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 

other purchase obligations   other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt   the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

transition tax payable   in connection with the tax act we recorded an income tax payable of 81 billion for the us transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounts associated with the tax act are considered provisional and may be subject to further adjustment during the measurement period see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities   other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 1278 million and deferred tax liabilities of 141 million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our acquisitions we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 223 million  as of july 28 2018  compared with 216 million  as of july 29 2017  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have investments in privately held companies including venture funds and provide financing to certain customers certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 28 2018  there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt pending acquisitions future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities   we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july 28 2018  our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july 28 2018  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps   the hypothetical fair values as of july 28 2018  and july 29 2017  are as follows in millions 

  





financing receivables   as of july 28 2018  our financing receivables had a carrying value of 98 billion  compared with 96 billion  as of july 29 2017  as of july 28 2018  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt     as of july 28 2018  we had 258 billion  in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which consisted of 10 billion  in floatingrate notes and 248 billion  in fixedrate notes the carrying amount of the senior notes was 256 billion  and the related fair value based on market prices was 264 billion  as of july 28 2018  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 68 billion  of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 05 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt that is not hedged 

equity price risk 

the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard  poor’s 500 index or nasdaq composite index these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

publicly traded equity securities   the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio excluding hedged equity securities if any potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 20 and 30 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices 

the hypothetical fair values as of july 28 2018  and july 29 2017  are as follows in millions 





investments in privately held companies   we have also invested in privately held companies these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method as of july 28 2018  the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 1096 million  compared with 983 million  at july 29 2017  some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2018  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 93 million  or 05  as compared with fiscal 2017  in fiscal 2017  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 77 million  or 04  as compared with fiscal 2016  to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes

strategy and priorities   

as our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises we believe the network is becoming more critical than ever we believe that our customers are looking for intelligent networks that provide meaningful business value through automation security and analytics our vision is to deliver a highly secure intelligent platform for digital businesses our strategic priorities include accelerating our pace of innovation increasing the value of the network and delivering technology the way our customers want to consume it   

accelerating innovation — enabling   network automation 

in june 2017 we announced the initial development of new network product offerings that feature what we refer to as “intuitive” networking technology the intuitive network is an intentbased networking platform designed to be intelligent highly secure powered by “intent” and informed by “context”—features by which the intuitive network aims to constantly learn adapt automate and protect in order to optimize network operations and defend against an evolving cyber threat landscape to further our innovation in this area we are applying the latest technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics to operate and define the network from a security standpoint these new product network offerings are designed to enable customers to detect threats in encrypted traffic and we have created what is in our view the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy 

our new catalyst 9000 series of switches represent the initial foundation of our intentbased networking capabilities and provide highly differentiated advancements in security programmability and performance while lowering operating costs by innovating at the hardware and software layer these network switches form the foundation for cisco’s softwaredefined access sdaccess technology one of our leading enterprise architectures these offerings are designed to provide a single highly secure network fabric that helps ensure policy consistency enables faster launches of new business services and significantly improves issue resolution times while being open and extendable sdaccess built on the principles of cisco digital networking architecture dna provides what we see as a transformational shift in the building and managing of networks 

we have also been focusing on furthering our innovation with respect to the move toward more programmable flexible and virtual networks sometimes called softwaredefined networking sdn this transition is focused on providing a virtualized network environment that is designed to enable flexible applicationdriven customization of network infrastructures our application centric infrastructure aci solutions deliver centralized applicationdriven policy automation management and visibility of both physical and virtual environments as a single system 

increasing the value of the network 

unlocking the power of data      we believe the growth of intelligent networks and intentbased networks illustrate the increasing value of the network our customers are increasingly using technology and specifically networks to grow their businesses drive efficiencies and more effectively compete we believe data is one of an organizations most strategic assets and this data is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem on customer premises at the edge of the network and in the cloud as the number of new devices connected to the internet grows we believe the network will play an even more critical role in enabling our customers to aggregate automate and draw actionable insights from this highly distributed data where there is a premium on security and speed we believe this is driving our customers to adopt entirely new it architectures and organizational structures and more specifically to seek network deployment solutions that deliver greater agility productivity security and other advanced network capabilities 

deploy security everywhere   we believe that security is the top it priority for many of our customers our security strategy is focused on delivering a unified threatcentric security architecture combining network cloud and endpointbased solutions through this approach we intend to provide security across the entire attack continuum before during and after a cyberattack to help our customers shorten the time between threat detection and response

we believe this strategy along with our architectural approach and networking expertise has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors 

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no  single customer accounted for 10  or more of revenue our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise commercial service provider and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we plan to take advantage of the networkasaplatform strategy to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

commercial 

we define commercial businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1000 employees we sell to the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or organizations with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain we sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners 

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide this customer market category includes regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also include media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our routing and switching optical security video mobility and network management products systems and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks whose requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

public sector 

public sector entities include federal governments state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector entities have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector entities through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as through direct sales 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2017  our worldwide sales and marketing departments consisted of approximately 24500  employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in 95 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors typically hold inventory and sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from twotier distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using point of sales information provided by these distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and software maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



product backlog 

our product backlog at july 29 2017  was approximately 48 billion  an increase of 3  year over year the product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status subscriptionbased sales arrangements are not included in product backlog our cycle time between order and shipment is generally short and customers occasionally change delivery schedules additionally orders can be canceled without significant penalties as a result of these factors we do not believe that our product backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as “build buy partner invest and codevelop this fiveprong approach to how we innovate can be summarized as follows 



acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to generate revenue no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies with which we have or recently had strategic alliances include the following 

accenture ltd apple inc att inc cap gemini sa citrix systems inc dell technologies inc lm ericsson telephone company fujitsu limited inspur group ltd intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa johnson controls inc microsoft corporation netapp inc optum oracle corporation red hat inc sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy services ltd vmware inc wipro limited and others   

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include amazon web services llc arista networks inc arris group inc check point software technologies ltd dell technologies inc extreme networks inc f5 networks inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard enterprise company huawei technologies co ltd juniper networks inc lenovo group limited microsoft corporation new relic inc nokia corporation nutanix inc palo alto networks inc symantec corporation ubiquiti networks and vmware inc among others   

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple 

previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success   

research and development 

we regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of switching ngn routing collaboration data center wireless security service provider video and other product technologies our research and development expenditures were  61 billion  63 billion  and 62 billion  in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of increased focus include but are not limited to our core routing and switching products security wireless collaboration analytics and iot products our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internet working products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are 

designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time defined as less than one year 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses”

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include   



































as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 













the global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the recent united kingdom “brexit” referendum to withdraw from the european union the current economic challenges in china including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition   

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in product orders during fiscal 2017 and certain prior periods 

in addition reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect customers’ perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states trust and confidence in us as an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory actions taken in response 

to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in routing switching and services and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas such as security iot collaboration next generation data center cloud and software while also focusing on maintaining leadership in routing switching and services however the return on our investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty 

our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in fiscal 2017 on a yearoveryear basis our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter revenue and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our product gross margins declined in fiscal 2017 and in certain other prior periods and could decline in future quarters due to adverse impacts from various factors including   



































changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as data center collaboration and service provider video in addition to longer sales cycles product orders from the service provider market decreased in fiscal 2017 and at various times in the past we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and as has been the case in the past such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic political or regulatory uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business 

and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is generally recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 









in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in key priority and growth areas for example as products related to network programmability such as sdn products become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware referred to as white box hardware to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market 

as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 business  of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly 

formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors asics offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 



  



















we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts 

in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 







a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand in the industry for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or the reramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future   







manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products many of our strategic initiatives and investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for automating orchestrating integrating and delivering an everincreasing array of itbased products and services for example in june 2017 we announced our catalyst 9000 series of switches which represent the initial foundation of our intentbased networking capabilities other current initiatives include our focus on security the market transition related to digital transformation and iot the transition in cloud and the move towards more programmable flexible and virtual networks 

the process of developing new technology including intentbased networking more programmable flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions— such as security digital transformation and iot and cloud— is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such as for example networking products based on “white box” hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in a timely fashion offerings to address other transitions or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours in addition our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings 

our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions that deliver greater agility productivity security and other advanced network capabilities and that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected over the last few years we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology including changes in our business models with customers if our strategy for addressing our customer needs or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed 

furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market 

share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction or restructuring costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

in august 2016 we announced a restructuring plan under which we began taking action in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 in may 2017 we extended the restructuring plan to include additional employees the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service and marketing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas such as security iot collaboration next generation data center cloud and software and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in routing switching and services we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated market transitions and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 















acquisitions may also cause us to   



















mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to 

existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence for example as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of 125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widelyused component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products and in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pretax charge of 655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries we also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders during fiscal 2017 and certain prior periods we continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states including impacts from global central bank monetary policy issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries that can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have a material adverse effect 

on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following 















we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries 

we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and 

interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations see note 12g to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against 

infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition including net neutrality rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept 

positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to 258 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes 15 billion  for interest and 12 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 29 2017  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 35 countries including the united states has recently made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as cyberattacks data protection breaches computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and damage our reputation and cyberattacks or data protection breaches on our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

despite our implementation of network security measures the products and services we sell to customers and our servers data centers and the cloudbased solutions on which our data and data of our customers suppliers and business partners are stored are vulnerable to cyberattacks data protection breaches computer viruses and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or human error any such event could compromise our networks or those of our customers and the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen which could subject us to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and could have a material adverse effect   on our business operating results and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance and may not be successful breaches of network security in our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services could result in liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy transportation or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and in the past have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

as of the end of fiscal 2017 we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 305 billion  that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2018 through 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 100 billion  and we had   32 billion  commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 29 2017  the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually except 29 billion  of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our whollyowned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances

brazil     brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in addition to claims asserted by the brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years tax authorities from the brazilian state of sao paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years 

the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities that remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to 258 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes 15 billion  for interest and 12 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 29 2017  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years 

sri international     on september 4 2013 sri international inc “sri” asserted patent infringement claims against us in the us district court for the district of delaware accusing our products and services in the area of network intrusion detection of infringing two us patents sri sought monetary damages of at least a reasonable royalty and enhanced damages the trial on these claims began on may 2 2016 and on may 12 2016 the jury returned a verdict finding willful infringement of the asserted patents the jury awarded sri damages of 237 million on may 25 2017 the court awarded sri enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees entered judgment in the new amount of 570 million and ordered an ongoing royalty of 35 through the expiration of the patents in 2018 we have appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit on various grounds we believe we have strong arguments to overturn the jury verdict andor reduce the damages award while the ultimate outcome of the case may still result in a loss we do not expect it to be material

overview 

cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that have been powering the internet since 1984 across networking security collaboration and the cloud our evolving intentbased technologies are constantly learning and adapting to provide customers with a highly secure intelligent platform for their digital business 

 a summary of our results is as follows in millions except percentages and pershare amounts 



1  during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of the customer premises equipment portion of our service provider video connected devices business “sp video cpe business” as a result revenue from this portion of the service provider video product category will not recur in future periods the year ended july 30 2016  included sp video cpe business revenue of 504 million  

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016—financial performance 

in fiscal 2017 we delivered solid profitability and strong operating cash flows we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities we continue to operate in a challenging and highly competitive environment which has impacted in particular our ngn routing and switching areas we saw weakness in the service provider customer market and we expect ongoing uncertainty in that area in addition we continued to see weakness in emerging countries in the aggregate we experienced solid revenue growth in security and wireless and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions which is part of our strategy while the overall environment remains uncertain we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas to drive profitable growth over the long term 

total revenue decreased by 3  compared with fiscal 2016  within total revenue product revenue decreased 4  while service revenue increased by 3  in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of our sp video cpe business total company revenue for fiscal 2017 decreased 2 not including revenue from sp video cpe products for fiscal 2016 additionally fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016 thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less week compared with fiscal 2016 we estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately 265 million total gross margin increased by 01  percentage points as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 01  percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 08  percentage points driven primarily by an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in august 2016 diluted earnings per share decreased by 10  driven by an 11  decrease in net income net income was impacted by a higher effective tax rate as compared with fiscal 2016 primarily due to the recognition of 448 million of net benefits to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 these benefits were comprised of a settlement with the irs of outstanding items related to the audit of our federal income tax returns covering the period from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and the permanent reinstatement of the us federal rd tax credit 

in terms of our geographic segments revenue from the americas decreased 10 billion  driven in large part by lower product revenue in the unites states emea revenue decreased by 03 billion  led by a product revenue decline in the united kingdom revenue in our apjc segment increased by 01 billion  led by service revenue growth in this segment we saw revenue declines in many emerging countries across the world during fiscal 2017 the “bricm” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 7 in the aggregate driven by declines in the emerging countries of mexico china and brazil of 28 12 and 7 respectively partially offset by increased product revenue in russia and india of 20 and 11 respectively 

from a customer market standpoint we experienced product revenue declines in the service provider and the public sector markets and to a lesser extent in the commercial market product revenue in the enterprise market was flat the decline in the service provider market was driven in part by the sale of the sp video cpe business as well as ongoing weakness in the service provider market 

from a product category perspective total company product revenue decreased 4  this decrease was led by product revenue decreases in switching and ngn routing of 5  and 4  respectively the decline in sales of our switching products was primarily due to lower sales of switches used in campus environments which comprise the majority of our switching portfolio we believe the decline in sales of switching products used in campus environments was driven both by uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending as well as by a highly competitive landscape product revenue from service provider video data center and collaboration decreased by 45  4  and 2  respectively partially offsetting these decreases was product revenue growth in security and wireless which grew by 9  and 5  respectively 

fourth quarter snapshot 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  total revenue decreased by 4  within the total revenue product revenue decreased 5  while service revenue increased by 1  with regard to our geographic segment performance on a yearoveryear basis revenue in the americas and emea each decreased by 6  while apjc had revenue growth of 6  from a product category perspective total product revenue decrease was driven by revenue decreases from switching and ngn routing products with each decreasing 9 year over year total gross margin decreased by 09  percentage points as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 07  percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 11  percentage points diluted earnings per share decreased by 14  from the prior year primarily as a result of a 14  decrease in net income

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2017  compared with fiscal 2016  in millions except annualized inventory turns 



critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met when a sale involves multiple deliverables such as sales of products that include services the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met for hosting arrangements we recognize revenue ratably over the hosting period while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term 

the amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and if so our valuation of the units of accounting our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  deliverables within the scope of asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition  or a combination of both according to the accounting guidance prescribed in asc 605 we use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those units when available we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately 80 of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15 of the median rates when vsoe does not exist we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multipledeliverable arrangements under the selling price hierarchy thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of others in our markets and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers in determining esp we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors based on the characteristics of the deliverable we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering companyspecific factors such as geographies competitive landscape internal costs profitability objectives pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 

as our business and offerings evolve over time our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly which could result in changes in selling prices including both vsoe and esp in subsequent periods there were no material impacts during fiscal 2017  nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe tpe or esp 

we make sales to distributors which we refer to as twotier sales to the end customer revenue from twotier distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using pointofsale information provided by these distributors distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

allowances for receivables and sales returns 

the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions except percentages 



1   calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates which are published by major thirdparty creditrating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts if a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis we consider historical experience credit quality and age of receivable balances and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis we use expected default frequency rates published by a major thirdparty creditrating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation are complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our operating results both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 

a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates the reserve for future sales returns as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  was 122 million  and 126 million  respectively and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory as of july 29 2017  the liability for these purchase commitments was 162 million  compared with 159 million  as of july 30 2016  and was included in other current liabilities 

our provision for inventory was 74 million  65 million  and 54 million  in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015  respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 124 million  134 million  and 102 million  in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015  respectively if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast 

loss contingencies and product warranties 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

in fiscal 2014 we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of 655 million resulting from failures related to products containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 we perform regular assessments of the sufficiency of this liability and reduced the amount by 74 million and 164 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively based on updated analyses during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we further reduced the liability by 141 million  to reflect lower than expected defects actual usage history and estimated lower future remediation costs as more of the impacted products age and near the end of the support period covered by the remediation program in addition during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a 125 million  charge to product cost of sales related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widelyused component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products the liabilities related to the supplier component remediation matters as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  was 174 million  and 276 million  respectively 

estimating these liabilities is complex and subjective and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected our estimated liabilities for these matters may be impacted 

our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 

if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our profitability could be adversely affected 

fair value measurements 

our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities collectively are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of 588 billion  as of july 29 2017  compared with 581 billion  as of july 30 2016  our fixed income investment portfolio as of july 29 2017  consisted primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments it encompasses three classes of investments level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and modelderived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 

our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data we use inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities we use such pricing data as the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2017 and 2016  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 

the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 29 2017    level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  

otherthantemporary impairments 

we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these securities to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected we consider all available information including past events current conditions the remaining payment terms of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of underlying collateral 

for publicly traded equity securities we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

we also have investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages as of july 29 2017  our investments in privately held companies were 983 million  compared with 1003 million  as of july 30 2016  and were included in other assets we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  was 298 billion  and 266 billion  respectively the increase in goodwill during fiscal 2017  was due in large part to our acquisition of appdynamics in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015  for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2017  the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was   468 billion for the americas 251 billion for emea and 209 billion for apjc 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were 47 million  74 million  and 175 million  during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015  respectively our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits domestic manufacturing deductions tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 218  169  and 198  in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015  respectively 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 35 countries including the united states has recently made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

results of operations 

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016   

total revenue decreased by 3  total company revenue not including sp video cpe products decreased 2 product revenue decreased by 4  while service revenue increased by 3  fiscal 2017 had 52 weeks compared with 53 weeks in fiscal 2016 thus our results for fiscal 2017 reflect one less extra week we estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately 265 million 200 million of which was from our services subscriptions and 65 million from our saas offerings such as webex and a small amount from product distribution our total revenue declined in the americas and emea geographic segments while revenue grew in our apjc geographic segment the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced a 7 product revenue decline with revenue declines in mexico china and brazil partially offset by increases in the other two bricm countries 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multipleelement arrangements the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment as has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time customers require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support and these activities may occur in future periods which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015   

total revenue was flat total company revenue not including sp video cpe products increased 3 product revenue decreased by 1 in total but increased by 2 for product revenue not including sp video cpe products service revenue increased by 5 fiscal 2016 had 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2015 thus our results for fiscal 2016 reflect an extra week the impact of which is discussed above our total revenue grew in our apjc geographic segment while revenue declined in the americas and emea geographic segments the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced 3 product revenue growth with growth in china india and mexico partially offset by decreases in the other two bricm countries our revenue in fiscal 2016 was adversely affected by the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the us dollar and especially currencies in certain emerging countries although the indirect effects are difficult to measure 

product revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of our sp video cpe business   as a result revenue from this portion of the service provider video product category will not recur in future periods sp video cpe business revenue was 504 million  and 1846 million  for fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively 

americas 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the 5  decrease in product revenue in the americas segment was driven by declines in the service provider public sector and commercial markets product revenue in the enterprise market was flat the product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in large part by the absence of product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2017 we had 378 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2016 in this segment the product revenue decline in the public sector market was due primarily to lower sales to state and local governments and to the us federal government from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 5 in the united states 28 in mexico and 7 in brazil partially offset by an increase of 2 in canada 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the decrease in product revenue for the americas segment was driven by a decline of 1146 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business product revenue not including sp video cpe products increased for the americas segment from a customer markets perspective the decrease in product revenue in the americas segment of 3  was led by a significant decline in the service provider market driven by the sale of the sp video cpe business we experienced product revenue growth in the commercial public sector and enterprise markets the product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to state and local governments partially offset by lower sales to the us federal government   from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 34 in brazil and 24 in canada partially offset by a slight increase in the united states and an increase of 3 in mexico 

emea 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

product revenue in the emea segment decreased by 3  driven by a decline in the service provider market and to a lesser extent declines in the public sector and enterprise markets product revenue in the commercial market was flat the product revenue decrease in the service provider market was driven in part by the absence of product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2017 we had 108 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business in fiscal 2016 in this segment product revenue from emerging countries within emea and product revenue for the remainder of the emea segment each decreased by 3 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the decrease in product revenue of 2  or 200 million  for the emea segment was driven by a decline of 164 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business from a customer market perspective the decrease was driven by product revenue declines in the service provider public sector and enterprise markets partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market the decline in sales to the service provider market was due primarily to the sale of the sp video cpe business product revenue from emerging countries within emea decreased by 11 led by a decline in russia of 31 product revenue for the remainder of the emea segment which primarily consists of countries in western europe increased by 1 

apjc 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

product revenue in the apjc segment decreased by 1  the product revenue decrease was led by declines in the service provider and public sector markets partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market product revenue in the enterprise market was flat from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 12 in china driven by a decrease in sales of service provider video software and solutions products while product revenue increased by 11 in india 9 in australia and 2 in japan product sales for this geographic segment were adversely impacted by an 18 million decrease in product sales related to the absence of our sp video cpe business 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the increase in product revenue in the apjc segment of 5  was led by solid growth in the service provider market and to a lesser extent growth in the enterprise public sector and commercial markets from a country perspective product revenue increased by 22 in china driven by an increase in sales of service provider video software and solutions products and 18 in india partially offset by product revenue decreases of 7 in japan and 5 in australia product revenue for this geographic segment was adversely impacted by a 32 million decrease in product revenue related to the sale of our sp video cpe business 

product revenue by groups of similar products 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes our product categories consist of the following categories switching ngn routing collaboration data center wireless security service provider video and other products 

the following table presents revenue for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 



1  during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of the sp video cpe business as a result fiscal 2016 includes only four months of product revenue from sp video cpe business sp video cpe business revenue was 504 million  and 1846 million  for fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively 

certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period’s presentation

the decrease in revenue in our switching product category of 5  or 751 million  was driven primarily by a decrease in sales of switching products used in campus environments which comprise the majority of our switching portfolio we believe this was driven both by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending as well as by a highly competitive landscape these impacts were partially offset by an increase in sales of our aci portfolio which is included in our data center switching portfolio 

in terms of subcategories the decrease in revenue from our modular switches of 18 or 784 million and the decrease in sales of storage products of 22 or 95 million were partially offset by increased revenue from our lan fixedconfiguration switches of 1 or 128 million revenue from our modular switches decreased driven by lower sales of most of the cisco catalyst series switches and cisco nexus 7000 series switches partially offset by growth in cisco nexus 9500 series switches within this product category revenue from lan fixedconfiguration switches increased due to higher sales of our cisco nexus 9300 series switches cisco catalyst 3650 series switches and cisco catalyst 3850 series switches partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

we believe the flat revenue in our switching product category was driven in large part by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending this led to flat revenue in our switching products used in campus environments which comprise the majority of revenue within this product category we also experienced decreased revenue from storage products 

these impacts were offset by an increase in sales of our switching products used in data centers reflecting strength in our aci portfolio 

in terms of subcategories the increase in revenue from lan fixedconfiguration switches of 5 or 452 million was substantially offset by decreased revenue from our modular switches of 8 or 375 million and the decreased revenue from storage products of 17 or 89 million revenue from our lanfixed configuration switches increased due primarily to higher sales of our cisco catalyst 3850 series switches cisco catalyst 3650 series switches cisco nexus 9300 series switches and cisco nexus 3000 series switches partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio decreased revenue from our modular switches was due primarily to lower sales of most of our cisco catalyst series switches and also due to lower sales of our cisco nexus 7000 series switches partially offset by sales growth in cisco nexus 9500 series switches within this product category 

ngn routing 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

revenue in our ngn routing product category decreased by 4  or 302 million  driven by an 8 or 211 million decrease in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products and a 5 or 208 million decrease in revenue from our highend router products these declines were partially offset by a 10 or 117 million increase in revenue from other ngn routing products revenue from our midrange and lowend router products decreased due to lower sales of our cisco isr products and certain of our access router products the decrease in revenue from highend router products was driven by a decrease in revenue from our mobility products within our asrs and from our crs products revenue from other ngn routing products increased due to higher sales of cable access products and certain optical networking products 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

we believe a cautious service provider capital expenditure spending environment negatively impacted sales in ngn routing revenue in this product category decreased by 3  or 210 million  driven by an 8 or 378 million decrease in revenue from our highend router products partially offset by a 12 or 126 million increase in revenue from what we categorize as other ngn routing products and a 2 or 42 million increase in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products revenue from highend router products decreased due to a decrease in revenue from most of our highend router products partially offset by higher sales of our crsx products revenue from other ngn routing products increased due to higher sales of optical networking products the revenue increase in the midrange and lowend routers was primarily driven by higher sales of cisco isr products 

collaboration 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

revenue from our collaboration product category decreased by 2  or 74 million  driven by a decrease in sales of cisco unified communications and cisco telepresence products partially offset by continued growth in conferencing revenue the decrease in unified communications revenue was driven primarily by decreased revenue from phones revenue from cisco telepresence products declined due to lower revenue from endpoint products the growth in conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring saas revenue from webex which we include as product revenue in this category we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our collaboration product category 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

revenue from our collaboration product category increased by 9  or 348 million  driven by growth across the various subcategories within this product category the growth in conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring revenue from webex revenue from cisco telepresence products grew due to higher revenue in infrastructure and endpoint products as a result of new product introductions the increase in unified communications revenue was driven by higher software revenue 

data center 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

revenue in our data center product category decreased by 4  or 137 million  driven by a decrease in sales of our cisco unified computing system products with declines in the commercial enterprise and public sector markets partially offset by growth in the service provider market we believe that both the uncertainty in the macro environment and the continued market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rackbased systems continued to affect customer spending the decrease in sales of our cisco unified computing system products was partially offset by an increase in sales of our hyperconverged offering hyperflex 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the increase in revenue in our data center product category of 5  or 146 million  was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our cisco unified computing system products with growth across all geographic segments and most of the customer markets we believe the uncertainty in the macro environment led to a slowdown of customer spending for products in this category and we are seeing a market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rackbased systems 

wireless 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

revenue in our wireless product category increased by 5  or 126 million  due primarily to continued growth in sales of meraki products within this product category and an increase in sales of certain of our access point products partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controller products we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our wireless product category 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

revenue in our wireless product category increased by 3  or 89 million  due primarily to continued growth in sales of meraki products within this category partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controllers products 

security 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

revenue in our security product category increased 9  or 184 million  driven by higher sales of unified threat management products advanced threat security products and web security products we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our security product category 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

revenue in our security product category increased 13  or 222 million  driven by higher sales of advanced threat security web security and unified threat management products 

service provider video 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the decrease in revenue from our service provider video product category of 45  or 788 million  was driven by a decrease in product sales of 504 million  related to our sp video cpe business and a decrease in revenue from our video software and solutions products particularly in china 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the decrease in revenue from our service provider video product category of 41  or 1207 million  was driven by a decrease in product sales of 1342 million related to our sp video cpe business which we sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from certain cable access products and an increase in revenue from our video software and solutions products particularly in china 

other products 

the increase in revenue in our other products category for fiscal 2017 was in large part due to increased revenue from our iot products driven by our fiscal 2016 jasper acquisition the acquisition of appdynamics in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 also contributed to the increase in revenue in this product category the increase in revenue for fiscal 2016 was due to increased revenue from data and analytics offerings from our cloudrelated offerings and from our iot products driven by our jasper acquisition 

service revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

service revenue grew 3  excluding the 200 million of additional revenue as a result of the extra week in fiscal 2016 service revenue grew 4 service revenue grew across all of our geographic segments technical support services revenue increased by 3 and advanced services revenue increased by 1 technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments the increase in technical support services revenue was driven by contract initiations and renewals associated with product sales and an increase in software support offerings advanced services revenue which relates to professional services for specific customer network needs had solid revenue growth in our apjc segment declined slightly in our emea segment and was flat in our americas segment 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

service revenue grew 5  which includes a 200 million or 2 yearoveryear increase as a result of the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 service revenue had solid growth across all of our geographic segments technical support services revenue increased by 5 and advanced services revenue increased by 7 technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which in concert with new service offerings were the primary factors driving the revenue increases advanced services revenue grew across all geographic segments 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 



product gross margin 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2016  to fiscal 2017  



1 productivity includes overall manufacturingrelated costs such as component costs warranty expense provision for inventory freight logistics shipment volume and other items not categorized elsewhere 

product gross margin decreased by 04  percentage points as compared with fiscal 2016  the decrease in product gross margin was largely due to unfavorable impacts from product pricing lower productivity benefits and unfavorable product mix partially offset by a benefit from the divestiture of the lower margin sp video cpe business in fiscal 2016 

the negative pricing impact was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets while productivity was positive to overall product gross margin the benefit was lower than the prior year as these improvements were adversely impacted by an increase in the cost of certain memory components which are currently constrained we expect the higher costs related to the constraint on these memory components to continue to impact productivity in the near term in addition productivity was negatively impacted by decreases in core routing and switching revenue which limited our ability to generate cost savings productivity improvements were driven by value engineering efforts eg component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes lower warranty expenses and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations the decrease in product gross margin was also due to an unfavorable mix of products sold driven by negative mix impacts from our ngn routing switching and iot products 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2016  



product gross margin increased by 27  percentage points compared with fiscal 2015  the increase in product gross margin was due in large part to productivity improvements which were driven primarily by value engineering efforts favorable component pricing and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations our product gross margin also benefited from the sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 of our lower margin sp video cpe business lower amortization expense and impairment charges related to acquisitionrelated intangible assets and a 188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the rockstar consortium patent portfolio 

the various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets an unfavorable mix of products sold and the lower supplier component remediation adjustment the unfavorable mix of products sold was due to a negative mix impact from our cisco unified computing system products higher sales of service provider video products not including the cpe business and an unfavorable mix within switching products 

service gross margin 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

our service gross margin percentage increased by 12  percentage points due to higher sales volume decreased delivery costs favorable mix and to a lesser extent lower sharebased compensation expense these benefits to service gross margin were partially offset by increased headcountrelated costs 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

service gross margin percentage increased by 16  percentage points due to higher sales volume and decreased headcountrelated costs these benefits to gross margin were partially offset by increased partner delivery costs and increased outside services costs 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



1   the unallocated corporate items   include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense significant litigation and other contingencies charges related to asset impairments and restructurings and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decrease due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix partially offset by productivity improvements and the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business the unfavorable mix impact was driven by ngn routing switching and iot products 

the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was due primarily to higher service gross margin product gross margin in this segment also increased slightly due to the impact of productivity improvements the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business and a favorable product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage increased due primarily to higher service gross margin product gross margin in this segment decreased due to negative impacts from pricing and product mix partially offset by productivity improvements the unfavorable mix impact was driven by our cisco unified computing system products 

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the americas segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase due primarily to the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business in this geographic segment productivity improvements were substantially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix the unfavorable mix of products sold was due to increased revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products and an unfavorable mix within our ngn routing products 

the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was due primarily to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment and the sale of the sp video cpe business partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix the unfavorable mix of products sold was due primarily to increased revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the overall gross margin in this geographic segment 

our apjc segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix the mix impact was driven primarily by higher sales from our service provider video products not including the sp video cpe business and unfavorable mix within our ngn routing products 

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



our fiscal 2017 had one less week compared with fiscal 2016 which had an extra week we estimate that the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed approximately 116 million of the yearoveryear decrease in total operating expenses not including sharebased compensation expense 

rd expenses 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

rd expenses decreased primarily due to lower contracted services lower headcountrelated expenses lower discretionary spending and lower acquisitionrelated costs partially offset by higher sharebased compensation expense lower headcount related expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions and the extra week in fiscal 2016 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

rd expenses increased primarily due to higher headcountrelated expenses attributable in part to the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and to a lesser extent higher sharebased compensation expense these increases were partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated costs and lower discretionary spending 

sales and marketing expenses 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

sales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower headcountrelated expenses lower contracted services lower discretionary spending lower acquisitionrelated costs and to a lesser extent lower sharebased compensation expense lower headcountrelated expenses were due to efficiencies related to our restructuring actions the extra week in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease in headcountrelated expenses 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

sales and marketing expenses decreased due to lower discretionary spending and lower headcountrelated expenses the aforementioned items benefited from foreign exchange rates during fiscal 2016 lower sharebased compensation expense also contributed to the decrease 

ga expenses 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

ga expenses increased primarily due to the 253 million  pretax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business recorded during fiscal 2016 and to a lesser extent higher sharebased compensation expense these increases were partially offset by lower headcountrelated expenses and lower contracted services the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the decreased headcountrelated expense 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

ga expenses decreased primarily due to the 253 million  pretax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business and to a lesser extent lower contracted services and lower sharebased compensation expense partially offset by higher headcountrelated expenses the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the increased headcountrelated expenses 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2017  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 77 million  or 04  compared with fiscal 2016  in fiscal 2016  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 567 million  or 31  compared with fiscal 2015  

sharebased compensation expense 

the following table presents sharebased compensation expense in millions 



the increase in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2017  as compared with fiscal 2016  was due primarily to higher expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions 

the increase in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  was due primarily to the timing of restricted stock unit rsu grants and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 partially offset by lower net expense associated with accelerated and modified awards 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets in millions 

amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2017  as compared with fiscal 2016  due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized and lower impairment charges in fiscal 2017 partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions 

amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions lower impairment charges in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease 

restructuring and other charges 

in august 2016 we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6600  employees with estimated pretax charges of approximately 850 million  in connection with this restructuring plan we incurred charges of 756 million  during fiscal 2017 these charges were related primarily to severance and other onetime termination benefits and other associated costs we expect the restructuring action to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring action in our key priority areas such as security iot collaboration next generation data center and cloud as a result the overall cost savings from the restructuring action are not expected to be material for future periods 

in connection with a restructuring action announced in august 2014 we incurred restructuring and other charges of 267 million and 489 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively these charges were related primarily to severance and other onetime termination benefits and other associated costs we completed this plan at the end of fiscal 2016   

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

for fiscal 2017  as compared with fiscal 2016  operating income decreased by 5  and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 08  percentage points these decreases resulted primarily from an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in august 2016 and the 253 million  pretax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business recorded in fiscal 2016 

for fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  operating income increased by 18  and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 38  percentage points the increase resulted from the following a gross margin percentage increase driven in part by the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business during fiscal 2016 the 253 million  pretax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business and a decrease in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in august 2014 

interest and other income loss net 

interest income expense net   the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

interest income increased driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio the increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances which includes commercial paper notes and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floatingrate senior notes and interest rate swaps associated with fixedrate senior notes 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

interest income increased driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio of cash and investments the increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floatingrate senior notes and interest rate swaps associated with fixedrate senior notes 

other income loss net     the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the change in total net gains losses on availableforsale investments was driven by 74 million of impairment charges on publicly traded equity securities 

the change in net gains losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher impairment charges on investments in privately held companies partially offset by higher realized gains on investments in privately held companies 

the change in other gains losses net was driven by lower donation expense partially offset by impacts from customer lease terminations foreign exchange and equity derivatives 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the change in total net gains losses on availableforsale investments was primarily attributable to lower realized gains on publicly traded equity securities and net losses on fixed income securities in fiscal 2016 compared to net gains in fiscal 2015 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities 

the change in net gains losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to a gain of 126 million related to the reorganization of our investment in vce which was recorded in fiscal 2015 

the change in other gains losses net was driven by higher donation expenses and net unfavorable foreign exchange impacts partially offset by higher gains from customer lease terminations 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

fiscal 2017 compared with fiscal 2016 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 218  for fiscal 2017  compared with 169  for fiscal 2016  the net 49  percentage point increase in the effective tax rates was primarily due to the recognition of a net benefit to the provision for income taxes in fiscal 2016 related to our settlement with the irs of all outstanding items covering fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010 and reinstatement of the us federal rd tax credit on december 18 2015 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 169  for fiscal 2016  compared with 198  for fiscal 2015  the net 29  percentage point decrease in the effective tax rates was primarily due to a nonrecurring net tax benefit of 367 million or 28 percentage points related to a tax settlement with the irs in fiscal 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments   the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2016  to fiscal 2017  was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of 139 billion  and a net increase in debt of 53 billion  these sources of cash were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends of 55 billion  and repurchases of common stock of 37 billion  under the stock repurchase program net cash paid for acquisitions of 33 billion  the timing of settlements of investments and other of 11 billion and capital expenditures of 10 billion  

our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was 675 billion  and 598 billion  as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  respectively under current tax laws and regulations if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes the balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the united states as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  was 30 billion  and 59 billion  respectively 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

free cash flow and capital allocation     as part of our capital allocation strategy we intend to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue excess tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other required uses of cash including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors 

accounts receivable net the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions 



our accounts receivable net as of july 29 2017  decreased by approximately 12  compared with the end of fiscal 2016  primarily due to service and product billings being more linear in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 

inventory supply chain   the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions except annualized inventory turns 



inventory as of july 29 2017  increased by 33  from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2016  and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 19  on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 22  compared with the end of fiscal 2016  the increase in inventory was due to an increase in raw materials due to securing memory supply which is currently constrained and higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity the increase in purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due to securing memory supply and procuring key components for specific product areas we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts 

our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers manufactured finished goods consist primarily of buildtoorder and buildtostock products 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees   the following table summarizes our financing receivables in millions 



financing receivables   our financing arrangements include leases loans and financed service contracts lease receivables include salestype and directfinancing leases arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets our loan receivables include customers financing purchases of our hardware software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we also provide financing to certain qualified customers for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services the majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed financing receivables increased by 14  primarily due to a 33  increase in loan receivables driven by an increase in financing for software arrangements   we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 

financing guarantees   in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms 

the volume of channel partner financing was 270 billion  269 billion  and 259 billion  in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015  respectively these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was 10 billion  and 11 billion  as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  respectively we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed as of july 29 2017  the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately 314 million  of which approximately 134 million  was recorded as deferred revenue 

borrowings 

senior notes   the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 



1 in march 2017 we repaid senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of 415 billion  upon maturity 

2 in september 2016 we issued senior notes for an aggregate principal amount of 625 billion 

interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium interest is payable quarterly on the floatingrate notes we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 29 2017  

commercial paper   effective march 31 2017 we increased our borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program from 30 billion to 100 billion we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes we had 32 billion  and no commercial paper notes outstanding as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  respectively 

credit facilities   on may 15 2015 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on may 15 2020 any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or c libor or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the administrative agent “eurocurrency rate” for an interest period of one month plus 100 or ii the eurocurrency rate plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc provided that in no event will the eurocurrency rate be less than zero we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion andor extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to may 15 2022 

in addition on march 30 2017 we entered into a 364day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 20 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on march 29 2018 the credit agreement also provides us the option to for a fee convert any borrowings outstanding thereunder on march 29 2018 to a term loan maturing no later than march 29 2019 the interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the credit agreement will be based on either i the higher of a the rates on overnight federal funds transactions with members of the federal reserve system ie federal funds rate plus 050 b bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or c libor for an interest period of one month plus 100 or ii libor plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by sp global rating a business unit of standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc 

these credit agreements require that we comply with certain covenants including that we maintain interest coverage ratios as defined in these agreements as of july 29 2017  we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratios and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under these credit facilities 

deferred revenue   the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



total deferred revenue increased 12  in fiscal 2017  deferred product revenue increased 23  primarily due to increased deferrals related to recurring software and subscription offers the portion of product deferred revenue related to recurring software and subscription offers grew 50 to 50 billion  as of july 29 2017  wireless security and collaboration were the key product category contributors to this product deferred revenue growth during the fiscal year deferred service revenue increased 6  driven by the timing and amount of multiyear arrangements and our focus on contract renewals and service contract attach rates 

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 29 2017  in millions 



operating leases   for more information on our operating leases see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers   we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” as of july 29 2017  the liability for these purchase commitments was 162 million  and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 

other purchase obligations   other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt   the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities   other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 1250 million  and deferred tax liabilities of 271 million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our acquisitions we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

insieme networks inc    in fiscal 2012 we made an investment in insieme an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market this investment included 100 million  of funding and a license to certain of our technology during fiscal 2014 we acquired the remaining interests in insieme at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments which were determined using agreedupon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of insieme’s products the former noncontrolling interest holders earned the maximum amount related to these two milestone payments and were paid approximately 441 million  and 389 million  during fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  respectively during fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015  we recorded compensation expense of 47 million  160 million  and 207 million  respectively related to these milestone payments we do not expect a material amount of future compensation expense or further milestone payments related to this acquisition 

other funding commitments   we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 216 million  as of july 29 2017  compared with 222 million  as of july 30 2016  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have investments in privately held companies including venture funds and provide financing to certain customers certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 29 2017  there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

securities lending 

we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis the average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2017  and 2016 was 07 billion  and 06 billion  respectively we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  we had no outstanding securities lending transactions we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt pending acquisitions future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities   we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july 29 2017  our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july 29 2017  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps due to the low interest rate environment at the end of fiscal 2016  we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 bps or minus 150 bps was relevant the hypothetical fair values as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  are as follows in millions 

  





financing receivables   as of july 29 2017  our financing receivables had a carrying value of 96 billion  compared with 84 billion  as of july 30 2016  as of july 29 2017  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt     as of july 29 2017  we had 305 billion  in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which consisted of 29 billion  floatingrate notes and 276 billion  fixedrate notes the carrying amount of the senior notes was 305 billion  and the related fair value based on market prices was 321 billion  as of july 29 2017  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 68 billion  of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 06 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt that is not hedged 

equity price risk 

the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard  poor’s 500 index or nasdaq composite index these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

publicly traded equity securities   the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio excluding hedged equity securities if any potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 20 and 30 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of july 29 2017  and july 30 2016  are as follows in millions 





investments in privately held companies   we have also invested in privately held companies these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method as of july 29 2017  the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 983 million  compared with 1003 million  at july 30 2016  some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2017  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 77 million  or 04  as compared with fiscal 2016  in fiscal 2016  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 567 million  or 31  as compared with fiscal 2015  to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes

strategy and focus areas 

we see our customers increasingly using technology and specifically networks to grow their businesses drive efficiencies and try to gain a competitive advantage in this increasingly digital world we believe data is the most strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem on customer premises at the edge of the network and in the cloud the network also plays an increasingly important role enabling our customers to aggregate automate and draw insights from this highly distributed data where there is a premium on security and speed we believe this is driving them to adopt entirely new it architectures and organizational structures we understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve and our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive industryleading security that intelligently connects nearly everything that can be digitally connected 

to deliver on our strategy we are focused on providing highly secure automated and intelligent solutions built on infrastructure that connects highly distributed data that is globally dispersed across organizations together with our ecosystem of partners and developers we will provide technology services and solutions we believe will enable our customers to gain insight and advantage from this distributed data with scale security and agility   

over the last several years we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized how we sell our products and how we build and deliver our technology 

we have begun aggressively transitioning our portfolio to enable delivery both on premise and through the cloud in alignment with our strategy to shift to a business model based on more recurring revenue we plan to expand the approach we have taken with our cloudnetworking platforms to an increasing portion of our product and service portfolio to accelerate our shift to a more subscription and softwarebased model 

our approach is to continue to lead the market transitions in our core markets and enter new markets where the network is foundational we continue to drive product transitions including the introduction of nextgeneration products that offer in our view better priceperformance and architectural advantages compared with both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors 

we also plan to continue to deliver innovation across our portfolio in order to sustain our leadership and strategic position with customers we intend to execute on this strategy through portfolio transformation internal innovation acquisition of strategic assets investments in startup companies and codevelopment of products with our customers and the building of strategic partnerships 

market transitions 

we seek to capitalize on market transitions as sources of future opportunities as part of the continued transformation of our business and we believe market transitions in the it industry are occurring with greater frequency market transitions relating to the network are becoming in our view more significant as intelligent networks have moved from being a cost center issue—where the focus is on reducing network operating costs and increasing networkrelated productivity—to becoming a platform for revenue generation business agility and competitive advantage some examples of significant market transitions are as follows 

security    we believe that security is the top it priority for many of our customers in an evolving dynamic threat landscape the most effective way to address security challenges is with continuous threat protection that is pervasive and integrated we further believe that security solutions will help to protect the digital economy and will be an enabler that safeguards business interests protects customers and creates competitive advantage our security strategy is focused on delivering a unified threatcentric security architecture combining networkbased cloudbased and endpointbased solutions providing our customers both more effective security outcomes and a secure foundation to digitize their assets we have invested in security through a build buy and partner strategy to provide security across the entire attack continuum before during and after a cyber attack 

digital transformation      countries cities industries and businesses are pursuing digital transformation which we define as the application of technology to build new business models processes software and systems to capitalize on new digital ways of doing business digital transformation is made possible by the convergence of people businesses and things we believe these types of transformations create opportunities to deliver better customer experiences create new revenue streams through business model transformation and optimize efficiency through workforce innovation 

as our customers move from traditional to digital businesses our goal is to be a strategic partner by providing a technology foundation for digital transformation our offerings for this opportunity incorporate a portfolio of products and services outcomeoriented digital solutions a developerrich environment and a partner ecosystem that integrate connectivity security automation collaboration and analytics across customers business valuechains 

in our view we are delivering the architectural approach and solutionbased results to help customers reduce complexity accelerate and grow and manage risk in a world that is increasingly virtualized applicationcentric cloudbased analyticsdriven and mobile an example of this is our fiscal 2016 acquisition of jasper technologies inc jasper the developer of a cloudbased internet of things iot services platform designed to help enterprises and service providers to launch manage and monetize iot services on a global scale 

softwaredefined networking     we are focusing on a market transition involving the move toward more programmable flexible and virtual networks sometimes called softwaredefined networking sdn this transition is focused on providing a virtualized network environment that is designed to enable flexible applicationdriven customization of network infrastructures we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine applicationspecific integrated circuits asics with hardware and software elements together to meet customers’ total cost of ownership quality security scalability and experience requirements in our view there is no single architecture that supports all customer requirements in this area 

we believe the opportunity of sdn is to enable more open and programmable network infrastructure we are addressing this opportunity with a unique strategy and set of solutions designed to respond automatically to the needs of our customers mission critical applications we introduced and began shipping our application centric infrastructure aci which delivers centralized applicationdriven policy automation management and visibility of both physical and virtual environments as a single system aci is comprised of our nexus 9000 portfolio of switches enhanced versions of our nxos operating system and the application policy infrastructure controller apic which provides a central place to configure automate and manage an entire network based on the needs of applications 

cloud      our cloud strategy is to connect private and public clouds working across hypervisors which are software programs used to create and manage virtual environments we utilize openstack which is an open source computing platform to deliver integrated hybridcloud solutions we believe cloud infrastructures need to be secure and support a rich ecosystem of networkenabled applications to deliver the data and analytics that support the digitization of our customers environments as part of our cloud strategy we are delivering infrastructure and our cloudbased softwareasaservice saas offerings including webex meraki cloud networking and certain other of our security and collaboration offerings 

we believe that customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique recognizing that we offer a solution to different cloud environments including private hybrid and public clouds that enables them to move their workloads across heterogeneous private and public clouds with the necessary policy security and management features 

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

products and services 

our current offerings fall into several categories 

switching 

switching is an integral networking technology used in campuses branch offices and data centers switches are used within buildings in localarea networks lans and across great distances in widearea networks wans our switching products offer many forms of connectivity to end users workstations ip phones wireless access points and servers and also function as aggregators on lans and wans our switching systems employ several widely used technologies including ethernet power over ethernet poe fibre channel over ethernet fcoe packet over synchronous optical network and multiprotocol label switching many of our switches are designed to support an integrated set of advanced services allowing organizations to be more efficient by using one switch for multiple networking functions rather than multiple switches to accomplish the same functions 

key product platforms within our switching product category in which we also include storage products are as follows 



fixedconfiguration switches   are designed to cover a range of deployments in both large enterprises as well as in small and mediumsized businesses providing a foundation for converged data voice and video services our fixedconfiguration switches range from small standalone switches to stackable models that function as a single scalable switching unit 

modular switches are typically used by enterprise and service provider customers with largescale network needs these products are designed to offer customers the flexibility and scalability to deploy numerous as well as advanced networking services without degrading overall network performance 

fixedconfiguration and modular switches also include products such as optics modules which are shared across multiple product platforms our switching portfolio also includes virtual switches and related offerings these products provide switching functionality for virtual machines and are designed to operate in a complementary fashion with virtual services to optimize security and application behavior 

in fiscal 2014 we introduced what we call our application centric infrastructure aci solution which is part of our data center switching portfolio cisco aci consists of the cisco nexus 9000 series switches a cisco apic and accompanying centralized policy management capability integrated physical and virtual infrastructure and an open ecosystem of network storage management and orchestration vendors during fiscal 2016 we have seen strong adoption of cisco aci across geographies and customer segments

the advanced services program supports networking devices applications solutions and complete infrastructures our service and support strategy is focused on capitalizing on increased globalization we believe this strategy along with our architectural approach and networking expertise has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors 

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no  single customer accounted for 10  or more of revenue our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise commercial service provider and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we plan to take advantage of the networkasaplatform strategy to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

commercial 

we define commercial businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1000 employees we sell to the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or organizations with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain we sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners 

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide this customer market category includes regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also include media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased services contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our routing and switching optical security video mobility and network management products systems and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks whose requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

public sector 

public sector entities include federal governments state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector entities have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector entities through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as through direct sales 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2016  our worldwide sales and marketing departments consisted of approximately 25500 employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in 95 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors hold inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from twotier distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using point of sales information provided by these distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and software maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



product backlog 

our product backlog at july 30 2016  was approximately 46 billion  an increase of 1  year over year after excluding the fiscal 2015 yearend balance of sp video cpe business backlog our product backlog at july 25 2015 was approximately 51 billion including sp video cpe business backlog the product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status subscriptionbased sales arrangements are not included in product backlog our cycle time between order and shipment is generally short and customers occasionally change delivery schedules additionally orders can be canceled without significant penalties as a result of these factors we do not believe that our product backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as our “build buy and partner” approach the foregoing is a way of describing how we innovate we can internally develop or build our own innovative solutions we can acquire or buy companies with innovative technologies and we can partner with companies to jointly develop andor resell product technologies and innovations the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all of the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services we work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions investments and alliances to summarize we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking and communications products and services 



acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies with which we have or recently had strategic alliances include the following 

accenture ltd apple inc att inc cap gemini sa citrix systems inc emc corporation lm ericsson telephone company fujitsu limited inspur group ltd intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa johnson controls inc microsoft corporation netapp inc oracle corporation red hat inc sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy services ltd vce company llc “vce” vmware inc wipro limited and others   

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include amazon web services llc arista networks inc arris group inc avaya inc blue jeans networks brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd citrix systems inc dell inc extreme networks inc f5 networks inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard enterprise company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc lenovo group limited microsoft corporation nokia corporation palo alto networks inc polycom inc riverbed technology inc symantec corporation ubiquiti networks and vmware inc among others   

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple 

previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success   

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of switching ngn routing collaboration service provider video data center wireless security and other product technologies our research and development expenditures were  63 billion  62 billion  and 63 billion  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of increased focus include but are not limited to our core routing and switching products collaboration security and products related to the data center our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time defined as less than one year 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses”

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 













the global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the recent united kingdom “brexit” referendum to withdraw from the european union the current economic challenges in china including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition   

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and also in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 

in addition reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect customers’ perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states trust and confidence in us as an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in routing switching and services and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas such as security iot collaboration next generation data center cloud and software while also focusing on maintaining leadership in routing switching and services however the return on our investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty 

our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in fiscal 2014 on a yearoveryear basis our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter revenue and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

although our product gross margin increased in fiscal 2016 our level of product gross margins have declined in certain prior periods and could decline in future quarters due to adverse impacts from various factors including   



































changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as data center collaboration and service provider video in addition to longer sales cycles sales to the service provider market decreased in 2016 at various times in the past including in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 we experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers sales to the service provider market could continue to decline and as has been the case in the past such sales weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of 

sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is generally recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 









in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in key priority and growth areas for example as products related to network programmability such as sdn products become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware referred to as white box hardware to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market 

as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 busines s of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors asics offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance 

partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 



















we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 







a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our 

requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand in the industry for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or the reramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future   







manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could 

adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products many of our strategic initiatives and investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for automating orchestrating integrating and delivering an everincreasing array of itbased products and services for example several years ago we launched our cisco unified computing system ucs our nextgeneration enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing network storage access and virtualization resources in a single system which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center while our cisco ucs offering remains a significant focus area for us several market transitions are also shaping our strategies and investments 

one such market transition we are focusing on is the move towards more programmable flexible and virtual networks we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine asics hardware and software elements together other examples include our focus on security the market transition related to digital transformation and iot and the transition in cloud 

the process of developing new technology including technology related to more programmable flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions— such as security digital transformation and iot and cloud— is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such as for example networking products based on “white box” hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in a timely fashion offerings to address other transitions or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours 

our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive industryleading security that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected over the last few years we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology if our strategy for addressing our customer needs or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed 

furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our other product categories and key growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction or restructuring costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties 

who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

in august 2016 we announced a restructuring plan under which we began taking action in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service and marketing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas such as security iot collaboration next generation data center cloud and software and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in routing switching and services we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated market transitions and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 















acquisitions may also cause us to   



















mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence for example as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pretax charge of 655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries we also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and also in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 we continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states including impacts from global central bank monetary policy issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries that can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following 















we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries 

we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations see note 12g to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition including net neutrality rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect 

to an alleged underpayment of income taxes social taxes interest and penalties by a brazilian distributor this claim was dismissed on its merits during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to 249 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes 13 billion  for interest and 12 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 30 2016  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 34 countries including the united states has recently made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as cyberattacks data protection breaches computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations harm our operating results and damage our reputation and cyberattacks or data protection breaches on our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us could result in liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

despite our implementation of network security measures the products and services we sell to customers and our servers data centers and the cloudbased solutions on which our data and data of our customers suppliers and business partners are stored are vulnerable to cyberattacks data protection breaches computer viruses and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering or human error any such event could compromise our networks or those of our customers and the information stored on our networks or those of our customers could be accessed publicly disclosed lost or stolen which could subject us to liability to our customers suppliers business partners and others and could have a material adverse effect   on our business operating results and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance and may not be successful breaches of network security in our customers’ networks or in cloudbased services provided by or enabled by us 

regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services could result in liability for us damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business 

in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy transportation or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

as of the end of fiscal 2016 we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 284 billion  that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2017 through 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 30 billion  and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 30 2016  the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually except 34 billion  of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our whollyowned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances

brazil     brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in addition to claims asserted by the brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years tax authorities from the brazilian state of sao paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect to an alleged underpayment of income taxes social taxes interest and penalties by a brazilian distributor this claim was dismissed on its merits during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 

the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to 249 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes 13 billion  for interest and 12 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 30 2016  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years 

russia and the commonwealth of independent states     at the request of the us securities and exchange commission “sec” and the us department of justice we have conducted an investigation into allegations which we and those agencies received regarding possible violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act involving business activities of our operations in russia and certain of the commonwealth of independent states and by certain resellers of our products in those countries we take any such allegations very seriously and we have fully cooperated with and shared the results of our investigation with the sec and the department of justice based on the investigation results both the sec and the department of justice have recently informed us that they have decided not to bring enforcement actions 

backflip software     backflip software inc “backflip” asserted contract tort and fraud claims against us in santa clara county california superior court the proceeding was instituted on march 5 2013 backflip alleges that we conspired with backflips thenceo to allow us to access and use a copy of backflips source code via a preexisting escrow agreement and that subsequently we used that source code in violation of trade secret law and the parties software license agreement five claims brought by backflip were dismissed by the court in an order dated august 1 2016 the claims remaining in the case are for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets backflip will seek compensatory and enhanced damages during a trial currently set for september 12 2016 we believe that we have strong arguments that we were entitled to access and use a copy of the source code 

under the parties’ software license agreement and did not violate trade secret law in addition if the jury were to find for backflip on some or all of its claims we believe that damages would not be material given our assessment of the value of the backflip intellectual property that we are alleged to have misappropriated however due to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation process we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of this litigation at this time 

  sri international     on september 4 2013 sri international inc “sri” asserted patent infringement claims against us in the us district court for the district of delaware accusing our products and services in the area of network intrusion detection of infringing two us patents sri sought monetary damages of at least a reasonable royalty and enhanced damages the trial on these claims began on may 2 2016 and on may 12 2016 the jury returned a verdict finding willful infringement of the asserted patents the jury awarded sri damages of 237 million and the court will decide whether to award enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees and whether an ongoing royalty should be awarded through the expiration of the patents in 2018 in june 2016 we filed posttrial motions we also intend to pursue an appeal to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit on various grounds we believe we have strong arguments to overturn the jury verdict andor reduce the damages award while the ultimate outcome of the case may still result in a loss we do not expect it to be material 

ssl    ssl services llc “ssl” has asserted claims for patent infringement against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas the proceeding was instituted on march 25 2015 ssl alleges that our anyconnect products that include virtual private networking functions infringed a us patent owned by ssl ssl seeks money damages from us on august 18 2015 cisco petitioned the patent trial and appeal board “ptab” of the united states patent and trademark office to review whether the patent ssl has asserted against us is valid over prior art on february 23 2016 a ptab multijudge panel found a reasonable likelihood that cisco would prevail in showing that ssl’s patent claims are unpatentable and instituted proceedings the ptab scheduled a hearing to review our petition for november 16 2016 although a trial of ssl’s claim in district court in texas was set for september 6 2016 the district court issued an order on june 28 2016 staying the district court case pending the final written decision from the ptab we believe we have strong arguments that our products do not infringe and the patent is invalid if we did not prevail and a jury were to find that our anyconnect products infringe we believe damages as appropriately measured would be immaterial due to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation processes however we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of this litigation at this time 

kangtega     cisco systems gmbh “cisco gmbh” is subject to patent claims by kangtega gmbh “kangtega” instituted on june 6 2013 alleging that cisco gmbh infringes in germany a european patent by marketing in germany network intrusiondetection or firewall products known as the “asa” firewall offering on april 29 2014 the mannheim regional court dismissed the infringement action finding no infringement by cisco gmbh of the asserted patent on november 23 2016 a court of appeal in germany oberlandesgericht karlsruhe will hear an appeal of that judgment the matter had been set for july 13 2016 but that hearing was postponed until november 23 2016 in addition on july 25 2016 the german federal patent court issued its grounds for a decision denying cisco’s nullity request with respect to the kangtega patent the nullity decision which is open to appeal regards patent validity and was issued in a separate proceeding from the infringement action in which cisco has previously prevailed in the infringement action kangtega seeks an injunction which would prohibit cisco gmbh’s activities in germany with respect to the asa firewall offering unless cisco gmbh takes a license from kangtega or cisco redesigns the products we believe the lower court ruling in cisco’s favor in the infringement action was correct and should be affirmed we do not anticipate that the outcome of the case would be material however due to uncertainty surrounding the litigation process we are unable to reasonably estimate the outcome of the appeal and any subsequent appeals to a higher court at this time 

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including intellectual property litigation while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for additional information regarding intellectual property litigation see “part ii item 1a risk factorswe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” herein

overview 

cisco designs and sells broad lines of products provides services and delivers integrated solutions to develop and connect networks around the world for over 30 years we have helped our customers build networks and automate orchestrate integrate and digitize information technology it–based products and services in an increasingly connected world cisco is helping to transform businesses governments and cities worldwide over time we have expanded to new markets that are a natural extension of our core networking business as the network has become the platform for delivering an everincreasing portfolio of it–based products and services   

 a summary of our results is as follows in millions except percentages and pershare amounts 



1  during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of the sp video cpe business as a result revenue from this portion of the service provider video product category will not recur in future periods the three months ended july 25 2015  includes sp video cpe business revenue of 487 million  the years ended july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  include sp video cpe business revenue of 504 million  and 1846 million  respectively 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015—financial performance 

for fiscal 2016 our total revenue was flat compared with fiscal 2015  as the service revenue increase of 5  was substantially offset by the product revenue decrease of 1  in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of our sp video cpe business total company revenue for fiscal 2016 increased 3  not including revenue from sp video cpe products for all periods additionally fiscal 2016 had 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2015 thus our results for fiscal 2016 reflect an extra week compared with fiscal 2015 we estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately 265 million 200 million of which was from our services subscriptions and 65 million from our softwareasaservice saas offerings such as webex and a small amount from product distribution total gross margin increased by 25  percentage points driven by productivity improvements the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business and higher service gross margin as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 08  percentage points driven in part by the 253 million  pretax gain from the sale of the sp video cpe business operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 38  percentage points driven by the factors discussed above as well as a decrease in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in august 2014 diluted earnings per share increased by 21  from the prior year as a result of both a 20  increase in net income and a decrease in diluted share count of 58 million  shares 

revenue from the americas decreased by 244 million  driven by the sale of the sp video cpe business revenue for the americas segment increased not including sp video cpe products emea revenue decreased by 41 million  led by a product revenue decline in russia revenue in our apjc segment increased 371 million  led by product revenue growth in china we saw improvements in our revenue from many emerging countries and in particular we experienced product revenue growth in the emerging countries of china india and mexico of 22 18 and 3 respectively the “bricm” countries experienced in the aggregate product revenue growth of 3 despite decreased product revenue in brazil and russia of 34 and 31 respectively 

from a customer market standpoint in fiscal 2016  we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial market and to a lesser extent in the public sector and enterprise markets while the service provider market declined the decline in the service provider market was driven by the sale of the sp video cpe business 

from a product category perspective total company product revenue not including sp video cpe products increased 2  year over year this increase was led by product revenue growth in security and collaboration which grew 13  and 9  respectively we also experienced a 12  increase in revenue from service provider video products not including the cpe business for all periods as well as data center and wireless products which grew 5  and 3  respectively offsetting these increases was a 4  product revenue decrease in our ngn routing category driven primarily by a decrease in sales of our highend router products in addition we believe a cautious service provider capital expenditure spending environment negatively impacted sales in this product category sales of our switching products were flat due to higher sales of data center switches flat sales of switches used in campus environments which comprises the majority of this product category and lower sales of storage products we believe the flat sales of switches used in campus environments was largely driven by uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending 

over this past fiscal year we experienced a challenging environment with significant volatility and a highly competitive landscape after three consecutive quarters of positive business momentum in both the service provider customer market and emerging countries in the aggregate these areas experienced a decline in business momentum during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 while the remainder of the business performed well with positive business momentum 

in summary for fiscal 2016 we experienced solid revenue growth in security switching products used in data centers collaboration and our services categories in addition we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to software and subscriptions we remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio and we believe that we have made solid progress over the past year in these priority areas while the overall macro environment remains uncertain we believe we are well positioned at the same time we are aggressively investing in priority areas to drive growth over the long term regardless of the environment

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  in millions except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso and annualized inventory turns 



critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met when a sale involves multiple deliverables such as sales of products that include services the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met for hosting arrangements we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term 

the amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and if so our valuation of the units of accounting our multiple element arrangements may contain only deliverables within the scope of accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  deliverables within the scope of asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition  or a combination of both according to the accounting guidance prescribed in asc 605 we use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those units when available we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately 80 of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15 of the median rates when vsoe does not exist we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multipledeliverable arrangements under the selling price hierarchy thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of others in our markets and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers in determining esp we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors based on the characteristics of the deliverable we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering companyspecific factors such as geographies competitive landscape internal costs profitability objectives pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 

as our business and offerings evolve over time our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly which could result in changes in selling prices including both vsoe and esp in subsequent periods there were no material impacts during fiscal 2016  nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe tpe or esp 

we make sales to distributors which we refer to as twotier sales to the end customer revenue from twotier distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using pointofsale information provided by these distributors distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other incentive programs and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs if actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

allowances for receivables and sales returns 

the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions except percentages 



1   calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as well as historical and expected default frequency rates which are published by major thirdparty creditrating agencies and are updated on a quarterly basis we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts if a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis we consider historical experience credit quality and age of receivable balances and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis we use expected default frequency rates published by a major thirdparty creditrating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation are complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our operating results both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 

a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates the reserve for future sales returns as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  was 126 million  and 129 million  respectively and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory as of july 30 2016  the liability for these purchase commitments was 159 million  compared with 156 million  as of july 25 2015  and was included in other current liabilities 

our provision for inventory was 65 million  54 million  and 67 million  in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014  respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 134 million  102 million  and 124 million  in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014  respectively if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast 

loss contingencies and product warranties 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we have recorded a liability for the expected remediation cost for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 in february 2014 on the basis of the growing number of failures as described in note 12 f to the consolidated financial statements we decided to expand our approach which resulted in a charge to product cost of sales of 655 million being recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 during fiscal 2016 and 2015 we recorded adjustments to product cost of sales of 74 million  and 164 million  respectively to reduce the liability reflecting net lower than previously estimated future costs to remediate the impacted customer products estimating this liability is complex and subjective and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected our estimated liability may be impacted 

our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 

if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our profitability could be adversely affected 

fair value measurements 

our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities collectively are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of 581 billion  as of july 30 2016  compared with 535 billion  as of july 25 2015  our fixed income investment portfolio as of july 30 2016  consisted primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments it encompasses three classes of investments level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and modelderived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 

our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data we use inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities we use such pricing data as the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2016 and 2015  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 

the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 30 2016    level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  

otherthantemporary impairments 

we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these securities to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected we consider all available information including past events current conditions the remaining payment terms of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of underlying collateral 

for publicly traded equity securities we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

we also have investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages as of july 30 2016  our investments in privately held companies were 1003 million  compared with 897 million  as of july 25 2015  and were included in other assets we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 67 million 41 million and 23 million in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014  respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  was 266 billion  and 245 billion  respectively in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014  for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2016  the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 408 billion for the americas 294 billion for emea and 131 billion for apjc during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were 74 million  and 175 million  during fiscal 2016  and 2015 respectively there were no impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2014  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits domestic manufacturing deductions tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 169  198  and 192  in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014  respectively 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction laws regulations or interpretations thereof by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 34 countries including the united states has recently made changes to numerous longstanding tax principles there can be no assurance that these changes once adopted by countries will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

results of operations 

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015   

for fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  total revenue was flat total company revenue not including sp video cpe products increased 3 product revenue decreased by1 in total but increased by 2 for product revenue not including sp video cpe products service revenue increased by 5 fiscal 2016 had 53 weeks compared with 52 weeks in fiscal 2015 thus our results for fiscal 2016 reflect an extra week we estimate that the additional revenue associated with the extra week was approximately 265 million 200 million of which was from our services subscriptions and 65 million from our saas offerings such as webex and a small amount from product distribution our total revenue grew in our apjc geographic segment while revenue declined in the americas and emea geographic segments the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced 3 product revenue growth with growth in china india and mexico partially offset by decreases in the other two bricm countries 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as was the case during fiscal 2016 such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations our revenue in fiscal 2016  was adversely affected by the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the us dollar and especially currencies in certain emerging countries although the indirect effects are difficult to measure 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multipleelement arrangements the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment as has been the case in certain emerging countries from time to time customers require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support and these activities may occur in future periods which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014   

for fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 total revenue increased by 4 as product and service revenue each increased by 4 our total revenue grew in our americas and emea geographic segments while revenue declined in the apjc segment the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced a 4 product revenue decline with declines in china and russia partially offset by increases in the other three bricm countries 

product revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of our sp video cpe business as a result fiscal 2016 includes only four months of product revenue from our sp video cpe business revenue from this portion of the service provider video product category will not recur in future periods sp video cpe business revenue was 504 million  1846 million  and 2240 million  for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

americas 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the decrease in product revenue for the americas segment was driven by a decline of 1146 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business product revenue not including sp video cpe products increased for the americas segment from a customer markets perspective the decrease in product revenue in the americas segment of 3  was led by a significant decline in the service provider market driven by the sale of the sp video cpe business we experienced product revenue growth in the commercial public sector and enterprise markets the product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to state and local governments partially offset by lower sales to the us federal government   from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 34 in brazil and 24 in canada partially offset by a slight increase in the united states and an increase of 3 in mexico 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the increase in product revenue in the americas segment of 8  was led by solid growth in the public sector commercial and enterprise markets the product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to the us federal government and to a lesser extent higher sales to state and local governments the product revenue growth in the enterprise and commercial markets was driven by strength in the united states   we experienced a product revenue decline in the service provider market in this segment from a country perspective product revenue increased by 8 in the united states 34 in mexico and 2 in brazil 

emea 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the decrease in product revenue of 2  or 198 million  for the emea segment was driven by a decline of 164 million in product sales related to our sp video cpe business from a customer market perspective the decrease was driven by product revenue declines in the service provider public sector and enterprise markets partially offset by product revenue growth in the commercial market the decline in sales to the service provider market was due primarily to the sale of the sp video cpe business product revenue from emerging countries within emea decreased by 11 led by a decline in russia of 31 product revenue for the remainder of the emea segment which primarily consists of countries in western europe increased by 1 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

product revenue in the emea segment increased by 2  driven by growth in the commercial public sector and enterprise markets product revenue in the service provider market was flat   product revenue from emerging countries within emea increased by 1 and product revenue for the remainder of emea grew by 2 

apjc 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the increase in product revenue in the apjc segment of 5  was led by solid growth in the service provider market and to a lesser extent growth in the enterprise public sector and commercial markets from a country perspective product revenue increased by 22 in china driven by an increase in sales of service provider video software and solutions products and 18 in india partially offset by product revenue decreases of 7 in japan and 5 in australia product revenue for this geographic segment was adversely impacted by a 32 million decrease in product revenue related to the sale of our sp video cpe business 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in product revenue in the apjc segment of 4  was led by a significant decline in the service provider market and to a lesser degree in the public sector and enterprise markets these decreases were partially offset by growth in the commercial market from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 21 in china and 5 in japan we experienced product revenue growth of 15 in india and 8 in australia 

product revenue by groups of similar products 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes our product categories consist of the following categories with subcategories in parentheses switching fixed switching modular switching and storage ngn routing highend routers midrange and lowend routers and other ngn routing products collaboration unified communications cisco telepresence and conferencing data center wireless service provider video video software and solutions and cable access security and other products the other products category consists primarily of   emerging technology products and other networking products 

the following table presents revenue for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 



1  during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we completed the sale of the sp video cpe business as a result fiscal 2016 includes only four months of product revenue from sp video cpe business includes sp video cpe business revenue of 504 million  1846 million  and 2240 million  for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014  respectively 

certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period’s presentation 

switching 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

we believe the flat revenue growth in our switching product category was driven in large part by the uncertainty in the macro environment which led to a slowdown in customer spending this led to flat growth in our switching products used in campus environments which comprise the majority of revenue within this product category we also experienced decreased revenue from storage products these impacts were offset by an increase in sales of our switching products used in data centers reflecting strength in our application centric infrastructure portfolio 

in terms of subcategories the increase in revenue from lan fixedconfiguration switches of 5 or 469 million was substantially offset by decreased revenue from our modular switches of 8 or 375 million and the decreased revenue from storage products of 17 or 88 million revenue from our lanfixed configuration switches increased due primarily to higher sales of our cisco catalyst 3850 series switches cisco catalyst 3650 series switches cisco nexus 9300 series switches and cisco nexus 3000 series switches partially offset by a decrease in sales of certain other products in this portfolio decreased revenue from our modular switches was due primarily to lower sales of most of our cisco catalyst series switches and also due to lower sales of our cisco nexus 7000 series switches partially offset by sales growth in cisco nexus 9500 series switches within this product category 

  

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the increase in revenue in our switching product category of 5  or 739 million  was driven by a 9 or 826 million increase in revenue from our lan fixedconfiguration switches and to a lesser extent a 24 or 101 million increase in sales of storage products revenue from lan fixedconfiguration switches increased due to higher sales of most of our cisco nexus series switches and cisco catalyst series switches within this category we experienced a decrease in revenue from our modular switches of 4 or 188 million driven by lower sales of cisco catalyst 6500e series switches and cisco nexus 7000 series switches 

ngn routing 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

we believe a cautious service provider capital expenditure spending environment negatively impacted sales in ngn routing revenue in this product category decreased by 4  or 296 million  driven by an 8 or 378 million decrease in revenue from our highend router products partially offset by an 11 or 48 million increase in revenue from what we categorize as other ngn routing products and a 1 or 34 million increase in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products revenue from highend router products decreased due to a decrease in revenue from most of our highend router products partially offset by higher sales of our crsx products revenue from other ngn routing products increased due to higher sales of optical networking products the revenue increase in the midrange and lowend routers was primarily driven by higher sales of cisco isr products 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our ngn routing product category increased by 1  or 98 million  driven by a 6 or 248 million increase in revenue from our highend router products and a slight increase in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products partially offset by 28 or 171 million decrease in revenue from other ngn routing products revenue from highend router products increased due to an increase in revenue from most products within our cisco asr category and the adoption of our cisco ncs platform and crsx partially offset by lower sales of our legacy highend router products the slight increase in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products was due to higher sales of our cisco isr products partially offset by   lower sales of certain of our access products revenue from other ngn routing products decreased primarily due to lower sales of certain optical networking products 

collaboration 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

revenue from our collaboration product category increased by 9  or 348 million  driven by growth across the various subcategories within this product category the growth in conferencing revenue resulted from higher usage and recurring revenue from webex which we include as product revenue in this category revenue from cisco telepresence products grew due to higher revenue in infrastructure and endpoint products as a result of new product introductions the increase in unified communications revenue was driven by higher software revenue we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our collaboration product category 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our collaboration product category increased by 5  or 187 million  due to increased revenue from our unified communications products as a result of higher software revenue and a slight increase in revenue from phones higher revenue from our cisco telepresence and conferencing products also contributed to the increase revenue from cisco telepresence products increased due to higher revenue in endpoint products as a result of new product introductions the increase in conferencing revenue was a result of higher recurring revenue we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our collaboration product category 

data center 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the increase in revenue in our data center product category of 5  or 146 million  was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our cisco unified computing system products with growth across all geographic segments and most of the customer markets we believe the uncertainty in the macro environment led to a slowdown of customer spending for products in this category additionally we are seeing a market transition with computing workloads shifting from blade server systems to rackbased systems we believe both of these factors adversely impacted the sales of this product category 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our data center product category grew by 22  or 579 million  with sales growth of our cisco unified computing system products across all geographic segments and customer markets the increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing in both data center and cloud environments as current customers increase their data center buildouts and as new customers deploy these offerings 

wireless 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

revenue in our wireless product category increased by 3  or 83 million  due primarily to continued growth in sales of meraki products within this category partially offset by a decrease in sales of our controllers products we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our wireless product category 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our wireless product category increased by 11  or 249 million  driven by continued growth in sales of meraki products combined with continued strength in our 80211ac portfolio we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our wireless product category 

service provider video 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the decrease in revenue from our service provider video product category of 32  or 1131 million  was driven by a decrease in product sales of 1342 million related to our sp video cpe business which we sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenue from certain cable access products and an increase in revenue from our video software and solutions products particularly in china 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in revenue from our service provider video product category of 10  or 414 million  was driven by a 16 or 332 million decrease in sales of our service provider video infrastructure products due primarily to lower sales of settop boxes we also experienced a decrease in revenue from cable access products within this product category 

security 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

revenue in our security product category increased 13  or 222 million  driven by higher sales of advanced threat security web security and unified threat management products we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our security product category 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our security product category was up 12  or 181 million  driven primarily by sales of sourcefire products and to a lesser extent by higher sales of our highend firewall products within our network security product portfolio this increase was partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue from our content security products due to lower sales of web and email security products we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our security product category 

other products 

the yearoveryear increase in revenue in our other products category for fiscal 2016 was due to increased revenue from data and analytics offerings from our cloudrelated offerings and from our iot products driven by our jasper acquisition we experienced a yearoveryear decrease in revenue in our other products category for fiscal 2015 due in large part to the decrease in sales of our other networking products 

service revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

service revenue grew 5  which includes a 200 million or 2 yearoveryear increase as a result of the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 service revenue had solid growth across all of our geographic segments worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 5 and worldwide advanced services revenue increased by 7 technical support services revenue increased across all geographic segments renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which in concert with new service offerings were the primary factors driving the revenue increases advanced services revenue which relates to professional services for specific customer network needs grew across all geographic segments 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 3 and worldwide advanced services revenue increased by 6 driven by growth in subscription revenues technical support services revenue experienced relatively balanced growth across all geographic segments renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which in concert with new service offerings were the primary factors driving the revenue increases advanced services revenue grew across all geographic segments 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 



product gross margin 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2016  



1 productivity includes overall manufacturingrelated costs such as component costs warranty expense provision for inventory freight logistics shipment volume and other items not categorized elsewhere 

product gross margin increased by 27  percentage points as compared with fiscal 2015  the increase in product gross margin was due in large part to productivity improvements which were driven primarily by value engineering efforts favorable component pricing and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes our product gross margin also benefited from the sale during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 of our lower margin sp video cpe business lower amortization expense and impairment charges related to acquisitionrelated intangible assets and a 188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 related to the rockstar patent portfolio the various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets an unfavorable mix of products sold and the lower supplier component remediation adjustment the unfavorable mix of products sold was due to a negative mix impact from our cisco unified computing system products higher sales of service provider video products not including the cpe business and an unfavorable mix within switching products 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2015  



product gross margin increased by 25  percentage points compared with fiscal 2014  the increase in product gross margin was due to productivity improvements which were driven by value engineering efforts favorable component pricing continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations and lower warranty expense the increase was also due to the 655 million charge to product cost of sales in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost to remediate issues with a supplier component in certain products sold in prior fiscal years and an associated 164 million favorable adjustment recorded in fiscal 2015 

additionally gross margin increased due to the mix of products sold the favorable product mix impact was due to revenue decreases from our relatively lower margin service provider video products and a revenue increase from certain of our higher margin core products partially offset by increased revenue from our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products the various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets as well as the unfavorable impact of a 188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2015 related to the rockstar patent portfolio see note 4b to the consolidated financial statements 

service gross margin 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

service gross margin percentage increased by 16  percentage points as compared with fiscal 2015  due to higher sales volume and decreased headcountrelated costs these benefits to gross margin were partially offset by increased partner delivery costs and increased outside services costs 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

service gross margin percentage decreased by 20  percentage points for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  driven by increased cost impacts such as partner delivery costs headcountrelated costs and outside services headcountrelated costs increased due to continued investments in security and cloud managed services and higher variable compensation expense these cost impacts were partially offset by the resulting benefit to gross margin of higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



1   the unallocated corporate items for the years presented include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense significant litigation and other contingencies charges related to asset impairments and restructurings and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the americas segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase due primarily to the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business in this geographic segment productivity improvements were substantially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and product mix the unfavorable mix of products sold was due to increased revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products and an unfavorable mix within our ngn routing products 

the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was due primarily to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment and the sale of the sp video cpe business partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable product mix the unfavorable mix of products sold was due primarily to increased revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the overall gross margin in this geographic segment 

our apjc segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix the mix impact was driven primarily by higher sales from our service provider video products not including the sp video cpe business and unfavorable mix within our ngn routing products 

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

we experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our americas segment due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing the product mix was flat in this geographic segment as the impact of decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin service provider video products offset the increase in revenue from our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products 

the gross margin percentage decrease in our emea segment was due primarily to unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix the unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the overall gross margin in this segment 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements and a favorable mix impact partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing the favorable mix impact was driven by a decrease in revenue from our relatively lower margin service provider video products and an increase in revenue from certain of our higher margin core products   

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2016 had an extra week compared with fiscal 2015 we estimate that the extra week contributed approximately 116 million in total operating expenses not including sharebased compensation expense discussed below 

rd expenses 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

rd expenses increased for fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  primarily due to higher headcountrelated expenses attributable in part to the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and to a lesser extent higher sharebased compensation expense these increases were partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated costs and lower discretionary spending 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in rd expenses for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  was primarily due to higher compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme networks inc “insieme” see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements efficiencies arising from our restructuring action announced in august 2014 also contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher contracted services and higher sharebased compensation expense 

sales and marketing expenses 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

sales and marketing expenses decreased for fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  due to lower discretionary spending and lower headcountrelated expenses the aforementioned items benefited from foreign exchange rates during fiscal 2016 lower sharebased compensation expense also contributed to the decrease 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

sales and marketing expenses increased for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  due to higher headcountrelated expenses driven by increased variable compensation expense and higher discretionary spending partially offset by lower compensation expense from acquisitions 

ga expenses 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

ga expenses decreased in fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  primarily due to the 253 million  pretax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business and to a lesser extent lower contracted services and lower sharebased compensation expense partially offset by higher headcountrelated expenses the extra week in fiscal 2016 contributed to the increased headcountrelated expenses 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

ga expenses increased in fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  primarily due to increased variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance higher sharebased compensation expense and the timing of corporatelevel expenses corporatelevel expenses which tend to vary from period to period included operational infrastructure activities such as it project implementations which included investments in our global data center infrastructure and investments related to operational and financial systems 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2016  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 567 million  or 31  compared with fiscal 2015  in fiscal 2015  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 278 million  or 16  compared with fiscal 2014  

headcount 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

our headcount increased by approximately 1800 employees in fiscal 2016  due to headcount additions from targeted hiring in key growth areas in engineering and services and due also to headcount additions from our recent acquisitions these headcount additions were partially offset by headcount reductions from our restructuring plan announced in august 2014 and from the sale of the sp video cpe business 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in headcount of approximately 2200 employees in fiscal 2015  was due to headcount reductions from attrition and from our restructuring plan announced in august 2014 these headcount reductions were partially offset by headcount additions from targeted hiring in engineering and services and also by headcount additions from our recent acquisitions 

sharebased compensation expense 

the following table presents sharebased compensation expense in millions 



the increase in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  was due primarily to the timing of rsu grants and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 partially offset by lower net expense associated with accelerated and modified awards 

the increase in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  was due primarily to higher expense associated with performancebased restricted stock units and charges associated with severance arrangements with certain executives partially offset by lower expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets in millions 

amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired partially offset by amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions lower impairment charges in fiscal 2016 also contributed to the decrease 

amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  primarily due to the impairment charges of approximately 175 million recorded in fiscal 2015 the impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value resulting from reductions in or the elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of our technology and iprd intangible assets 

restructuring and other charges 

in connection with a restructuring action announced in august 2014 we incurred restructuring and other charges of 267 million and 489 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015 respectively these charges were related primarily to severance and other onetime termination benefits and other associated costs we completed this plan at the end of fiscal 2016   

in connection with a restructuring action announced in august 2013 we incurred restructuring and other charges of approximately 418 million  during fiscal 2014 which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction under this plan we completed this plan at the end of fiscal 2014 

in august 2016 we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 5500  employees representing approximately 7  of our global workforce we began taking action under this plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we currently estimate that we will recognize pretax charges in an amount of up to 700 million  consisting of severance and other onetime termination benefits and other associated costs we expect that approximately 325 million  to 400 million  of these charges will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 with the remaining amount to be recognized during the rest of the fiscal 2017 we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key priority areas such as security iot collaboration next generation data center and cloud as a result the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

for fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  operating income increased by 18  and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 38  percentage points the increase resulted from the following a gross margin percentage increase driven in part by the sale of the lower margin sp video cpe business during fiscal 2016 the 253 million  pretax gain from the sale of our sp video cpe business and a decrease in restructuring and other charges related to the restructuring action announced in august 2014 

for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  operating income increased by 15  and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 21  percentage points the increase resulted from the following an increase in revenue a gross margin percentage increase driven in part by the 655 million supplier component remediation charge or 14 percentage points of fiscal 2014 revenue recorded in fiscal 2014 and higher compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme 

interest and other income loss net 

interest income expense net   the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

interest income increased in fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments as well as higher yields on our portfolio of cash and investments the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2016  compared with fiscal 2015  was driven by higher average debt balances and the impact of higher effective interest rates on floatingrate senior notes and interest rate swaps associated with fixedrate senior notes 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

interest income increased in fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments interest expense in fiscal 2015 as compared with the prior fiscal year increased slightly driven by additional interest expense due to the net increase in longterm debt in fiscal 2015 

other income loss net     the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the change in total net gains losses on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  was primarily attributable to lower realized gains on publicly traded equity securities and net losses on fixed income securities in fiscal 2016 compared to net gains in fiscal 2015 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities 

the change in net gains losses on investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  was primarily due to a gain of 126 million related to the reorganization of our investment in vce which was recorded in fiscal 2015 

the change in other gains losses net in fiscal 2016  as compared with fiscal 2015  was driven by higher donation expenses and net unfavorable foreign exchange impacts partially offset by higher gains from customer lease terminations 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in total net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to lower gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current period as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities 

the change in net gains losses on investments in privately held companies for the fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a 126 million gain recorded in fiscal 2015 related to the reorganization of our investments in vce and lower losses related to this investment under the equity method we ceased accounting for vce under the equity method in october 2014 these favorable items were partially offset by higher impairment charges and lower realized gains from sales of various investments in privately held companies 

the change in other gains losses net in fiscal 2015 as compared with fiscal 2014 was driven by equity derivative impacts and higher donation expenses partially offset by net favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2015 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 169  for fiscal 2016  compared with 198  for fiscal 2015  the net 29  percentage point decrease in the effective tax rates between fiscal years was primarily due to a nonrecurring net tax benefit of 367 million or 28 percentage points related to a tax settlement with the irs in fiscal 2016 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 198 for fiscal 2015 compared with 192 for fiscal 2014 the net 06 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily due to a decrease in foreign income taxed at lower than us rates partially offset by an increase in us federal rd tax credit 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments   the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2016  was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of 136 billion  a net increase in debt of 31 billion  proceeds from issuance of common stock of 11 billion  pursuant to employee stock incentive and purchase plans and net proceeds from the sale of our sp video cpe business of 04 billion  these sources of cash were partially offset by cash returned to shareholders in the form of cash dividends of 48 billion  and repurchase of common stock of 39 billion  under the stock repurchase program net cash paid for acquisitions of 32 billion  and capital expenditures of 11 billion  

our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was 598 billion  and 534 billion  as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  respectively under current tax laws and regulations if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes the balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the united states as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  was 59 billion  and 70 billion  respectively 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

free cash flow and capital allocation     as part of our capital allocation strategy we intend to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue excess tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other required uses of cash including 

repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



any future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors 

accounts receivable net the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions and dso 



our accounts receivable net as of july 30 2016  increased by approximately 9  compared with the end of fiscal 2015  our dso as of july 30 2016  was higher by four  days as compared with the end of fiscal 2015  as there was a relatively higher proportion of service billings in the latter part of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2016 

inventory supply chain   the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions except annualized inventory turns 



inventory as of july 30 2016  decreased by 25  from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2015  and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 4  on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 10  compared with the end of fiscal 2015  the decrease in inventory and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due in part to the sale of the sp video cpe business we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts 

our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers manufactured finished goods consist primarily of buildtoorder and buildtostock products 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees  we measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue as of july 30 2016  our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows in millions 



financing receivables   financing receivables less unearned income increased by 1  compared with the end of fiscal 2015  the change was primarily due to a 21  increase in loan receivables partially offset by a 6  decrease in financed service contracts and other and a 3  decrease in lease receivables we provide financing to certain enduser customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products services and networking solutions these financing arrangements include leases financed service contracts and loans arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets lease receivables include salestype and directfinancing leases we also provide certain qualified customers financing for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 

financing guarantees   in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms the volume of channel partner financing was 269 billion  259 billion  and 246 billion  in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014  respectively these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was 11 billion  and 12 billion  as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  respectively we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed 

deferred revenue related to financing receivables and guarantees   the majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts the majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts which primarily relates to technical support services is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed a portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met 

borrowings 

senior notes   the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 



1 in february 2016 we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of 70 billion  

interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium interest is payable quarterly on the floatingrate notes we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 30 2016  

we repaid the fixedrate notes 550 due on february 22 2016 for an aggregate principal amount of 30 billion  upon maturity 

we repaid the floatingrate notes due on september 3 2015 for an aggregate principal amount of 850 million  upon maturity 

other debt   other debt as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements   the amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was 1 million   and 4 million  as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  respectively 

commercial paper   we established a shortterm debt financing program of up to 30 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes we had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  

credit facility   on may 15 2015 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on may 15 2020 any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or c libor or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the administrative agent “eurocurrency rate” for an interest period of one month plus 100 or ii the eurocurrency rate plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial 

services llc and moody’s investors service inc provided that in no event will the eurocurrency rate be less than zero the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that it maintains an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 

we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion andor extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to may 15 2022 we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

deferred revenue   the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



total deferred revenue increased 8  in fiscal 2016 deferred service revenue increased 9  driven by the timing of multiyear arrangements an increase in customers paying technical support service contracts over time and the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue deferred product revenue increased 8  primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription and software revenue arrangements partially offset by lower deferred revenue related to twotier distributors the product categories of collaboration security and wireless were the key contributors to the increase in deferred product revenue the portion of deferred product revenue related to recurring software and subscriptions increased 33 including the portion related to our security products which increased 29 and our collaboration products which increased 13 

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 30 2016  in millions 



operating leases   for more information on our operating leases see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers   we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” as of july 30 2016  the liability for these purchase commitments was 159 million  and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 

other purchase obligations   other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt   the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities   other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 925 million  and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 278 million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

insieme networks inc    in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we made an investment in insieme an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market as set forth in the agreement between cisco and insieme this investment included 100 million  of funding and a license to certain of our technology immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below we owned approximately 83  of insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of insieme in our consolidated financial statements in connection with this investment we entered into a putcall option agreement that provided us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in insieme in addition the noncontrolling interest holders could require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we exercised our call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in insieme the acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments which will be determined using agreedupon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of insieme’s products during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014  we recorded compensation expense of 160 million  207 million  and 416 million  respectively related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that were earned or expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders continued vesting will result in additional compensation expense in future periods based on the terms of the agreement we have determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately 836 million  which includes the 783 million  that has been expensed to date net of forfeitures 

the former noncontrolling interest holders earned the maximum amount related to the first milestone payment and were paid approximately 389 million  for a portion of this amount during fiscal 2016  during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we expect to pay approximately 325 million pursuant to the second milestone payment and continued vesting of the first milestone payment 

other funding commitments   we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 222 million  as of july 30 2016  compared with 205 million  as of july 25 2015  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers these privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 30 2016  there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

securities lending 

we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis the average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2016  and 2015 was 10 billion  and 04 billion  respectively we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  we had no outstanding securities lending transactions we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities   we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july 30 2016  our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july 30 2016  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 bps or minus 150 bps was relevant the hypothetical fair values as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  are as follows in millions 

  





financing receivables   as of july 30 2016  our financing receivables had a carrying value of 84 billion  compared with 83 billion  as of july 25 2015  as of july 30 2016  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt     as of july 30 2016  we had 284 billion  in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which consisted of 34 billion  floatingrate notes and 250 billion  fixedrate notes the carrying amount of the senior notes was 286 billion  and the related fair value based on market prices was 309 billion  as of july 30 2016  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 99 billion  of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 06 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt that is not hedged 

equity price risk 

the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard  poor’s 500 index or nasdaq composite index these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

publicly traded equity securities   the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio excluding hedged equity securities if any potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 20 and 30 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of july 30 2016  and july 25 2015  are as follows in millions 





investments in privately held companies   we have also invested in privately held companies these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method as of july 30 2016  the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 1003 million  compared with 897 million  at july 25 2015  some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as was the case during fiscal 2016  such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2016  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 567 million  or 31  as compared with fiscal 2015  in fiscal 2015  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 278 million  or 16  as compared with fiscal 2014  to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes

strategy and focus areas 

we see our customers in every industry increasingly using technology—and specifically the network—to grow their business drive efficiencies and try to gain a competitive advantage in this increasingly digital world data is the most strategic asset and is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem—on customer premises at the edge of the network and in the cloud the network also plays an increasingly important role enabling our customers to aggregate automate and draw insights from this highly distributed data where there is a premium on security and speed this is driving them to adopt entirely new it architectures and organizational structures we understand how technology can deliver the outcomes our customers want to achieve and our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive industryleading security that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected 

to deliver on our strategy we are focused on providing highly secure automated and intelligent solutions built on infrastructure that connects data that is highly distributed globally dispersed across organizations together with our ecosystem of partners and developers we aim to provide the technology services and solutions that we believe will enable our customers to gain insight and advantage from this distributed data with scale security and agility   

over the last few years we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology we are focused on how we accelerate what is working and change what is not simplify our business and our communication drive operational rigor in everything we do and invest in our culture and our talent 

we will strive to continue to lead the market transitions in our core markets and enter new markets where the network is foundational in order to further our strategy we continue to drive product transitions across many of our businesses including the introduction of nextgeneration products that offer in our view better priceperformance and architectural advantages compared with both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors we believe that many of these product transitions are gaining momentum based on the strong yearoveryear product revenue growth for certain of the new products we do continue to manage through the transitions of several of our existing key product platforms and we continue to see the impact of those transitions on our overall core performance as we go forward we plan to continue to deliver innovation across our portfolio in order to sustain our leadership and strategic position with customers 

market transitions 

we continue to seek to capitalize on market transitions as sources of future revenue opportunities as part of the continued transformation of our business and we believe market transitions in the it industry are occurring with greater frequency market transitions relating to the network are becoming in our view more significant as intelligent networks have moved from being a cost center issue—where the focus is on reducing network operating costs and increasing networkrelated productivity—to becoming a platform for revenue generation business agility and competitive advantage some examples of significant market transitions are as follows 

digitizationinternet of everything       globally countries cities industries and businesses are becoming digital to capitalize on the next wave of the internet  the internet of everything ioe which we define as the connection of people processes data and things when people processes data and things are connected we believe it creates an opportunity to deliver better customer experiences create new revenue streams and operating models to drive efficiency and produce value 

our goal is to be a strategic partner to our customers by providing the solutions people partners and experience as our customers move from traditional to digital businesses we believe our customers’ journey to becoming digital businesses requires security cloud mobile social and analytic technologies with a strong foundation of an intelligent network that is agile simple and that provides real time business insight 

the move to digital is driving many of our customers to adopt entirely new it architectures and organization structures in our view we are delivering the architectural approach and solutionbased results to help them reduce complexity accelerate and grow and manage risk in a world that is increasingly virtualized application centric cloudbased analyticsdriven and mobile 

virtualizationapplication centricity     we are focusing on a market transition involving the move toward more programmable flexible and virtual networks sometimes called software defined networking sdn and network function virtualization nfv this transition is focused on moving from a hardwarecentric approach for networking to a virtualized network environment that is designed to enable flexible applicationdriven customization of network infrastructures we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine applicationspecific integrated circuits asics with hardware and software elements together to meet customers’ total cost of ownership quality security scalability and experience requirements in our view there is no single architecture that supports all customer requirements in this area 

we believe the promise of sdn is to enable more open and programmable network infrastructure we are addressing this opportunity with a unique strategy and set of solutions that is designed to address the application demands transition and offers a holistic approach to the future of networking that responds automatically to the needs of applications we introduced and began shipping our application centric infrastructure aci which delivers centralized applicationdriven policy automation management and visibility of both physical and virtual environments as a single system aci is comprised of our nexus 9000 portfolio of switches enhanced versions of our nxos operating system and the application policy infrastructure controller apic which provides a central place to configure automate and manage an entire network based on the needs of applications 

cloud       our cloud strategy is to connect private and public clouds working across hypervisors software programs used to create and manage virtual environments and utilizing openstack an open source computing platform to deliver integrated hybridcloud solutions we believe clouds need to be secure and support a rich ecosystem of networkenabled applications to deliver the data and analytics that support the digitization of our customers environments as part of our cloud strategy we are delivering infrastructure our intercloud fabric software and our cloud services including webex and meraki among other applications 

we believe that customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique recognizing that we offer a solution to different cloud environments including federated private hybrid and public clouds that enables them to move their cloud workloads across heterogeneous private and public clouds with the necessary policy security and management features 

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements

the advanced services program supports networking devices applications solutions and complete infrastructures our service and support strategy is focused on capitalizing on increased globalization and we believe this strategy along with our architectural approach has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors 

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 or more of our revenue our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise service provider commercial and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we strive to take advantage of the networkasaplatform strategy to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide this customer market category includes regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also group media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased services and contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our routing and switching optical security video mobility and network management products systems and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the scale and complexity of their networks which requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

commercial 

we define commercial businesses as companies which typically have fewer than 1000 employees the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market are served by a combination of our direct salesforce and our channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or companies with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain these smaller companies within the commercial market are primarily served by our channel partners 

public sector 

public sector entities include federal governments state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector entities have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector entities through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as direct sales to these customers   

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2015  our worldwide sales and marketing departments consisted of approximately 25000 employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in 93 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors hold inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and software maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



for additional information regarding these financing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

product backlog 

our product backlog at july 25 2015  the last day of fiscal 2015  was approximately 51 billion  compared with product backlog of approximately 54 billion  at july 26 2014  the last day of fiscal 2014  the product backlog includes orders confirmed for products planned to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our product backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the three components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as our “build buy and partner” approach the foregoing is a way of describing how we strive to innovate we can internally develop or build our own innovative solutions we can acquire or buy companies with innovative technologies and we can partner with companies to jointly develop andor resell product technologies and innovations the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all of the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services we work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions investments and alliances to summarize we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking and communications products and services 

 acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies with which we have or recently had strategic alliances include the following 

accenture ltd apple inc att inc cap gemini sa citrix systems inc emc corporation fujitsu limited intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa johnson controls inc microsoft corporation netapp inc nokia siemens networks oracle corporation red hat inc sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy services ltd vce company llc “vce” vmware inc wipro limited and others   

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include alcatellucent amazon web services llc arista networks inc arris group inc avaya inc blue jeans networks brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd citrix systems inc dell inc lm ericsson telephone company extreme networks inc f5 networks inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc lenovo group limited microsoft corporation palo alto networks inc polycom inc riverbed technology inc ruckus wireless inc symantec corporation ubiquiti networks and vmware inc among others   

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success   

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of switching ngn routing collaboration service provider video data center wireless security and other product technologies for this purpose our research and development expenditures were  62 billion  63 billion  and 59 billion  in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of increased focus include but are not limited to our core routing and switching products collaboration and products related to the data center our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time defined as less than one year 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses” 

employees 

employees are summarized as follows 



1   cost of sales includes manufacturing support services and training 

we consider the relationships with our employees to be positive competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include   





































as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 













the global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world the current economic challenges in china including global economic ramifications of chinese economic difficulties and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example sales in several of our emerging countries decreased in recent periods including in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 and we expect that this weakness will continue for at least a few quarters 

in addition reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect customers’ perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states trust and confidence in us as an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in routing switching and services and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key growth areas such as data center virtualization software security and cloud while also focusing on maintaining leadership in routing switching and services however the return on our investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty 

our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in fiscal 2014 on a yearoveryear basis our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past 

quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter revenue and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

although our product gross margin increased in the second half of fiscal 2015 our level of product gross margins have declined in recent periods and could decline in future quarters due to adverse impacts from various factors including   



































changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as data center collaboration and service provider video in addition to longer sales cycles although sales to the service provide segment increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 at various times in the past including in fiscal 2014 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 we experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers we could again experience declines in sales to the service provide market and as has been the case in the past such sales weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is generally recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 









in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in key growth areas for example as products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products based on commoditized hardware referred to as white box hardware to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market 

as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 busines s of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 



















we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 







a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our 

requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand in the industry for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or the reramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future   







manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multipleparty collaborative interaction would demand and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it for example in fiscal 2009 we launched our cisco unified computing system ucs our nextgeneration enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing network storage access and virtualization resources in a single system which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center while our cisco ucs offering remains a significant focus area for us several market transitions are also shaping our strategies and investments 

one such market transition we are focusing on is the move towards more programmable flexible and virtual networks in our view this evolution is in its very early stages and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine asics hardware and software elements together other examples include our focus on the ioe market transition a potentially significant transition in the it industry and a transition in cloud where we are architecting the cisco intercloud solution 

the process of developing new technology including technology related to more programmable flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions including ioe and cloud is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such as for example networking products based on “white box” hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in a timely fashion offerings to address other transitions or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours 

our strategy is to lead our customers in their digital transition with solutions including pervasive industryleading security that intelligently connect nearly everything that can be connected over the last few years we have been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions as a part of this transformation we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology if our strategy for addressing our customer needs or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed 

furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our other product categories and key growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated write 

offs workforce reduction or restructuring costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

in august 2014 as part of our strategy of continuing to invest in growth innovation and talent while also managing costs and driving efficiencies we announced a restructuring plan we began taking action under this plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and expect this plan to be substantially completed during the first half of fiscal 2016 the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service and marketing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key growth areas such as data center virtualization software security and cloud and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in routing switching and services we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated transition to ioe and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure including spending or investment related to ioe we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 















acquisitions may also cause us to   



















mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities and key growth areas we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence for example as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pretax charge of 655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 the corresponding liability was reduced by 164 million related to an adjustment recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries we also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners although sales in several of our emerging countries decreased in recent periods including in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 several of our emerging countries generally have been relatively fast growing and we have announced plans to expand our commitments and expectations in certain of those countries we expect that the weakness we experienced in recent periods in several emerging countries will continue for at least a few quarters our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states including impacts from global central bank monetary policy issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries which can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following   















we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries 

we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations see note 12g to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition including proposed net neutrality rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect 

to an alleged underpayment of income taxes social taxes interest and penalties by a brazilian distributor the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2008 and the related asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to approximately 262 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes approximately 11 billion  for interest and approximately 12 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 25 2015  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association of 34 countries including the united states is contemplating changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these contemplated changes if finalized and adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

we had senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 253 billion  as of july 25 2015  that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2015 through 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 30 billion  and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 25 2015  the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually except 325 billion  of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our whollyowned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances

a summary of our results is as follows in millions except percentages and pershare amounts 



fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014—financial performance 

total revenue increased by 4  as compared with fiscal 2014  with product and service revenue each increasing by 4  total gross margin increased by 15  percentage points as we experienced stable gross margins and the absence in fiscal 2015 of a 655 million supplier component remediation charge recorded in fiscal 2014 as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 08  percentage points primarily as a result of higher acquisitionrelated compensation expense in fiscal 2014 operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 21  percentage points diluted earnings per share increased by 17  from the prior year as a result of both a 14  increase in net income and a decrease in diluted share count by 135 million  shares 

in fiscal 2015  revenue increased by 20 billion  as compared with fiscal 2014  revenue from the americas increased by 19 billion  driven in large part by higher product revenue in the united states emea revenue increased 03 billion  led by higher product revenue in the united kingdom revenue in our apjc segment decreased 02 billion  led by a product revenue decline in china we experienced decreased product revenue in the emerging countries of china and russia and increased revenue in mexico india and brazil as the “bricm” countries experienced in the aggregate a product revenue decline of 4 we believe that the product revenue declines we experienced in various emerging countries reflected the impact of economic and geopolitical challenges in those countries 

from a customer market standpoint in fiscal 2015  we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial public sector and enterprise markets while the service provider market continued to decline the decline in service provider market was driven by the product revenue decline in our service provider video category 

from a product category perspective the product revenue increase of 4   yearoveryear was driven in part by product revenue growth in our core switching and ngn routing products which grew 5  and 1  respectively we also experienced an increase in revenue from data center and security products which grew 22  and 12  respectively our other major product categories experienced revenue growth with the exception of service provider video which decreased by 10  our deferred product revenue grew 21 yearoveryear driven by subscription and software revenue arrangements with strength in collaboration security and wireless service revenue increased by 4  year over year 

in summary during fiscal 2015  we achieved solid and profitable revenue growth despite encountering challenges similar to those we experienced during fiscal 2014  in the service provider market and certain emerging countries 

fourth quarter snapshot 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2014  total revenue grew 4  as product and service revenue each increased by 4  with regard to our geographic segment performance on a yearoveryear basis revenue in the americas increased by 7  while emea and apjc were both flat from a product category perspective product revenue growth was driven by growth from collaboration and data center products as each grew 14 year over year total gross margin increased by 03  percentage points as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 09  percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 07  percentage points diluted earnings per share increased by 5  from the prior year primarily as a result of both a 3  increase in net income and a decrease in our diluted share count by 41 million  shares 

strategy and focus areas

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  in millions except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso and annualized inventory turns 



our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2015  was 51 billion  or 10  of fiscal 2015  total revenue compared with 54 billion  at the end of fiscal 2014  or 12  of fiscal 2014  total revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met when a sale involves multiple deliverables such as sales of products that include services the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met for hosting arrangements we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term 

the amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and if so our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables according to the accounting guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  we use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those units when available we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately 80 of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15 of the median rates when vsoe does not exist we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multipledeliverable arrangements under the selling price hierarchy thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of others in our markets and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers in determining esp we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering companyspecific factors such as geographies competitive landscape internal costs profitability objectives pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 

some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition  

as our business and offerings evolve over time our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly which could result in changes in selling prices including both vsoe and esp in subsequent periods there were no material impacts during fiscal 2015  nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe tpe or esp 

revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements service support and other factors financing arrangements may include salestype directfinancing and operating leases loans and guarantees of thirdparty financing our deferred revenue for products was 54 billion  and 45 billion  as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  respectively technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed which typically is from one to three years advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance milestones our deferred revenue for services was 98 billion  and 96 billion  as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  respectively 

we make sales to distributors which we refer to as twotier systems of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs if actual credits received by our distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

allowances for receivables and sales returns 

the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions except percentages 



1   calculated as allowance for credit loss on lease receivables as a percentage of gross lease receivables and residual value before unearned income 

the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates which are published by major thirdparty creditrating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts if a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis we consider historical experience credit quality and age of receivable balances and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis we use expected default frequency rates published by a major thirdparty creditrating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation are complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our operating results both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 

a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates the reserve for future sales returns as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  was 129 million  and 135 million  respectively and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

our inventory balance was 16 billion  as of each july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory as of july 25 2015  the liability for these purchase commitments was 156 million  compared with 162 million  as of july 26 2014  and was included in other current liabilities 

our provision for inventory was 54 million  67 million  and 114 million  in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013  respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 102 million  124 million  and 106 million  in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013  respectively if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast 

loss contingencies and product warranties 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we have recorded a liability for the expected remediation cost for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 in february 2014 on the basis of the growing number of failures as described in note 12 f to the consolidated financial statements we decided to expand our approach which resulted in a charge to product cost of sales of 655 million being recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 during the third quarter of fiscal 2015 we recorded an adjustment to product cost of sales of 164 million to reduce the liability reflecting net lower than previously estimated future costs to remediate the impacted customer products estimating this liability is complex and subjective and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected our estimated liability may be impacted 

our liability for product warranties included in other current liabilities was 449 million  as of july 25 2015  compared with 446 million  as of july 26 2014  our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 

the provision for product warranties during fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013  was 696 million  704 million  and 649 million  respectively if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our profitability could be adversely affected 

fair value measurements 

our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities collectively are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of 535 billion as of july 25 2015  compared with 453 billion as of july 26 2014  our fixed income investment portfolio as of july 25 2015  consisted primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments it encompasses three classes of investments level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and modelderived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 

our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data we use inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities we use such pricing data as the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2015 and 2014  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 

the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 25 2015    level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  

otherthantemporary impairments 

we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these securities to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected we consider all available information including past events current conditions the remaining payment terms of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of underlying collateral 

for publicly traded equity securities we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

there were no impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2015  and 2013 and we recognized 11 million of such impairment charges in earnings for fiscal 2014 there were no impairment charges on our investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

we also have investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages as of july 25 2015  our investments in privately held companies were 897 million  compared with 899 million  as of july 26 2014  and were included in other assets we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 41 million 23 million and 33 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013  respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  was 245 billion  and 242 billion  respectively   in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013  for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2015  the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 408 billion for the americas 326 billion for emea and 129 billion for apjc    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015  we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were 175 million  during fiscal 2015  there were no impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits domestic manufacturing deductions tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 198  192  and 111  in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013  respectively 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 34 countries including the united states is contemplating changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these contemplated changes if finalized and adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

results of operations 

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014   

for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  total revenue increased by 4  as product and service revenue each increased by 4  our total revenue grew in our americas and emea geographic segments while revenue declined in the apjc segment the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced a 4 product revenue decline with declines in china and russia partially offset by increases in the other three bricm countries 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as was the case during fiscal 2015 such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations our revenue in fiscal 2015  and in particular our revenue for emea and apjc was adversely affected by the depreciation of certain currencies relative to the us dollar especially in certain emerging countries although the indirect effects are difficult to measure 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multipleelement arrangements the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment as has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time customers require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support and these activities may occur in future periods which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013   

for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  total revenue decreased by 3  product revenue decreased by 5  while service revenue increased by 4  the decrease in product revenue reflected declines across all geographic segments as well as across all customer markets service revenues experienced slower growth in our americas and apjc geographic segments while we experienced slightly faster growth in the emea segment 

product revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



americas 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the increase in product revenue in the americas segment of 8  was led by solid growth in the public sector commercial and enterprise markets the product revenue growth in the public sector market was due primarily to higher sales to the us federal government and to a lesser extent higher sales to state and local governments the product revenue growth in the enterprise and commercial markets was driven by strength in the united states   we experienced a product revenue decline in the service provider market in this segment from a country perspective product revenue increased by 8 in the united states 34 in mexico and 2 in brazil 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

product revenue in the americas segment decreased by 5  led by a significant decline in the service provider market and to a lesser extent declines in the public sector and commercial markets product revenue declined in the us public sector market led by lower sales to the us federal government    from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 5 in the united states 10 in canada and 13 in brazil partially offset by an increase of 2 in mexico 

emea 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

product revenue in the emea segment increased by 2  driven by growth in the commercial public sector and enterprise markets product revenue in the service provider market was flat   product revenue from emerging countries within emea increased by 1 and product revenue for the remainder of emea grew by 2 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

product revenue in the emea segment decreased by 4  led by a decline in the service provider market and to a lesser extent declines in the enterprise and public sector markets product revenue from emerging countries within emea decreased by 11 led by a 24 decrease in russia product revenue for the remainder of emea which is primarily composed of countries in western europe declined by 2 

apjc 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in product revenue in the apjc segment of   4   was led by a significant decline in the service provider market and to a lesser degree in the public sector and enterprise markets these decreases were partially offset by growth in the commercial market from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 21 in china and 5 in japan we experienced product revenue growth of 15 in india and 8 in australia 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

product revenue in the apjc segment decreased by 7  led by declines in the service provider and enterprise markets and to a lesser extent a decline in the commercial market we continued to experience declines in many of the emerging countries within this segment most notably in india which experienced a yearoveryear product revenue decline of 15 other countries that contributed to the weakness in this segment included japan australia and china which experienced yearoveryear product revenue declines of 11 7 and 6 respectively 

product revenue by groups of similar products 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes our product categories consist of the following categories with subcategories in parentheses switching fixed switching modular switching and storage ngn routing highend routers midrange and lowend routers and other ngn routing products collaboration unified communications cisco telepresence and conferencing service provider video infrastructure video software and solutions and cable access data center wireless security and other products the other products category consists primarily of   emerging technology products and other networking products 

the following table presents revenue for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 



certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period amounts to conform to the current period’s presentation 

switching 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the increase in revenue in our switching product category of 5  or 740 million  was driven by a 9 or 826 million increase in revenue from our lan fixedconfiguration switches and to a lesser extent a 24 or 102 million increase in sales of storage products revenue from lan fixedconfiguration switches increased due to higher sales of most of our cisco nexus series switches and cisco catalyst series switches within this category we experienced a decrease in revenue from our modular switches of 4 or 188 million driven by lower sales of cisco catalyst 6500e series switches and cisco nexus 7000 series switches 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

revenue in our switching product category decreased by 5  or 710 million  driven by a 12 or 656 million decrease in revenue from our modular switches revenue from our modular switches decreased due to lower sales of cisco catalyst 6000 series switches we also experienced a 3 decrease in sales of storage products within this category revenue from our lan fixedconfiguration switches was relatively flat year over year as lower sales of most of our fixedconfiguration cisco catalyst series switches and fixedconfiguration cisco nexus series switches were offset by the continued adoption of cisco catalyst 3850 series switches and cisco nexus 6000 series switches 

ngn routing 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our ngn routing product category increased by 1  or 95 million  driven by a 6 or 248 million increase in revenue from our highend router products and a slight increase in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products partially offset by 28 or 171 million decrease in revenue from other ngn routing products revenue from highend router products increased due to an increase in revenue from most products within our cisco asr category and the adoption of our cisco ncs platform and crsx partially offset by lower sales of our legacy highend router products the slight increase in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products was due to higher sales of our cisco isr products partially offset by   lower sales of certain of our access products revenue from other ngn routing products decreased primarily due to lower sales of certain optical networking products 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the decrease in revenue in our ngn routing product category of 7  or 559 million  was driven by a 6 or 278 million decrease in revenue from highend router products an 8 or 227 million decrease in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products and an 8 or 54 million decrease in revenue from other ngn routing products revenue from our highend products decreased d ue to lower sales of cisco crs3 carrier routing system products and our legacy highend router products partially offset by increased sales of our cisco asr edge products the decrease in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products was driven by lower sales of our cisco isr products revenue from other ngn routing products decreased due to lower sales of certain optical networking products 

collaboration 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our collaboration product category increased by 5  or 185 million  due to increased revenue from our unified communications products as a result of higher software revenue and a slight increase in revenue from phones higher revenue from our cisco telepresence and conferencing products also contributed to the increase revenue from cisco telepresence products increased due to higher revenue in endpoint products as a result of new product introductions the increase in conferencing revenue was a result of higher recurring revenue we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our collaboration product category 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

we continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our collaboration product category overall revenue in our collaboration product category decreased by 6  or 242 million  primarily due to decreased revenue from our cisco telepresence and unified communications products driven by weakness in endpoint products such as phones these decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from our conferencing products 

service provider video 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in revenue from our service provider video product category of 10  or 414 million  was driven by a 16 or 332 million decrease in sales of our service provider video infrastructure products due primarily to lower sales of settop boxes we also experienced a decrease in revenue from cable access products within this product category 

on july 22 2015 we entered into an exclusive agreement to sell the client premises equipment portion of our service provider video connected devices business unit to frenchbased technicolor we will continue to refocus our investments in service provider video towards cloud security and softwarebased services 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

revenue in our service provider video product category decreased by 18  or 886 million  with the largest driver of the decline being a 21 or 812 million decrease in sales of our service provider video infrastructure products the revenue decline in service provider video infrastructure products which includes connected devices products was due primarily to lower sales of settop boxes 

data center 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our data center product category grew by 22  or 580 million  with sales growth of our cisco unified computing system products across all geographic segments and customer markets the increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing in both data center and cloud environments as current customers increase their data center buildouts and as new customers deploy these offerings 

to the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market we expect that in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

we continue to experience solid growth in our data center product category which grew by 27  or 566 million  with sales growth of our cisco unified computing system products across all geographic segments and customer markets the increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing in both data center and cloud environments as current customers increase their data center buildouts and as new customers deploy these offerings 

wireless 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our wireless product category increased by 11  or 249 million  driven by continued growth in sales of meraki products combined with continued strength in our 80211ac portfolio we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our wireless product category 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

we continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our wireless product category revenue in our wireless product category increased by 2  or 36 million  due to an increase in sales of meraki products which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 partially offset by lower sales of other wireless products 

security 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

revenue in our security product category was up 12  or 181 million  driven primarily by sales of sourcefire products and to a lesser extent by higher sales of our highend firewall products within our network security product portfolio this increase was partially offset by a slight decrease in revenue from our content security products due to lower sales of web and email security products we continue to increase the amount of deferred revenue and the proportion of recurring revenue related to our security product category 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

we continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our security product category revenue in our security product category was up 16  or 218 million  driven primarily by sales of sourcefire products which company we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and to a lesser degree by both higher sales of our highend firewall products within our network security product portfolio and slightly higher sales of our content security products 

other products 

we experienced a yearoveryear decrease in revenue in our other products category for fiscal 2015 due in large part to the decrease in sales of our other networking products the yearoveryear decrease in revenue in our other products category for fiscal 2014 was due in large part to the sale of our linksys product line in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 

service revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 3 and worldwide advanced services revenue increased by 6 driven by growth in subscription revenues technical support services revenue experienced relatively balanced growth across all geographic segments renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which in concert with new service offerings were the primary factors driving the revenue increases advanced services revenue which relates to consulting support services for specific customer network needs grew across all geographic segments 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

service revenue continued to experience slower growth than in prior fiscal years with varying levels of growth across our geographic segments worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 4 while worldwide advanced services revenue experienced 3 growth technical support services revenue experienced growth across all geographic segments renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which in concert with new service offerings were the primary factors driving the revenue increases advanced services revenue slightly declined in the americas segment but had solid growth in the emea and apjc segments due to growth in subscription revenues 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 



product gross margin 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2015  



1 productivity includes overall manufacturingrelated costs such as component costs warranty expense provision for inventory freight logistics shipment volume and other items not categorized elsewhere 

product gross margin increased by 25  percentage points compared with fiscal 2014  the increase in product gross margin was due to productivity improvements which were driven by value engineering efforts favorable component pricing continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations and lower warranty expense value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes the increase was also due to the 655 million charge to product cost of sales in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost to remediate issues with a supplier component in certain products sold in prior fiscal years and an associated 164 million favorable adjustment recorded in fiscal 2015 

additionally gross margin increased due to the mix of products sold the favorable product mix impact was due to revenue decreases from our relatively lower margin service provider video products and a revenue increase from certain of our higher margin core products partially offset by increased revenue from our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products the various factors contributing to the product gross margin increase were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets as well as the unfavorable impact of a 188 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2015 related to the rockstar patent portfolio see note 4b to the consolidated financial statements 

our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and could be adversely affected by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins such as cisco unified computing system products our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue and as was the case in fiscal 2015  fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  may be adversely affected by product pricing attributable to competitive factors additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain which in turn could negatively affect gross margin if any of the preceding factors that in the past have negatively impacted our gross margins arise in future periods our gross margins could continue to decline 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014  



product gross margin decreased by 23  percentage points compared with fiscal 2013 the decrease in product gross margin was driven by unfavorable impacts from product pricing which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets the decrease was also due in part to the supplier component remediation charge of 655 million to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2014 discussed above in addition the shift in the mix of products sold decreased our product gross margin primarily as a result of a revenue increase in our cisco unified computing system products and decreased revenue from our higher margin core products partially offset by decreased revenue from our service provider video products our product gross margin for fiscal 2014 was also negatively impacted by higher amortization expense of purchased intangible assets for further explanation of the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets see “amortization of purchased intangible assets” below 

these amounts were partially offset by productivity benefits and the absence of charges related to the tivo patent litigation settlement which we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the productivity benefits we experienced in fiscal 2014 were driven by value engineering efforts favorable component pricing and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations 

service gross margin 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

service gross margin percentage decreased by 20  percentage points for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  driven by increased cost impacts such as partner delivery costs headcountrelated costs and outside services headcountrelated costs increased due to continued investments in security and cloud managed services and higher variable compensation expense these cost impacts were partially offset by the resulting benefit to gross margin of higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 03  percentage points for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services the benefits to gross margin of increased sales volume were partially offset by increased cost impacts such as outside service costs partner delivery costs and headcountrelated costs 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



1   the unallocated corporate items for the years presented include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense significant litigation and other contingencies impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory charges related to asset impairments and restructurings and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

we experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our americas segment due to productivity improvements partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing the product mix was flat in this geographic segment as the impact of decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin service provider video products offset the increase in revenue from our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products 

the gross margin percentage decrease in our emea segment was due primarily to unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix the unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the overall gross margin in this segment 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage increased due to productivity improvements and a favorable mix impact partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing the favorable mix impact was driven by a decrease in revenue from our relatively lower margin service provider video products and an increase in revenue from certain of our higher margin core products   

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage increase due to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment partially offsetting this favorable impact to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable mix the unfavorable mix impact was driven by revenue increases in our cisco unified computing system products and lower sales of our higher margin core products partially offset by decreased revenue from our service provider video products   

the gross margin percentage decrease in our emea segment was due primarily to the unfavorable impacts from pricing as well as an unfavorable mix impact partially offset by productivity improvements in this geographic segment the unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our cisco unified computing system products 

our apjc segment gross margin percentage decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable impacts from pricing and also as a result of an unfavorable mix the unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our cisco unified computing system products partially offsetting these factors were impacts from productivity improvements and higher service gross margin in this geographic segment 

factors that may impact revenue and gross margin 

product revenue may continue to be affected by factors including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty that have resulted in reduced itrelated capital spending in certain segments within our enterprise service provider public sector and commercial markets changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions competition including pricefocused competitors from asia especially from china new product introductions sales cycles and product implementation cycles changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales variations in sales channels and final acceptance criteria of the product system or solution as specified by the customer sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our ngn routing sales and sales of certain products within our collaboration service provider video and data center product categories in addition service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including network design services and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition as we focus on new market opportunities customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support especially in certain emerging countries which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter revenue and operating results 

product revenue may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and internet businesses whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products adoption of new networking standards and financial difficulties experienced by our customers we may from time to time experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components resulting in delayed shipments to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter for additional factors that may impact product revenue see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs increased sales to our distributors generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a certain degree the timing of orders from our customers we recognize revenue for sales to our distributors generally based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 

product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products introduction of new products including products with priceperformance advantages and new business models for our offerings such as xaas our ability to reduce production costs entry into new markets including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures as a result of internal development or through acquisitions changes in distribution channels price competition including competitors from asia especially those from china changes in geographic mix of our product revenue the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals sales discounts increases in material or labor costs including sharebased compensation expense excess inventory and obsolescence charges warranty costs changes in shipment volume loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing effects of value engineering inventory holding charges and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals sharebased compensation expense and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business 

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



rd expenses 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in rd expenses for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  was primarily due to higher compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements efficiencies arising from our restructuring action announced in august 2014 also contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher contracted services and higher sharebased compensation expense 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

rd expenses increased for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  primarily due to compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme higher sharebased compensation expense and higher contracted services also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance and efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in august 2013 

sales and marketing expenses 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

sales and marketing expenses increased for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  due to higher headcountrelated expenses driven by increased variable compensation expense and higher discretionary spending partially offset by lower compensation expense from acquisitions 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  decreased slightly due to lower advertising expenses reductions in other discretionary spending and lower expenses in other areas such as depreciation expense these decreases were substantially offset by higher share based compensation expense and higher acquisition related costs 

ga expenses 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

ga expenses increased in fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  primarily due to increased variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance higher sharebased compensation expense and the timing of corporatelevel expenses corporatelevel expenses which tend to vary from period to period included operational infrastructure activities such as it project implementations which included investments in our global data center infrastructure and investments related to operational and financial systems 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

ga expenses decreased in fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  due to lower contracted services lower corporatelevel expenses and lower headcountrelated expenses the lower headcountrelated expenses were due to efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in august 2013 and also due to reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our lower financial performance 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2015  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 278 million  or 16  compared with fiscal 2014  in fiscal 2014  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 153 million  or 09  compared with fiscal 2013  

headcount 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in headcount of approximately 2200 employees in fiscal 2015  was due to headcount reductions from attrition and from our restructuring plan announced in august 2014 these headcount reductions were partially offset by headcount additions from targeted hiring in engineering and services and also by headcount additions from our recent acquisitions 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

our headcount decreased by approximately 1000 employees in fiscal 2014   the decrease was due to headcount reductions from attrition and from our workforce reduction plan announced in august 2013 these headcount reductions were partially offset by the increase in headcount from targeted hiring in engineering services sales and also by increased headcount from our recent acquisitions 

sharebased compensation expense 

the following table presents sharebased compensation expense in millions 



the increase in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  was due primarily to higher expense associated with performancebased restricted stock units and charges associated with severance arrangements with certain executives partially offset by lower expense related to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions 

the increase in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  was due primarily to sharebased compensation expense attributable to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions and higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets in millions 

amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  primarily due to the impairment charges of approximately 175 million  recorded in fiscal 2015 the impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value resulting from reductions in or the elimination of expected future cash flows associated with certain of our technology and iprd intangible assets 

amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

restructuring and other charges 

fiscal 2015 plan   

in connection with a restructuring action announced in august 2014 “fiscal 2015 plan” we incurred restructuring and other charges of 489 million  during fiscal 2015 which were related primarily to severance and other onetime termination benefits and other associated costs we expect this plan to be substantially completed during the first half of fiscal 2016 we plan to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in key growth areas of our business such as data center software security and cloud the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions were not material for the periods presented and are not expected to be material for future periods 

fiscal 2014 plan and fiscal 2011 plans   

in connection with a restructuring action announced in august 2013 “fiscal 2014 plan” we incurred restructuring and other charges of approximately 418 million  during fiscal 2014 which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction under the fiscal 2014 plan we completed the fiscal 2014 plan at the end of fiscal 2014 with regard to the fiscal 2011 plans see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we incurred restructuring and other charges of 105 million during fiscal 2013 which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction under these plans 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

for fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  operating income increased by 15  and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 21  percentage points the increase resulted from the following an increase in revenue a gross margin percentage increase driven in part by the 655 million supplier component remediation charge or 14 percentage points of fiscal 2014 revenue recorded in fiscal 2014  and higher compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme 

for fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 operating income decreased by 17 and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 32 percentage points the decrease resulted from the following a decrease in revenue a gross margin percentage decline driven in part by the 655 million supplier component remediation charge or 14 percentage points of fiscal 2014 revenue the 416 million compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme and an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the workforce reduction under the fiscal 2014 plan 

interest and other income loss net 

interest income expense net   the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

interest income increased in fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014 driven by an increase in our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments interest expense in fiscal 2015  as compared with the prior fiscal year increased slightly driven by additional interest expense due to the net increase in longterm debt in fiscal 2015  

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

interest income increased in fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 due to the increase in our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments   the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2014 as compared with the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of incremental interest rate swaps entered into during fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 this decrease was partially offset by additional interest expense due to the increase in longterm debt in fiscal 2014 

other income loss net     the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 



fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the decrease in total net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2015  compared with fiscal 2014  was primarily attributable to lower gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current period as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities 

the change in net gains losses on investments in privately held companies for the fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  was primarily due to a 126 million gain recorded in fiscal 2015 related to the reorganization of our investments in vce and lower losses related to this investment under the equity method we ceased accounting for vce under the equity method in october 2014 these favorable items were partially offset by higher impairment charges and lower realized gains from sales of various investments in privately held companies 

the change in other gains losses net in fiscal 2015  as compared with fiscal 2014  was driven by equity derivative impacts and higher donation expenses partially offset by net favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2015  

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the increase in total net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current period as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities 

the change in net losses on investments in privately held companies for the fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase of 40 million in our proportional share of losses from our vce joint venture partially offset by higher realized gains from various investments in privately held companies 

the change in other gains losses net in fiscal 2014 as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher gains on equity derivative instruments and lower donation expenses partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2014 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 198  for fiscal 2015  compared with 192  for fiscal 2014  the net 06  percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily due to a decrease in foreign income taxed at lower than us rates partially offset by an increase in us federal rd tax credit 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 192  for fiscal 2014  compared with 111  for fiscal 2013 the net 81  percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a nonrecurring net tax benefit of 794 million or 71 percentage points due to a tax settlement with the irs in fiscal 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments   the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2014  to fiscal 2015  was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of 126 billion  a net increase in debt of 45 billion  and the net issuance of common stock of 15 billion  pursuant to employee stock incentive and purchase plans these sources of cash were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of 43 billion  under the stock repurchase program cash dividends paid of 41 billion  capital expenditures of 12 billion  and net cash paid for acquisitions of 03 billion  

our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was 534 billion  and 474 billion  as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  respectively under current tax laws and regulations if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes the balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the united states as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  was 70 billion  and 47 billion  respectively 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

free cash flow and capital allocation     as part of our capital allocation strategy we intend to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue excess tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other required uses of cash including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in 

accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our board of directors 

accounts receivable net the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions and dso 



our accounts receivable net as of july 25 2015  increased by approximately 4  compared with the end of fiscal 2014  our dso as of july 25 2015  was flat compared with the end of fiscal 2014  as factors that drive dso such as shipment linearity and collections were similar for the periods presented 

inventory supply chain   the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions except annualized inventory turns 



inventory as of july 25 2015  increased by 2  from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2014  and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased   by approximately 2  on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 1  compared with the end of fiscal 2014  we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts 

our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers manufactured finished goods consist primarily of buildtoorder and buildtostock products 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees  we measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue as of july 25 2015  our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows in millions 



financing receivables   financing receivables less unearned income increased by 4  compared with the end of fiscal 2014  the change was primarily due to an 11  increase in financed service contracts and other and a 5  increase in loan receivables partially offset by a 4  decrease in lease receivables we provide financing to certain enduser customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products services and networking solutions these financing arrangements include leases financed service contracts and loans arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets lease receivables include salestype and directfinancing leases we also provide certain qualified customers financing for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 

financing guarantees   in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms the volume of channel partner financing was 259 billion  246 billion  and 238 billion  in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013  respectively these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements the balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was 12 billion  as of each of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed 

deferred revenue related to financing receivables and guarantees   the majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts the majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts which primarily relates to technical support services is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed a portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met 

borrowings 

senior notes   the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 



1 in june 2015 we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of 50 billion  

interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium interest is payable quarterly on the floatingrate notes we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 25 2015  

we repaid the fixedrate notes 290 due on november 17 2014 for an aggregate principal amount of 500 million  upon maturity 

we repaid the floatingrate notes due on september 3 2015 for an aggregate principal amount of 850 million upon maturity 

other debt   other debt as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements    the amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was 4 million   and 12 million  as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  respectively 

commercial paper   in fiscal 2011 we established a shortterm debt financing program of up to 30 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes we had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  

credit facility   on may 15 2015 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on may 15 2020 any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the highest of a the federal funds rate plus 050 b bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or c libor or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the administrative agent “eurocurrency rate” for an interest period of one month plus 100 or ii the eurocurrency rate plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc provided that in no event will the eurocurrency rate be less than zero the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that it maintains an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 

we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion andor extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to may 15 2022 we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

this credit facility replaces our prior credit facility that was entered into on february 17 2012 which was terminated in connection with its entering into the new credit facility 

deferred revenue   the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



deferred product revenue increased 21  primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription and software revenue arrangements and also to a lesser extent to an increase in shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria as of july 25 2015  the product categories of collaboration security and wireless were the key contributors to the increase the increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2015  was driven by the timing of multiyear arrangements an increase in customers paying technical support service contracts over time and the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue 

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 25 2015  in millions 



operating leases   for more information on our operating leases see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers   we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” as of july 25 2015  the liability for these purchase commitments was 156 million  and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 

other purchase obligations   other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt   the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities   other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 1876 million   and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 246 million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

insieme networks inc    in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we made an investment in insieme an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market as set forth in the agreement between cisco and insieme this investment included 100 million  of funding and a license to certain of our technology immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below we owned approximately 83  of insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of insieme in our consolidated financial statements in connection with this investment we entered into a putcall option agreement that provided us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in insieme in addition the noncontrolling interest holders could require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we exercised our call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in insieme the acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments which will be determined using agreedupon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of insieme’s products during fiscal 2015 and 2014  we recorded compensation expense of 207 million  and 416 million  respectively related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that were earned or expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders continued vesting and changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense in future periods based on the terms of the agreement we have determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately 843 million  which includes the 623 million  that has been expensed to date net of forfeitures the milestone payments to the extent earned are expected to be paid primarily during the first half of each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 

other funding commitments   we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 205 million  as of july 25 2015  compared with 255 million  as of july 26 2014  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers these privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 25 2015  there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

securities lending 

we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis the average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2015  and 2014 was 04 billion   and 15 billion  respectively we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  we had no outstanding securities lending transactions we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities   we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july 25 2015  our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july 25 2015  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers as of july 25 2015  approximately 65  of our fixed income securities balance consisted of us government and us government agency securities we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 bps or minus 150 bps was relevant the hypothetical fair values as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  are as follows in millions 

  





financing receivables   as of july 25 2015  our financing receivables had a carrying value of 83 billion  compared with 81 billion  as of july 26 2014  as of july 25 2015  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt     as of july 25 2015  we had 253 billion  in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which consisted of 33 billion  floatingrate notes and 220 billion  fixedrate notes the carrying amount of the senior notes was 254 billion  and the related fair value based on market prices was 266 billion  as of july 25 2015  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 114 billion  of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 04 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt that is not hedged 

equity price risk 

the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard  poor’s 500 index or nasdaq composite index these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

publicly traded equity securities   the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio excluding hedged equity securities if any potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 20 and 30 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of july 25 2015  and july 26 2014  are as follows in millions 





investments in privately held companies   we have also invested in privately held companies these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method as of july 25 2015  the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 897 million  compared with 899 million  at july 26 2014  some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 



we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies as was the case during fiscal 2015 such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2015  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 278 million  or 16  compared with fiscal 2014  in fiscal 2014  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by approximately 153 million  or 09  as compared with fiscal 2013  to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities 



we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes

we conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography our business is organized into the following three geographic segments the americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific japan and china apjc for revenue and other information regarding these segments see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

we were incorporated in california in december 1984 and our headquarters are in san jose california the mailing address of our headquarters is 170 west tasman drive san jose california 951341706 and our telephone number at that location is 408 5264000 our website is wwwciscocom through a link on the investor relations section of our website we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act all such filings are available free of charge the information posted on our website is not incorporated into this report 

as part of our business focus on the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it our products and services are designed to help our customers use technology to address their business imperatives and opportunities—driving growth improving productivity reducing costs mitigating risk and gaining a competitive advantage we deliver networking products and solutions designed to simplify and secure customers’ network infrastructures and help them connect more effectively with their key stakeholders including their customers prospects business partners suppliers and employees we continually focus on delivering products and solutions that leverage the network to most effectively address market transitions in recent periods we have developed and delivered products and services to address the transitions driven by virtualization cloud software collaboration and video our products and technologies are grouped into the following categories switching nextgeneration network ngn routing service provider video collaboration data center wireless security and other products we believe that integrating products and services into architectures and solutions helps our customers reduce their operational complexity increase their agility and reduce their total cost of network ownership 

network architectures developed from our core routing and switching technologies are evolving to accommodate the demands of increasing numbers of users network applications and new networkrelated markets these new markets are a natural extension of our core business and have emerged as the network has become the platform for provisioning integrating and delivering an everincreasing array of itbased products and services 

strategy and focus areas 

our strategy is to deliver the integrated architectures solutions and outcomes to help our customers grow manage costs and mitigate risk we see our customers in almost every industry becoming increasingly reliant on technology—and specifically the network—to meet their business objectives and compete successfully in the market   

our focus continues to be on capitalizing on market transitions to maintain leadership in our core markets and to enter new markets where the network is foundational we believe this focus best positions us to become a more relevant and trusted partner to our customers and to expand our share of our customers’ it spending we are focused on driving the innovation speed agility and efficiencies in our company required to deliver leading technology solutions for our customers and shareholder value for our investors   

over the last few years we have been working to transform our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions as well as to meet customers business outcomes as a part of this transformation we are making changes to how we are organized and how we deliver our technology we believe these changes enable us to better meet our customers’ requirements and help them stay ahead of market transitions   

as part of the ongoing transformation of our business we continue to drive product transitions in our core business including the introduction of nextgeneration products with better priceperformance and architectural advantages compared with both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors we believe that many of these product transitions are gaining momentum based on the strong yearoveryear product revenue growth in certain of the new products but we do continue to manage through the transitions of several of our existing key product platforms and we continue to see the impact thereof on our overall core performance going forward a focus on utilizing our core products within the integrated solutions that we provide customers to meet their business outcomes will be a critical part of our strategy 

in our view our routing and switching product leadership has been foundational to our success in the data center market we initially captured the market transition to converged infrastructure bringing together networking compute and storage into one integrated architecture with the unified computing system ucs we continue to expand the opportunity relating to ucs including incorporating the ucs solution within our solutions for cloud and virtualization we believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market is accelerating due to changing technology trends that we believe depend on an intelligent network—trends such as network virtualization cloud and the increased demands of applications to take advantage of our position in our customers network infrastructure we are implementing strategies and offering strong products to address each of these major transitions including 

 we also remain focused on continued investment in our services portfolio tightly integrated with our product portfolio to deliver the solutions our customers want a few examples of new service offerings include security services cloud and managed services and consulting services 

among our other areas of focus are

market transitions 

we continue to seek to capitalize on market transitions as sources of future revenue opportunities as part of the continued transformation of our business and we believe market transitions in the it industry are occurring with greater frequency market transitions relating to the network are becoming in our view more significant as intelligent networks have moved from being a cost center issue—where the focus is on reducing network operating costs and increasing networkrelated productivity—to becoming a platform for revenue generation business agility and competitive advantage 

we believe that that the next wave of dramatic internet growth will come through the confluence of people process data and things which we refer to as the ioe we believe that ioe by bringing “everything” online will create significant opportunities for businesses governments and other organizations to obtain greater value from networked connections ioe is being driven by several factors along with the anticipated proliferation in the number of networkconnected things we believe customers are seeing that significant technology trends and advances make it possible to realize more value from connectedness ioe also reflects the ability to create intelligence—and capture intelligence faster—from these connections which is why we believe that ioe has the potential to be a pivotal market transition that can offer significant economic and societal benefits on a global basis helping our customers take advantage of ioe in our view requires enabling them to address several of the other major technology transitions driving the ioe such as virtualization application centricity cloud and mobility we believe our customers need a new model for it that addresses the requirements that these transitions place on it we call this model that unifies infrastructure platform and applications fast it by delivering architectures and solutions based on fast it we aim to help our customers reduce complexity accelerate service deployment and increase security in a world that is increasingly virtualized application centric cloudbased and mobile 

virtualizationapplication centricity      we are also focusing on a market transition involving the move toward more programmable flexible and virtual networks sometimes called software defined networking or sdn this transition is focused on moving from a hardwarecentric approach for networking to a virtualized network environment that is designed to enable flexible applicationdriven customization of network infrastructures we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine applicationspecific integrated circuits asics with hardware and software elements together to meet customers’ total cost of ownership quality security scalability and experience requirements in our view there is no single architecture that supports all customer requirements in this area 

we believe the promise of sdn is to enable more open and programmable network infrastructure we are addressing this opportunity with a unique strategy and set of solutions that is designed to address the application demands transition and offers a holistic approach to the future of networking that responds automatically to the needs of applications we introduced and began shipping our application centric infrastructure aci which delivers centralized applicationdriven policy automation management and visibility of both physical and virtual environments as a single system aci is comprised of our nexus 9000 portfolio of switches enhanced versions of our nxos operating system and the application policy infrastructure controller apic which provides a central place to configure automate and manage an entire network based on the needs of applications 

cloud      our intercloud strategy seeks to leverage our application centric infrastructure together with our partners to deliver we believe the first global open network of highly secure hybrid cloud environments we believe that customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique recognizing that we offer a solution to federated private hybrid and public clouds that enables them to move their cloud workloads across heterogeneous private and public clouds with the necessary policy security and management features with our intercloud solution we aim to build upon the leadership we have established in the private cloud market and as a cloud infrastructure provider 

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements

other products 

our other products category primarily consists of certain emerging technologies and other networking products 

service 

in addition to our product offerings we provide a broad range of service offerings including technical support services and advanced services 

technical support services help our customers ensure their products operate efficiently remain available and benefit from the most uptodate system and application software that we have developed these services help customers protect their network investments manage risk and minimize downtime for systems running missioncritical applications a key example of this is our cisco smart services offering which leverages the intelligence from cisco’s millions of devices and customer connections to protect and optimize network investment for our customers and partners 

advanced services are part of a comprehensive program that is focused on providing responsive preventive and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs the advanced services program supports networking devices applications solutions and complete infrastructures our service and support strategy is focused on capitalizing on increased globalization and we believe this strategy along with our architectural approach has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors 

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 or more of our revenue our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise service provider commercial and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we strive to take advantage of the networkasaplatform strategy to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide they include regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also group media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased services and contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our routing and switching optical security video mobility and network management products systems and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the scale and complexity of their networks which requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

commercial 

generally we define commercial businesses as companies with fewer than 1000 employees the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market are served by a combination of our direct salesforce and our channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or companies with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain these smaller companies within the commercial market are primarily served by our channel partners 

public sector 

public sector entities include federal governments state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector entities have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector entities through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2014  our worldwide sales and marketing departments consisted of 24740  employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in 94 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors hold inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and software maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



for additional information regarding these financing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

product backlog 

our product backlog at july 26 2014  the last day of fiscal 2014  was approximately 54 billion  compared with product backlog of approximately 49 billion  at july 27 2013  the last day of fiscal 2013  the product backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our product backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the three components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as our “build buy and partner” approach the foregoing is a way of describing how we strive to innovate we can internally develop or build our own innovative solutions we can acquire or buy companies with innovative technologies and we can partner with companies to jointly develop andor resell product technologies and innovations the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all of the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services we work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions investments and alliances to summarize we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking and communications products and services 

 acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk 

factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies with which we have or recently had strategic alliances include the following 

accenture ltd att inc cap gemini sa citrix systems inc emc corporation fujitsu limited intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa johnson controls inc microsoft corporation netapp inc nokia siemens networks oracle corporation red hat inc sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy services ltd vce company llc “vce” vmware inc wipro limited and others   

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include alcatellucent amazon web services llc arista networks inc arris group inc aruba networks inc avaya inc brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd citrix systems inc dell inc lm ericsson telephone company extreme networks inc f5 networks inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc microsoft corporation motorola solutions inc palo alto networks inc polycom inc riverbed technology inc ruckus wireless inc symantec corporation and vmware inc among others   

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success   

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of switching ngn routing service provider video collaboration wireless data center security and other product technologies for this purpose our research and development expenditures were  63 billion  59 billion  and 55 billion  in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of increased focus include but are not limited to our core routing and switching products collaboration and products related to the data center our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge such as ip version 6 nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time defined as less than one year 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses” 

employees 

employees are summarized as follows 



1   cost of sales includes manufacturing support services and training 

we consider the relationships with our employees to be positive competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include   





































as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 













the global macroeconomic environment and recovery from the downturn has been challenging and inconsistent instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding the us federal budget including the effect of the sequestration beginning in 2013 global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example sales in several of our emerging countries decreased in recent periods including fiscal 2014 and we expect that this weakness will continue for at least several quarters 

in addition reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect customers’ perception of the products of it companies which design and manufacture products in the united states trust and confidence in us as an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the us government could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the united states and could have an adverse effect on our operating results 

we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key growth areas as well as maintaining leadership in routing switching and services and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we expect to realign and dedicate resources into key growth areas such as data center virtualization software security and cloud while also focusing on maintaining leadership in routing switching and services however the return on our investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty 

our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in fiscal 2014 on a yearoveryear basis our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters 

recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter revenue and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins declined in prior periods including fiscal 2014 and may continue to decline and be adversely affected by numerous factors including   



































changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as data center collaboration and service provider video in addition to longer sales cycles at various times in the past including fiscal 2014 we experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers sometimes lasting over extended periods of time as market conditions have fluctuated we expect that the weakness we experienced in fiscal 2014 will continue for at least several quarters sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is generally recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 









in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in key growth areas for example as products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from companies who develop networking products based on commoditized hardware referred to as white box hardware to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market 

as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 busines s of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 



















we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 





a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available 

in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or the reramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future   







manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multipleparty collaborative interaction would demand and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased 

use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it for example in fiscal 2009 we launched our cisco unified computing system ucs our nextgeneration enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing network storage access and virtualization resources in a single system which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center while our cisco ucs offering remains a significant focus area for us several market transitions are also shaping our strategies and investments 

one such market transition we are focusing on is the move towards more programmable flexible and virtual networks in our view this evolution is in its very early stages and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine asics hardware and software elements together other examples include our focus on the ioe market transition a potentially significant transition in the it industry and a transition in cloud where we have announced plans to architect the cisco intercloud solution 

the process of developing new technology including technology related to more programmable flexible and virtual networks and technology related to other market transitions including ioe and cloud is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such as for example networking products based on “white box” hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in a timely fashion offerings to address other transitions or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours 

furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our other product categories and key growth areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction or restructuring costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

in august 2014 as part of our strategy of continuing to invest in growth innovation and talent while also managing costs and driving efficiencies we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6000 employees representing approximately 8 percent of our global workforce we expect to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the restructuring 

plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service and marketing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key growth areas such as data center virtualization software security and cloud and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in routing switching and services we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated transition to ioe and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure including spending or investment related to ioe we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 















acquisitions may also cause us to   



















mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities and key growth areas we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence for example as we add direct selling capabilities globally to meet changing customer demands we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income for example in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pretax charge of 655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries we also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners although sales in several of our emerging countries decreased in recent periods including in fiscal 2014 several of our emerging countries generally have been relatively fast growing and we have announced plans to expand our commitments and expectations in certain of those countries we expect that the weakness we experienced in recent periods in several emerging countries will continue for at least several quarters our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states including impacts from the us federal budget including the effect of the sequestration beginning in 2013 global central bank monetary policy issues related to the political relationship between the united states and other countries which can affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the united states and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following   















we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries 

we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the 

united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligations see note 12g to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand 

for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect to an alleged underpayment of income taxes social taxes interest and penalties by a brazilian distributor the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2008 and the related asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to approximately 389 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes approximately 13 billion  for interest and approximately 17 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 26 2014  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association of 34 countries including the united states is contemplating changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these contemplated changes if finalized and adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 208 billion  that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2014 through 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 30 billion  and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 26 2014   the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually except 235 billion  of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our whollyowned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances

brazil      brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in addition to claims asserted by the brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years tax authorities from the brazilian state of sao paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect to an alleged underpayment of income taxes social taxes interest and penalties by a brazilian distributor 

the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2008 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to approximately 389 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes approximately 13 billion  for interest and approximately 17 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 26 2014  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013—financial performance 

total revenue decreased by 3  as compared with fiscal 2013 within the total revenue change product revenue decreased 5  and service revenue increased 4  total gross margin decreased by 17  percentage points driven by unfavorable impacts from pricing and mix partially offset by productivity improvements and also due to the 655 million charge to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost of remediation of issues with memory components in certain products sold in prior fiscal years despite a slight yearoveryear decline in absolute dollars research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 11  percentage points as a percentage of revenue due to the decline in revenue operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 32  percentage points diluted earnings per share decreased by 20  from the prior year driven by a 21  decrease in net income the decrease in net income in fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 was also attributable to net tax benefits in fiscal 2013 related to a settlement with the irs and reinstatement of the us federal rd tax credit 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013—business summary 

in fiscal 2014  revenue decreased by 15 billion  as compared with fiscal 2013 revenue from the americas decreased by 09 billion  driven by lower product revenue in most countries in this segment including the united states while we experienced relative stability across europe emea revenue decreased 02 billion  led by product revenue declines in russia as well as various other countries in this segment revenue in our apjc segment decreased 04 billion  led by product revenue declines in japan and india the weakness we encountered in emerging countries throughout the world in the later part of fiscal 2013 continued during fiscal 2014 the emerging countries of brazil russia india china and mexico “bricm” in the aggregate experienced an   11 product revenue decline   with declines across all of our customer markets we believe that the product revenue declines in many of these emerging countries were driven by the impact of economic and geopolitical challenges in these countries while we saw some improvement in our business momentum in emerging countries in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014 we experienced a decline in our business momentum in these countries during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 

in fiscal 2014  product revenue declined across all customer markets with the most significant decline in the service provider market within the service provider market the largest impacts came from the continued product revenue decline in our service provider video category and the ongoing decline of product revenue in the emerging countries 

from a product category perspective the product revenue decrease of 5  yearoveryear was driven in large part by the lower product revenue within our core routing and switching product categories while we saw improvement in business momentum with respect to highend routers during the second half of fiscal 2014 there was only a limited revenue contribution related to some of our recently introduced products as product transitions in this area are still in their early stages the effects of these product transitions combined with other challenges led to a decrease in ngn routing revenue of 7  we also experienced a 5  decrease in revenue from our switching products the other major product categories experienced revenue changes ranging from an 18  decrease in service provider video to a 27  increase in data center the decrease in revenue from our service provider video products was driven largely by a decrease in revenue from sales of settop boxes partially offsetting the decline in product revenue was an increase in service revenue service revenue increased by 4  reflecting continued slower growth compared with prior years which we believe was attributable to the impact of the declines in product revenue in recent periods 

as we continue to focus on investing in growth innovation and talent while managing costs and driving efficiencies we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6000 employees representing approximately 8 of our global workforce we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key growth areas such as data center software security and cloud 

in summary while we saw some improved business momentum in the second half of fiscal 2014 we experienced many challenges during fiscal 2014 including reduced spending by our service provider customers weakness in emerging countries the impact of product transitions and a conservative approach to itrelated capital spending by customers we expect that the challenges in the emerging countries the service provider customer market and product transitions in switching and ngn routing may continue for at least the next several quarters 

fourth quarter snapshot 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2013  total revenue was flat within the total revenue change product revenue declined by 2  and service revenue increased by 5  with regard to our geographic segment performance on a yearoveryear basis revenue in the americas and in emea both decreased by 1  while we experienced a slight increase by 1  in our apjc segment total gross margin increased by 07  percentage points primarily due to the tivo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 10  percentage points operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 10  percentage points primarily as a result of higher restructuring and other charges and also the impact of our revenue decrease diluted earnings per share increased by 2  from the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in our diluted share count 

strategy and focus areas 

our strategy is to deliver the integrated architectures solutions and outcomes to help our customers grow manage costs and mitigate risk we see our customers in almost every industry becoming increasingly reliant on technology—and specifically the network—to meet their business objectives and compete successfully in the market   

our focus continues to be on capitalizing on market transitions to maintain leadership in our core markets and to enter new markets where the network is foundational we believe this focus best positions us to become a more relevant and trusted partner to our customers and to expand our share of our customers’ it spending we are focused on driving the innovation speed agility and efficiencies in our company required to deliver leading technology solutions for our customers and shareholder value for our investors   

over the last few years we have been working to transform our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions as well as to meet customers business outcomes as a part of this transformation we are making changes to how we are organized and how we deliver our technology we believe these changes enable us to better meet our customers’ requirements and help them stay ahead of market transitions

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  in millions except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso and annualized inventory turns 



our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2014  was 54 billion  or 12  of fiscal 2014  total revenue compared with 49 billion  at the end of fiscal 2013  or 10  of fiscal 2013  total revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met when a sale involves multiple deliverables such as sales of products that include services the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met for hosting arrangements we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the subscription period while usage revenue is recognized based on utilization software subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term upon delivery of the first product and commencement of the term 

the amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and if so our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables according to the accounting guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  we use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those units when available we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately 80 of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15 of the median rates when vsoe does not exist we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multipledeliverable arrangements under the selling price hierarchy thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of others in our markets and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers in determining esp we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering companyspecific factors such as geographies competitive landscape internal costs profitability objectives pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 

some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition  

as our business and offerings evolve over time our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly which could result in changes in selling prices including both vsoe and esp in subsequent periods there were no material impacts during fiscal 2014  nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe tpe or esp 

revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements service support and other factors financing arrangements may include salestype directfinancing and operating leases loans and guarantees of thirdparty financing our deferred revenue for products was 45 billion  and 40 billion  as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  respectively technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed which typically is from one to three years advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance our deferred revenue for services was 96 billion  and 94 billion  as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  respectively 

we make sales to distributors which we refer to as twotier systems of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs if actual credits received by our distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

allowances for receivables and sales returns 

the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions except percentages 



the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates which are published by major thirdparty creditrating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts if a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis we consider historical experience credit quality and age of receivable balances and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis we use expected default frequency rates published by a major thirdparty creditrating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation are complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our operating results both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 

a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates the reserve for future sales returns as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  was 135 million  and 119 million  respectively and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

our inventory balance was 16 billion  and 15 billion  as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  respectively inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory as of july 26 2014  the liability for these purchase commitments was 162 million  compared with 172 million  as of july 27 2013  and was included in other current liabilities 

our provision for inventory was 67 million  114 million  and 115 million  for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012  respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 124 million  106 million  and 151 million  in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012  respectively if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast 

loss contingencies and product warranties 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we have recorded a liability for the expected remediation cost for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010 in february 2014 on the basis of the growing number of failures as described in note 12 f to the consolidated financial statements we decided to expand our approach which resulted in an additional charge to product cost of sales of 655 million being recorded for the second quarter of fiscal 2014 estimating this liability is complex and subjective and if we experience changes in a number of underlying assumptions and estimates such as a change in claims compared with our expectations or if the cost of servicing these claims is different than expected our estimated liability may be impacted 

our liability for product warranties included in other current liabilities was 446 million  as of july 26 2014  compared with 402 million  as of july 27 2013  our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 

the provision for product warranties during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012  was 704 million  649 million  and 617 million  respectively if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our profitability could be adversely affected 

fair value measurements 

our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities collectively are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of 453 billion  as of july 26 2014  compared with 427 billion  as of july 27 2013  our fixed income investment portfolio as of july 26 2014  consisted primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments it encompasses three classes of investments level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and modelderived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 

our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data we use inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities we use such pricing data as the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2014 and 2013  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 

the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 26 2014    level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of july 26 2014  

otherthantemporary impairments 

we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these securities to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected we consider all available information including past events current conditions the remaining payment terms of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of underlying collateral 

for publicly traded equity securities we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

for fiscal 2014  impairment charges of 11 million on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were recognized in earnings while there were no such impairment charges in fiscal 2013 and 2012 our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

we also have investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages as of july 26 2014  our investments in privately held companies were 899 million  compared with 833 million  as of july 27 2013  and were included in other assets we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and we make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 23 million 33 million and 23 million  in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012  respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  was 242 billion  and 219 billion  respectively the increase in goodwill for fiscal 2014  was due in large part to our acquisition of sourcefire inc in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012  for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2014  the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 320 billion for the americas 220 billion for emea and 162 billion for apjc during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014  we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts there were no impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were 12 million  during fiscal 2012  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits domestic manufacturing deductions tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 192  111  and 208  in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012  respectively 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations treaties or interpretations thereof including possible changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association comprised of 34 countries including the united states is contemplating changes to numerous longstanding tax principles these contemplated changes if finalized and adopted by countries will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

results of operations 

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013   

for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  total revenue decreased by 3  product revenue decreased by 5  while service revenue increased by 4  the decrease in product revenue reflected declines across all geographic segments as well as across all customer markets service revenues experienced slower growth in our americas and apjc geographic segments while we experienced slightly faster growth in the emea segment 

across our geographic segments product revenue for most of our emerging countries experienced a decline the emerging countries of bricm in the aggregate experienced an   11 product revenue decline   with declines across all of our customer markets 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations our revenue in fiscal 2014 may have been adversely affected by the depreciation of the local currency relative to the us dollar in certain emerging countries although such indirect effects are difficult to measure as noted 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and budgetdriven reductions in spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multipleelement arrangements the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment as has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time customers require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support and these activities may occur in future periods which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012   

for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  total revenue increased by 6  within total revenue growth product revenue increased by 5  while service revenue increased by 9  our product and service revenue totals reflected revenue growth across each of our geographic segments the revenue increase was primarily due to the following the solid performance of our service offerings our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 and increased demand for our data center and wireless products 

product revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



americas 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

product revenue in the americas segment decreased by 5  led by a significant decline in the service provider market and to a lesser extent declines in the public sector and commercial markets product revenue declined in the us public sector market led by lower sales to the us federal government    from a country perspective product revenue decreased by 5 in the united states 10 in canada and 13 in brazil partially offset by an increase of 2 in mexico 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  product revenue in the americas segment increased by 7  the increase in product revenue was across most of our customer markets in the americas segment led by solid growth in the service provider and commercial markets and to a lesser degree growth in the enterprise market the growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due in large part to our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 within the americas segment we experienced a product revenue decline in the public sector market driven by lower sales to the public sector in the united states from a country perspective product revenue increased by 9 in the united states 13 in brazil and 7 in mexico during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we experienced some weakness in our business momentum in certain countries within latin america 

emea 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

product revenue in the emea segment decreased by 4  led by a decline in the service provider market and to a lesser extent declines in the enterprise and public sector markets product revenue from emerging countries within emea decreased by 11 led by a 24 decrease in russia product revenue for the remainder of emea which is primarily composed of countries in western europe declined by 2 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2013  we experienced a continuation of many of the macroeconomic challenges we faced in emea in fiscal 2012 while we did see some improvements in most of the european economy as the fiscal year progressed we continued to see weakness in southern europe throughout fiscal 2013 for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  product revenue in the emea segment was flat as growth in the commercial service provider and public sector markets was offset by a decline in the enterprise market the growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due to our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 from a country perspective product revenue increased by 1 in the united kingdom 11 in russia 4 in switzerland and 3 in spain these increases were offset by product revenue declines of 3 in each of germany and france and 13 in the netherlands product revenue for italy was flat year over year 

apjc 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

product revenue in the apjc segment decreased by 7  led by declines in the service provider and enterprise markets and to a lesser extent a decline in the commercial market we continued to experience declines in many of the emerging countries within this segment most notably in india which experienced a yearoveryear product revenue decline of 15 other countries that contributed to the weakness in this segment included japan australia and china which experienced yearoveryear product revenue declines of 11 7 and 6 respectively 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  product revenue in the apjc segment increased by 3  we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial and service provider markets and to a lesser degree in the public sector market the growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due primarily to our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 from a country perspective product revenue increased by 3 in australia 34 in india and 10 in south korea these increases were partially offset by product revenue declines of 5 in china and 7 in japan reflecting certain challenges that we faced in these countries during portions of fiscal 2013 most notably in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

product revenue by groups of similar products 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes our product categories consist of the following categories with subcategories in parentheses switching fixed switching modular switching and storage ngn routing highend routers midrange and lowend routers and other ngn routing products service provider video infrastructure video software and solutions collaboration unified communications cisco telepresence and conferencing data center wireless security and other products the other products category consists primarily of   emerging technology products and other networking products 

the following table presents revenue for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 



switching 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

revenue in our switching product category decreased by 5  or 711 million  driven by a 12 or 656 million decrease in revenue from our modular switches revenue from our modular switches decreased due to lower sales of cisco catalyst 6000 series switches we also experienced a 3 decrease in sales of storage products within this category revenue from our lan fixedconfiguration switches was relatively flat year over year as lower sales of most of our fixedconfiguration cisco catalyst series switches and fixedconfiguration cisco nexus series switches were offset by the continued adoption of cisco catalyst 3850 series switches and cisco nexus 6000 series switches 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

product revenue in our switching category increased by 1  or 133 million  as higher sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches and storage products sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches increased by 4 or 347 million while sales of modular switches decreased by 1 or approximately 76 million the increase in sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches was primarily due to higher sales of cisco nexus series switches partially offset by sales declines in certain of our cisco catalyst product families sales of modular switches decreased due to lower sales of cisco catalyst 6000 series switches partially offset by higher sales in cisco nexus 7000 series switches product revenue in the switching category was also negatively impacted by a 24 decrease in sales of storage products 

ngn routing 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the decrease in revenue in our ngn routing product category of 7  or 581 million  was driven by a 6 or 278 million decrease in revenue from highend router products a 9 or 249 million decrease in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products and an 8 or 54 million decrease in revenue from other ngn routing products revenue from our highend products decreased d ue to lower sales of cisco crs3 carrier routing system products and our legacy highend router products partially offset by increased sales of our cisco aggregation services routers asr edge products the decrease in revenue from our midrange and lowend router products was driven by lower sales of our cisco integrated services routers isr products revenue from other ngn routing products decreased due to lower sales of certain optical networking products 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

sales in our ngn routing product category decreased by 2  or 152 million  driven by a 3 or 141 million decrease in sales of highend router products and an 8 or 58 million decrease in sales of other ngn routing products these decreases were partially offset by a 2 or 47 million increase in sales of our midrange and lowend router products within the highend router product category we experienced lower sales of our cisco crs1 and crs3 carrier routing system products and our legacy highend router products partially offset by continued adoption of our cisco asr products higher sales in our midrange and lowend router products were driven by the continued adoption of our cisco isr platform the decline in sales of other ngn routing products was due to decreased sales of certain other routing and optical networking products 

service provider video 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

revenue in our service provider video product category decreased by 18  or 886 million  with the largest driver of the decline being a 21 or 812 million decrease in sales of our service provider video infrastructure products the revenue decline in service provider video infrastructure products which includes connected devices products was due primarily to lower sales of settop boxes 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

our service provider video products category grew by 25  or 986 million  due primarily to the acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 higher revenue from our service provider video infrastructure products also contributed to the increase the increase in sales of our service provider video infrastructure products was primarily due to increased sales of settop boxes 

collaboration 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

we continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our collaboration product category overall revenue in our collaboration product category decreased by 6  or 222 million  primarily due to decreased revenue from our cisco telepresence and unified communications products driven by weakness in endpoint products such as phones these decreases were partially offset by higher revenue from our conferencing products 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

sales of collaboration products decreased by 6  or 238 million  primarily due to a decline in sales of cisco telepresence systems and to a lesser degree a decline in sales of unified communications products lower public sector spending in the united states as well as demand weakness in europe were significant drivers of the decline in sales of cisco telepresence systems we also experienced a decline in sales of unified communications products which was due primarily to lower sales of unified communications infrastructure products as a result of our sales emphasis on shifting towards products with recurring revenue streams 

data center 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

we continue to experience solid growth in our data center product category which grew by 27  or 566 million  with sales growth of our cisco unified computing system products across all geographic segments and customer markets the increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing in both data center and cloud environments as current customers increase their data center buildouts and as new customers deploy these offerings 

to the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market we expect that in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

we experienced strong growth in our data center product category which grew by 60  or 776 million  with strong sales growth of our cisco unified computing system products across all geographic segments and customer markets the increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing with our products for both data center and cloud environments as current customers increase their data center buildouts and as new customers deploy these offerings 

wireless 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

we continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our wireless product category revenue in our wireless product category increased by 2  or 37 million  due to an increase in sales of meraki products which we acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 partially offset by lower sales of other wireless products 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

sales of wireless products increased by 31  or 531 million  this increase reflects the continued customer adoption of and migration to the unified access architecture of the cisco unified wireless network and also reflects increased sales of new products in this category as well as sales of products related to our acquisition of meraki 

security 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

we continue to increase the proportion of recurring revenue in our security product category revenue in our security product category was up 16  or 218 million  driven primarily by sales of sourcefire products which company we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and to a lesser degree by both higher sales of our highend firewall products within our network security product portfolio and slightly higher sales of our content security products 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

sales of security products were flat as higher sales in highend firewall products within our network  security product portfolio were offset by lower sales of our content security products 

other products 

we experienced a yearoveryear decrease in revenue in our other products category for both fiscal 2014 and 2013 due in large part to the sale of our linksys product line in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 

service revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

service revenue continued to experience slower growth than in prior fiscal years with varying levels of growth across our geographic segments worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 4 while worldwide advanced services revenue experienced 3 growth technical support service revenue experienced growth across all geographic segments renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which in concert with new service offerings were the primary factors driving the revenue increases advanced services revenue which relates to consulting support services for specific customer network needs slightly declined in the americas segment but had solid growth in the emea and apjc segments due to growth in subscription revenues 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

service revenue experienced solid growth across all of our geographic segments worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 6 and worldwide advanced services experienced 16 revenue growth technical support service experienced growth across all of our geographic segments led by growth in our americas segment renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which in concert with new service offerings were the primary factors driving these increases we experienced revenue growth in advanced services across all geographic segments led by growth in the americas segment advanced services revenue growth was driven by solid growth in both transaction and subscription revenues

the decrease in product gross margin was driven by unfavorable impacts from product pricing which were driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments and customer markets the decrease was also due in part to the charge of 655 million to product cost of sales recorded in fiscal 2014 related to the expected cost of remediation of issues with memory components in certain products sold in prior fiscal years in addition the shift in the mix of products sold decreased our product gross margin primarily as a result of a revenue increase in our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products and decreased revenue from our higher margin core products partially offset by decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin service provider video products our product gross margin for fiscal 2014 was also negatively impacted by higher amortization expense of purchased intangible assets for further explanation of the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets see “amortization of purchased intangible assets” below 

these amounts were partially offset by productivity benefits and the absence of charges related to the tivo patent litigation settlement which we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the productivity benefits we experienced in fiscal 2014 were driven by value engineering efforts favorable component pricing and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes 

our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and could be adversely affected by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins such as cisco unified computing system products our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue and as was the case in fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 may be adversely affected by product pricing attributable to competitive factors additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain which in turn could negatively affect gross margin if any of the preceding factors that in the past have negatively impacted our gross margins arise in future periods our gross margins could continue to decline 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013  



product gross margin decreased by 10  percentage points compared with fiscal 2012 unfavorable impacts from product pricing contributed to our decreased product gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013 these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments additionally our product gross margin for fiscal 2013 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold primarily as a result of revenue increases for our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products these impacts were offset by continued productivity improvements the productivity improvements were in large part due to increased benefits from cost savings particularly in certain of our switching and ngn routing categories in which product transitions have been taking place and were driven by value engineering efforts favorable component pricing and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations because the preceding factors largely offset each other the decline in our product gross margin percentage was largely driven by our acquisition of nds which resulted in higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets along with costs resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired as part of that acquisition in addition during fiscal 2013 we incurred charges related to the tivo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter that were included as part of cost of sales the combined effect of these items was a negative impact to our product gross margin of 11 percentage points for fiscal 2013 

service gross margin 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 03  percentage points for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume in both advanced services and technical support services the benefits to gross margin of increased sales volume were partially offset by increased cost impacts such as outside service costs partner delivery costs and headcountrelated costs 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 01  percentage points for fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 although we experienced higher sales volume from growth in both advanced services and in technical support services the resulting benefit to gross margin was offset by increased cost impacts such as headcountrelated costs partner delivery costs and unfavorable mix the mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services business contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



1   the unallocated corporate items for the years presented include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense significant litigation and other contingencies impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory charges related to asset impairments and restructurings and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage increase due to the impact of productivity improvements in this geographic segment partially offsetting this favorable impact to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing and an unfavorable mix the unfavorable mix impact was driven by revenue increases in our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products and lower sales of our higher margin core products partially offset by decreased revenue from our relatively lower margin service provider video products   

the gross margin percentage decrease in our emea segment was due primarily to the unfavorable impacts from pricing as well as an unfavorable mix impact partially offset by productivity improvements in this geographic segment the unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products 

our apjc segment gross margin percentage decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable impacts from pricing and also as a result of an unfavorable mix the unfavorable mix impact was driven by an increase in revenue from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products partially offsetting these factors were impacts from productivity improvements and higher service gross margin in this geographic segment 

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

we experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our americas and apjc segments while our emea segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase 

the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline due to the unfavorable impacts from pricing and also due to unfavorable mix impacts partially offset by productivity improvements 

the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was primarily the result of productivity improvements from lower overall manufacturing costs and to a lesser degree favorable mix impacts and higher service gross margin partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from pricing 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage declined due primarily to the unfavorable impacts from pricing lower service gross margin and unfavorable mix impacts partially offsetting these factors were productivity improvements driven in large part by lower overall manufacturing costs and higher volume 

factors that may impact revenue and gross margin 

product revenue may continue to be affected by factors including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty that have resulted in reduced itrelated capital spending in certain segments within our enterprise service provider public sector and commercial markets changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions competition including pricefocused competitors from asia especially from china new product introductions sales cycles and product implementation cycles changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales variations in sales channels and final acceptance criteria of the product system or solution as specified by the customer sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our collaboration data center and service provider video product categories in addition service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including network design services and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition as we focus on new market opportunities customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support especially in certain emerging countries which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter revenue and operating results 

product revenue may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and internet businesses whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products adoption of new networking standards and financial difficulties experienced by our customers we may from time to time experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components resulting in delayed shipments to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter for additional factors that may impact product revenue see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs increased sales to our distributors generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a certain degree the timing of orders from our customers we recognize revenue for sales to our distributors generally based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 

product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products introduction of new products including products with priceperformance advantages and new business models for our offerings such as xaas our ability to reduce production costs entry into new markets including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures as a result of internal development or through acquisitions changes in distribution channels price competition including competitors from asia especially those from china changes in geographic mix of our product revenue the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals sales discounts increases in material or labor costs including sharebased compensation expense excess inventory and obsolescence charges warranty costs changes in shipment volume loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing effects of value engineering inventory holding charges and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals sharebased compensation expense and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business 

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



rd expenses 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

rd expenses increased for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  primarily due to compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme networks inc “insieme” see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements higher sharebased compensation expense and higher contracted services also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our financial performance and efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in august 2013 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

the increase in rd expenses for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  was primarily due to higher headcountrelated expenses attributable in large part to our acquisitions partially offsetting these costs was lower sharebased compensation expense 

sales and marketing expenses 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  decreased slightly due to lower advertising expenses reductions in other discretionary spending and lower expenses in other areas such as depreciation expense these decreases were substantially offset by higher share based compensation expense and higher acquisition related costs 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  sales and marketing expenses decreased by 109 million  primarily due to lower sharebased compensation expense and to a lesser degree lower discretionary spending and contracted services these items were partially offset by higher headcountrelated expense resulting largely from our acquisitions 

ga expenses 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

ga expenses decreased in fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  due to lower contracted services lower corporatelevel expenses and lower headcountrelated expenses the lower headcountrelated expenses were due to efficiencies related to our workforce reduction plan announced in august 2013 and also due to reduced variable compensation expense as a result of our lower financial performance 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

ga expenses decreased in fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2013 of 202 million of impairment charges on real estate held for sale recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 lower sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2013 and a recovery in the market value of property held for sale recorded during fiscal 2013 also contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher headcountrelated expenses resulting in part from our acquisitions and also by higher corporatelevel expenses corporatelevel expenses which tend to vary from period to period included operational infrastructure activities such as it project implementations which included investments in our global data center infrastructure and investments related to operational and financial systems 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2014  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 153 million  or approximately 09  compared with fiscal 2013  in fiscal 2013  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 227 million  or approximately 13  compared with fiscal 2012  

headcount 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

our headcount decreased by approximately 1000 employees in fiscal 2014   the decrease was due to headcount reductions from attrition and from our workforce reduction plan announced in august 2013 these headcount reductions were partially offset by the increase in headcount from targeted hiring in engineering services sales and also by increased headcount from our recent acquisitions 

in august 2014 we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6000  employees representing approximately 8  of our global workforce we expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key growth areas such as data center software security and cloud 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

our headcount increased by 8410 employees in fiscal 2013  the increase was attributable to the headcount from acquisitions the largest of which was nds as well as targeted hiring in engineering and services 

sharebased compensation expense 

the following table presents sharebased compensation expense in millions 



the increase in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  was due primarily to sharebased compensation expense attributable to equity awards assumed with respect to our recent acquisitions and higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013 

the decrease in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of sharebased awards granted in recent periods higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013 and the effect of stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets in millions 



amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in both fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  as compared with the respective prior fiscal years the increases were primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our recent acquisitions partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

restructuring and other charges 

fiscal 2014 plan and fiscal 2011 plans   

in august 2013 we announced a workforce reduction plan that would impact up to 4000  employees or 5  of our global workforce in connection with this fiscal 2014 plan during fiscal 2014  we incurred within operating expenses restructuring and other charges of approximately 418 million  which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction plan under the fiscal 2014 plan we have completed the fiscal 2014 plan and we do not expect any remaining charges related to this action  in fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  we incurred within operating expenses net restructuring and other charges of 105 million  and 304 million  respectively which were related primarily to employee severance charges for employees impacted by our workforce reduction under fiscal 2011 plans 

fiscal 2015 plan 

in august 2014 we announced a restructuring plan that will impact up to 6000  employees representing approximately 8  of our global workforce we expect to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we currently estimate that we will recognize pretax charges in an amount not expected to exceed 700 million  consisting of severance and other onetime termination benefits and other associated costs 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

for fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  operating income decreased by 17  and as a percentage of revenue operating income decreased by 32  percentage points the decrease resulted from the following a decrease in revenue a gross margin percentage decline driven in part by the 655 million supplier component remediation charge or 14 percentage points the 416 million  compensation expense recorded in fiscal 2014 in connection with our acquisition of the remaining interest in insieme and an increase in restructuring and other charges related to the workforce reduction under the fiscal 2014 plan 

in fiscal 2013 our results reflected solid execution on delivering profitable growth as we grew operating income faster than revenue in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 operating income increased by 11 and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 11 percentage points the increases resulted from the following revenue growth of 6 continuing focus on expense management which resulted in lower sales and marketing and ga expenses as a percentage of revenue and lower restructuring and other charges 

interest and other income loss net 

interest income expense net   the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

interest income increased in fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013 due to the increase in our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments   the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2014  as compared with the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the favorable impact of incremental interest rate swaps entered into during fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 this decrease was partially offset by additional interest expense due to the increase in longterm debt in fiscal 2014 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2013 as compared with prior fiscal year due primarily to increased interest income earned on financing receivables partially offset by lower interest income from our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments as a result of lower average interest rates the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps and lower expense on our floatingrate notes as the benchmark london interbank offered rate libor decreased 

other income loss net     the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 



fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the increase in total net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2014  compared with fiscal 2013  was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities in the current period as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities 

the change in net losses on investments in privately held companies for the fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013  was primarily due to an increase of 40 million in our proportional share of losses from our vce joint venture partially offset by higher realized gains from various investments in privately held companies 

the change in other gains losses net in fiscal 2014  as compared with fiscal 2013 was primarily due to higher gains on equity derivative instruments and lower donation expenses partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2014  

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

the decrease in net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2013 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities for fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 the change in net losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher realized gains from various private investments partially offset by an increase of 23 million in our proportional share of losses from our vce joint venture the change in other gains losses net for fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily due to an increase in donations and less favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2013 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 192  for fiscal 2014  compared with 111  for fiscal 2013  the net 81  percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a nonrecurring net tax benefit of 794 million or 71 percentage points due to a tax settlement with the irs in fiscal 2013 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 111  for fiscal 2013 compared with 208  for fiscal 2012 the net 97  percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a net tax benefit of 794 million or 71 percentage points due to a tax settlement with the irs and an increase in tax benefits of 144 million or 12 percentage points due to the retroactive reinstatement of the us federal rd tax credit in fiscal 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments   the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the net increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of 123 billion  a net increase in debt of 47 billion  and the issuance of common stock of 19 billion  pursuant to employee stock incentive and purchase plans these sources of cash were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock of 94 billion  under the stock repurchase program cash dividends paid of 38 billion  net cash paid for acquisitions of 30 billion  and capital expenditures of 13 billion  

our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was 474 billion  and 404 billion  as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  respectively under current tax laws and regulations if these assets were to be distributed from the foreign subsidiaries to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes the balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the united states as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  was 47 billion  and 102 billion  respectively 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

free cash flow and capital allocation     as part of our capital allocation strategy we intend to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue excess tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other 

required uses of cash including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



on august 26 2014  our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 019  per common share to be paid on october 22 2014  to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on october 2 2014  any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our board of directors 

accounts receivable net the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions and dso 



our accounts receivable net as of july 26 2014  decreased by approximately 6  compared with the end of fiscal 2013  our dso as of july 26 2014  was lower by 2  days compared with the end of fiscal 2013  primarily due to an improvement in the linearity of shipments 

inventory supply chain   the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions except annualized inventory turns 



inventory as of july 26 2014  increased by 8  from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2013  and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased   by approximately 3  on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 5  compared with the end of fiscal 2013  we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts 

our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers manufactured finished goods consist primarily of buildtoorder and buildtostock products 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees  we measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue as of july 26 2014  our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows in millions 



financing receivables   financing receivables less unearned income increased by 2  compared with the end of fiscal 2013  the change was primarily due to a 2  increase in both loan receivables and financed service contracts and other and also due to 1  increase in lease receivables we provide financing to certain enduser customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products services and networking solutions these financing arrangements include leases financed service contracts and loans arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets lease receivables include salestype and directfinancing leases we also provide certain qualified customers financing for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 

financing guarantees   in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed 

deferred revenue related to financing receivables and guarantees   the majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts the majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts which primarily relates to technical support services is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed a portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met 

borrowings 

senior notes   the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 



1 in march 2014 we issued senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of 80 billion  

we repaid senior floatingrate and fixedrate notes upon their maturity in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 for an aggregate principal amount of 33 billion  

interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium interest is payable quarterly on the floatingrate notes we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 26 2014  

other debt   other debt as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements as of july 27 2013  we also had outstanding notes related to our investment in insieme the amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was 12 million   and 31 million as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  respectively 

commercial paper   in fiscal 2011 we established a shortterm debt financing program of up to 30 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes we use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes in fiscal 2014 we issued and repaid 10 billion  of indebtedness under commercial paper and had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of each of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  

credit facility   on february 17 2012 we entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on february 17 2017 any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus 050 bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or onemonth libor plus 100 or ii libor plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement as of july 26 2014  we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

we may also upon the agreement of either the existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion andor extend the expiration date of the credit facility by up to two additional years or up to february 17 2019 

deferred revenue   the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



the increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2014  reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals partially offset by an increase in customers paying technical support service contracts over time and the impact of ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue the increase in deferred product revenue was primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements and to a lesser extent due to an increase in shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria as of july 26 2014  

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 26 2014  in millions 



operating leases   for more information on our operating leases see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers   we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” as of july 26 2014  the liability for these purchase commitments was 162 million  and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 

other purchase obligations   other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt   the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities   other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 1851 million   and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 369 million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

insieme networks inc    in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we made an investment in insieme an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market as set forth in the agreement between cisco and insieme this investment included 100 million  of funding and a license to certain of our technology immediately prior to the call option exercise and acquisition described below we owned approximately 83  of insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of insieme in our consolidated financial statements in connection with this investment we entered into a putcall option agreement that provided us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in insieme in addition the noncontrolling interest holders could require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we exercised our call option and entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in insieme the acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 at which time the former noncontrolling interest holders became eligible to receive up to two milestone payments which will be determined using agreedupon formulas based primarily on revenue for certain of insieme’s products during fiscal 2014  we recorded compensation expense of 416 million  related to the fair value of the vested portion of amounts that are expected to be earned by the former noncontrolling interest holders continued vesting and changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense in future periods based on the terms of the agreement we have determined that the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately 855 million  net of forfeitures and including the 416 million  that has been expensed during fiscal 2014  the milestone payments if earned are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 

other funding commitments   we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 255 million  as of july 26 2014  compared with 263 million  as of july 27 2013  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers these privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 26 2014  there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

vce is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with emc corporation “emc” with investments from vmware inc “vmware” and intel corporation vce helps organizations leverage bestinclass technologies and disciplines from cisco emc and vmware to enable the transformation to cloud computing as of july 26 2014  our cumulative gross investment in vce was approximately 716 million  inclusive of accrued interest and our ownership percentage was approximately 35  during fiscal 2014  we invested approximately 185 million  in vce we account for our investment in vce under the equity method and our portion of vce’s net loss is recognized in other income loss net as of july 26 2014  we have recorded cumulative losses from vce of 644 million  since inception our carrying value in vce as of july 26 2014  was 72 million  over the next 12 months as vce scales its operations we may make additional investments in vce and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership 

from time to time emc and cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of vce to indemnify third parties such as customers for monetary damages such guarantees were not material as of july 26 2014  

on an ongoing basis we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

securities lending 

we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis the average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2014  and 2013 was 15 billion   and 07 billion  respectively we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  we had no outstanding securities lending transactions we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities   we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july 26 2014  our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july 26 2014  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers as of july 26 2014  approximately 76  of our fixed income securities balance consisted of us government and us government agency securities we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2014  and fiscal 2013  we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 bps or minus 150 bps was relevant the hypothetical fair values as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  are as follows in millions 

  





financing receivables   as of july 26 2014  our financing receivables had a carrying value of 81 billion  compared with 79 billion  as of july 27 2013  as of july 26 2014  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt     as of july 26 2014  we had 208 billion  in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which consisted of 24 billion  floatingrate notes and 184 billion  fixedrate notes the carrying amount of the senior notes was 209 billion  and the related fair value based on market prices was 224 billion  as of july 26 2014  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 104 billion  of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of approximately 04 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt that is not hedged 

equity price risk 

the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard  poor’s 500 index or nasdaq composite index these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

publicly traded equity securities   the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio excluding hedged equity securities if any potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 20 and 30 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of july 26 2014  and july 27 2013  are as follows in millions 





investments in privately held companies   we have also invested in privately held companies these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method as of july 26 2014  the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 899 million  compared with 833 million  at july 27 2013  some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 



we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 65 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2014  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 153 million  or approximately 09  compared with fiscal 2013 in fiscal 2013  foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 227 million  or approximately 13  as compared with fiscal 2012  to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities 



we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes

we conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography our business is organized into the following three geographic segments the americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific japan and china apjc for revenue and other information regarding these segments see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

we were incorporated in california in december 1984 and our headquarters are in san jose california the mailing address of our headquarters is 170 west tasman drive san jose california 951341706 and our telephone number at that location is 408 5264000 our website is wwwciscocom through a link on the investor relations section of our website we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission sec our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act all such filings are available free of charge the information posted on our website is not incorporated into this report 

as part of our business focus on the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it our products and services are designed to help our customers use technology to address their business imperatives and opportunitiesimproving productivity and user experience reducing costs and gaining a competitive advantageand to help them connect more effectively with their key stakeholders including their customers prospects business partners suppliers and employees we deliver networking products and solutions designed to simplify and secure customers’ network infrastructures we also deliver products and solutions that leverage the network to most effectively address market transitions and customer requirementsincluding in recent periods virtualization cloud collaboration and video we believe that integrating multiple network services into and across our products helps our customers reduce their operational complexity increase their agility and reduce their total cost of network ownership our products and technologies are grouped into the following categories switching nextgeneration network ngn routing service provider video collaboration wireless data center security and other products 

network architectures built on core routing and switching technologies are evolving to accommodate the demands of increasing numbers of users network applications and new networkrelated markets these new markets are a natural extension of our core business and have emerged as the network has become the platform for provisioning integrating and delivering an everincreasing array of itbased products and services 

strategy and focus areas 

our focus continues to be on our five foundational priorities  

 we believe that focusing on these priorities best positions us to continue to expand our share of our customers’ information technology spending   

we continue to undergo product transitions in our core business including the introduction of nextgeneration products with higher price performance and architectural advantages compared with both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors we believe that many of these product transitions are gaining momentum based on the strong yearoveryear product revenue growth across these nextgeneration product families we believe that our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute may enable us to improve our relative competitive position in many of our product areas even in uncertain or difficult business conditions and therefore may continue to provide us with longterm growth opportunities however we believe that these newly introduced products may continue to negatively impact product gross margins which we are currently striving to address through various initiatives including value engineering effective supply chain management and delivering greater customer value through offers that include hardware software and services 

we continue to seek to capitalize on market transitions which we believe are gaining in frequency market transitions relating to the network are becoming in our view more significant as intelligent networks have moved from being a mere cost center issue—where the focus is on reducing network operating costs and increasing networkrelated productivity—to becoming a platform for improved revenue generation as well as driving business agility and strategy execution 

market transitions for which we are primarily focused include those related to the increased role of virtualizationthe cloud video collaboration networked mobility technologies and the transition from internet protocol ip version 4 to version 6 for example a significant transition is under way in the enterprise data center market where the move to virtualizationthe cloud is rapidly evolving there is a continued growing awareness that intelligent networks are becoming the platform for productivity improvement and global competitiveness we believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market is accelerating due to changing technology trends such as the increasing adoption of virtualization the rise in scalable processing and the advent of cloud computing and cloudbased it resource deployments and business models these key terms are defined as follows 

 this virtualization and clouddriven market transition in the enterprise data center market is being brought about through the convergence of networking computing storage and software technologies we are seeking to take advantage of this market transition through among other things our cisco unified computing system platform and cisco nexus product families which are designed to integrate the previously segregated technologies in the enterprise data center with a unified architecture we are also seeking to capitalize on this market transition through the development of other cloudbased product and service offerings through which we intend to enable customers to develop and deploy their own cloudbased it solutions including softwareasaservice saas and otherasaservice xaas solutions 

the competitive landscape in the enterprise data center market is changing very large wellfinanced and aggressive competitors are each bringing their own new class of products to address this new market we expect this competitive market trend to continue with respect to this market we believe the network will be the intersection of innovation through an open ecosystem and open standards we expect to see acquisitions further industry consolidation and new alliances among companies as they seek to serve the enterprise data center market as we enter this next market phase we expect that we will strengthen certain strategic alliances 

compete more with certain strategic alliances and partners and perhaps also encounter new competitors and partners in our attempt to deliver the best solutions for our customers 

we are focusing on a market transition involving the move toward more programmable flexible and virtual networks sometimes called software defined networking or sdn this transition is focused on moving from a hardwarecentric approach for networking to a virtualized network environment that is designed to enable flexible applicationdriven customization of network infrastructures we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine applicationspecific integrated circuits asics with hardware and software elements together to meet customers’ total cost of ownership quality security scalability and experience requirements in our view there is no single architecture that supports all customer requirements in this area pursuant to our strategy which is targeted to address a broad range of specific customer use cases we will look to next steps that will follow the initial implementations that are under way 

we plan to address the sdn opportunity — to enable more open and programmable network infrastructure — with a broad strategy and set of solutions we introduced the cisco open network environment or cisco one including overlay network technology application programming interfaces apis and networkoperation tools called agents and controllers and we have over 120 customers in a trial phase for these solutions 

we have also begun introducing our applicationcentric infrastructure aci strategy with the goal of going a step further to transform network data centers to better address the demands of users who will be seeking access to new and current applications on their networks specifically aci is a data center networking architecture designed to provide customer it networks with the ability to deliver business and other applications to end users with a simpler operational model within a secure and potentially expandable infrastructure and in a costeffective manner 

in our view this evolution — driven by mobile device proliferation and cloud delivered data — is in early stages but we believe we have a differentiated strategy with a unique ability to deploy data centers in locations ranging from the campus to the cloud we intend to continue to drive internal innovation partner for codevelopment and make strategic investments to deliver the highest value solutions to our customers 

we believe that the architectural approach that we have undertaken in the enterprise data center market is adaptable to other markets an example of a market where we aim to apply this approach is mobility where growth of ip traffic on handheld devices is driving the need for more robust architectures equipment and services in order to accommodate not only an increasing number of worldwide mobile device users but also increased user demand for broadbandquality business network and consumer web applications to be delivered on such devices a key term in this mobilitycentered market transition is “byod” an acronym for “bring your own device” which in the context of it usage in companies universities and other organizations refers to the growing trend of employees customers students and others associated with such entities bringing and using their own laptop computers smartphones tablets or other mobile devices for their work or participation instead of using equipment provided by the organization         

with regard to this market transition to help such organizations meet the demands of increasing byod usage our product development strategy involves a comprehensive architectural approach that will allow for among other things a unified security policy across the whole organization a simplified operations and network management structure that understands application performance from a user’s perspective enhances troubleshooting capability and lowers network operating costs and an uncompromised user experience over the organization’s entire wireless and wired network that embraces use of any kind of device our mobilityrelated products and solutions reflect this architecturalbased approach 

other market transitions on which we are focusing particular attention include those related to the convergence of video collaboration and networked mobility technologies which we believe will drive productivity and growth in network loads and which convergence appears to be evolving even more quickly and more significantly than we had previously anticipated cisco telepresence systems are one example of product offerings that have incorporated video collaboration and networked mobility technologies as customers evolve their communications and business models more generally we are focused on simplifying and expanding the creation distribution and use of endtoend video solutions for businesses and consumers 

we believe that several current market transitions are combining into a potentially significant transition in the ip network industry which we refer to as the internet of everything ioe ioe refers to the networked connection of people process data and things such as appliances devices and everyday objects and is a market transition that we believe will create by bringing “everything” online significant opportunities for organizations communities and countries to obtain greater value from networked connections in parallel with the anticipated proliferation in number of networkconnected things significant advances have been made in internet and networkrelated technologies such as the evolution of the cloud the advent of ipv6 the proliferation of mobile networking and the increase in global broadband availability these advances in turn are leading to continuing increases in network capabilities which in combination with the growth in number of ip connections are reasons why ioe has the potential to be a significant market transition that we believe may offer significant economic and societal benefits 

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

products and services 

our current offerings fall into several categories 

switching 

switching is an integral networking technology used in campuses branch offices and data centers switches are used within buildings in localarea networks lans and across great distances in widearea networks wans our switching products offer many forms of connectivity to end users workstations ip phones access points and servers and also function as aggregators on lans and wans our switching systems employ several widely used technologies including ethernet power over ethernet fibre channel over ethernet fcoe packet over synchronous optical network and multiprotocol label switching many of our switches are designed to support an integrated set of advanced services allowing organizations to be more efficient by using one switch for multiple networking functions rather than multiple switches to accomplish the same functions key product platforms within our switching product category in which we also include storage products are as follows 



fixedconfiguration switches   are designed to cover a range of deployments in small and mediumsized businesses our fixedconfiguration switches are designed to provide a foundation for converged data voice and video services they range from small standalone switches to stackable models that function as a single scalable switching unit 

modular switches are typically utilized by enterprise and service provider customers these products are designed to offer flexibility and scalability for these customers which due to their largescale network demands often need to deploy numerous advancedfunctionality networking services without degrading overall performance 

fixedconfiguration and modular switches also include products such as optics modules which are shared across multiple product platforms 

our switching portfolio also includes virtual switches and service offerings these products provide switching functionality for virtual machines and are designed to operate in a complementary fashion with virtual services to optimize security and application behavior

other products 

our other products category primarily consists of certain emerging technologies and other networking products 

service 

in addition to our product offerings we provide a broad range of service offerings including technical support services and advanced services 

technical support services help ensure that our products operate efficiently remain available and benefit from the most uptodate system software that we have developed these services help customers protect their network investments and minimize downtime for systems running missioncritical applications a key example of this is our cisco smart services offering which leverages the intelligence from cisco’s millions of devices and customer connections to protect and optimize network investment for our customers and partners 

advanced services are services that are part of a comprehensive program that is designed to provide responsive preventive and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs the advanced services program supports networking devices applications solutions and complete infrastructures our service and support strategy seeks to capitalize on increased globalization and we believe this strategy along with our architectural approach has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors 

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 or more of our revenue our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise service provider commercial and public sector 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we strive to take advantage of the networkasaplatform strategy to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide they include regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also group media broadcast and content providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased services and contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our routing and switching optical security video mobility and network management products systems and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the scale and complexity of their networks which requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

commercial 

generally we define commercial businesses as companies with fewer than 1000 employees the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market are served by a combination of our direct salesforce and our channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or companies with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain these smaller companies within the commercial market are primarily served by our channel partners 

public sector 

public sector entities include federal governments state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector entities have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector entities through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers   

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2013  our worldwide sales and marketing departments consisted of 24938  employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in 94 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors hold inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 



for additional information regarding these financing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

product backlog 

our product backlog at july 27 2013  the last day of our 2013 fiscal year was approximately 49 billion  compared with product backlog of approximately 50 billion  at july 28 2012  the last day of our 2012 fiscal year the product backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our product backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual product revenue for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities our growth strategy is based on the three components of innovation which we sometimes refer to as our “build buy and partner” approach the foregoing is a way of describing how we strive to innovate we can internally develop or build our own innovative solutions we can acquire or buy companies with innovative technologies and we can partner with companies to jointly develop andor resell product technologies and innovations the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all of the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services we work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions investments and alliances to summarize we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking and communications products and services 

 acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk 

factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or new market creation companies that we have or recently had strategic alliances with include the following 

accenture ltd att inc cap gemini sa citrix systems inc emc corporation fujitsu limited intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa johnson controls inc microsoft corporation netapp inc nokia siemens networks oracle corporation red hat inc sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy services ltd vce company llc “vce” vmware inc wipro limited and others 

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include alcatellucent amazon web services llc arista networks inc arris group inc aruba networks inc avaya inc brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd citrix systems inc dell inc lm ericsson telephone company extreme networks inc f5 networks inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc microsoft corporation motorola solutions inc palo alto networks inc polycom inc riverbed technology inc symantec corporation and vmware inc among others 

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success   

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of switching ngn routing service provider video collaboration wireless data center security and other product technologies for this purpose our research and development expenditures were  59 billion  55 billion  and 58 billion  in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of focus are tied to our foundational priorities and include but are not limited to our core routing and switching products collaboration and the cisco unified computing system and other products related to the data center our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge such as ip version 6 nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time defined as less than one year 

patents intellectual property and licensing 

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses” 

employees 

employees are summarized as follows 



1   cost of sales includes manufacturing support services and training 

we consider the relationships with our employees to be positive competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include   





































as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 













the global macroeconomic environment and recovery from the downturn has been challenging and inconsistent instability in the global credit markets the impact of uncertainty regarding the us federal budget including the effect of the recent sequestration tapering of bond purchases by the us federal reserve the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example during fiscal 2011 we experienced a decrease in spending by our public sector customers in almost every developed market around the world and we continue to see decreases in spending within certain categories of our public sector customer market 

we have been investing in priorities including our foundational priorities and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we have been realigning and are dedicating resources to focus on certain priorities such as leadership in our core routing switching and services including security and mobility solutions collaboration data center virtualization and cloud video and architectures for business transformation however the return on our investments in such priorities may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty 

our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline which for example occurred in fiscal 2009 our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of 

capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter revenue and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2011 and to a lesser extent in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 and may continue to decline and be adversely affected by numerous factors including   



































changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as data center collaboration and service provider video in addition to longer sales cycles in the past we have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers over certain extended periods of time as market conditions have fluctuated sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers and distributors systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers we refer to sales through distributors as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is generally recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 









in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition further sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to the company’s distribution channels 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in our priorities as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 busines s of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 



















we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 





a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or reramping manufacturing capacity for highly complex products during periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future   







manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe the industry is evolving to enable personal and business process collaboration enabled by networked technologies as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multipleparty collaborative interaction would demand and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it for example in fiscal 2009 we launched our cisco unified computing system our nextgeneration enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing network storage access and virtualization resources in a single system which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center cisco unified computing system is one of several priorities on which we are focusing resources another example of a market transition we are focusing on is the move towards more programmable flexible and virtual 

networks in our view this evolution is in its very early stages and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine asics hardware and software elements together 

the process of developing new technology including technology related to more programmable flexible and virtual networks is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking to collaborative systems does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours our business could be harmed furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our newer product categories such as data center and collaboration as well as those in our other products category that we identify as “emerging technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses asset impairments and workforce reductions 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

in august 2013 we announced that we are rebalancing our resources with a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4000 employees or 5 of our global workforce we expect to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and we expect to incur significant charges as a result of these activities the implementation of this workforce reduction plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the workforce reduction plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing functions as we focus on our foundational priorities such as leadership in our core routing switching and services including security and mobility solutions collaboration data center virtualization and cloud video and architectures for business transformation we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 















acquisitions may also cause us to   



















mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunitiesfor example storage wireless security transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network and other areas within our newer products categories such as data center and collaboration emerging technologies and our prioritieswe will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners although sales in several of our emerging countries decreased in recent periods several of our emerging countries generally have been relatively fast growing and we have announced plans to expand our commitments and expectations in certain of those countries as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the united states including impacts from the us federal budget including the effect of the recent sequestration tapering of bond purchases by the us federal reserve and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following   















we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries 

we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors these distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments during fiscal 2009 we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim 

were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products 

as is the case with leading products around the world our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products while we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors resulting in fines imprisonment and restitution to us there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed while counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sales to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales could adversely affect our operating results 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales or other taxes on internet product or service sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect to an alleged underpayment of income taxes social taxes interest and penalties by a brazilian distributor the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2008 and the related asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to approximately 385 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes approximately 11 billion  for interest and approximately 17 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 27 2013  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of  160 billion  that mature at specific dates in 2014 2016 2017 2019 2020 2039 and 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 30 billion  we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 27 2013   the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually except 125 billion  of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program

brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in addition to claims asserted by the brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years tax authorities from the brazilian state of sao paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect to an alleged underpayment of income taxes social taxes interest and penalties by a brazilian distributor 

the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2008 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to approximately 385 million  for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes approximately 11 billion  for interest and approximately 17 billion  for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 27 2013  we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years

a summary of our results is as follows in millions except percentages and pershare amounts 



fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012—financial performance 

revenue increased 6  with product revenue increasing 5  and service revenue increasing 9  total gross margin decreased by 06  percentage points various items such as higher amortization of purchased intangible assets and the tivo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 contributed to the product gross margin percentage decline as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 14  percentage points primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenses and lower general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were lower due primarily to the absence in the current fiscal year of impairment charges on real estate held for sale operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 11  percentage points primarily as a result of an increase in revenue lower restructuring charges and our continuing focus on expense management diluted earnings per share increased by 25  from the prior year a result of both a 24  increase in net income and also to a lesser degree from a slight decline of 24 million  shares in our diluted share count a significant driver of the increase in net income in fiscal 2013 was our realization of additional tax benefits of 10 billion primarily related to a tax settlement with the irs and the reinstatement of the us federal rd tax credit 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012—business summary 

our solid fiscal 2013  performance reflects our continued execution on our financial strategy to deliver profitable growth to maximize shareholder value for the long term in what continues to be a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment we grew profits faster than revenue with revenue increasing by 6  while net income increased by 24  

in fiscal 2013  revenue increased by 25 billion  the americas contributed 21 billion  of the increase led by higher sales in the united states apjc contributed 03 billion  to the revenue increase led by strong sales growth in india emea added 01 billion  to the revenue increase in fiscal 2013 both our product and service categories experienced revenue growth across each of our geographic segments we encountered certain challenges from a geographic perspective including those related to macroeconomic challenges in much of europe we also faced some macroeconomic challenges in apjc particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 which most notably involved china and japan partially offsetting these challenges was solid revenue growth in fiscal 2013  in certain emerging countries such as mexico within the americas india within apjc and russia within emea 

from a customer markets standpoint in fiscal 2013  we had solid revenue growth in the commercial market as well as growth in the service provider market due in large part to the acquisition of nds the enterprise and public sector customer markets experienced slight declines in revenue in fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012 global public sector spending was a challenge for us in fiscal 2013  particularly in the americas attributable in part to lower us public sector spending during parts of fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2013  product revenue increased by 17 billion  while service revenue increased by 08 billion  the product revenue increase was driven by the following an increase of 10 billion  from service provider video products driven primarily by the acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013  an increase of 08 billion  from data center products due to continued strong customer demand and an increase of 05 billion  from wireless products due to continued demand for these solutions these product revenue increases along with the service revenue contribution reflect in our view the success we are experiencing with our technology architectures and our ability to deliver customer solutions particularly in both the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments overall our product revenue from our core product areas was flat as an increase in revenue from our switching products was offset by a decrease in revenue from our ngn routing products 

we achieved solid and profitable growth in fiscal 2013  and did so in a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment this included in particular weakness in the european economy lower global public sector spending and a conservative approach to itrelated capital spending by customers notwithstanding improvements we saw in some of these areas during the latter part of fiscal 2013 our business in fiscal 2014 may continue to be impacted by these challenges as well as other macroeconomic challenges including weakness in certain emerging countries such as china 

in order to invest more significantly in our growth opportunity areas of our portfolio including cloud data center mobility services software and security we will rebalance our resources in fiscal 2014 as a result we have announced a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4000 employees or 5 of our global workforce we expect that these actions will position cisco to invest in these growth opportunities as our business continues to evolve and to drive operational efficiencies 

fourth quarter snapshot 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013  as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2012  revenue increased by 6  with both product and service revenue increasing by 6  with regard to our geographic segment performance on a yearoveryear basis revenue increased by 7  in the americas increased by 12  in emea and decreased by 3  in apjc total gross margin decreased by 14  percentage points primarily as a result of the tivo patent litigation settlement as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 29  percentage points primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 general and administrative expenses included 202 million of real estate charges primarily related to impairment charges on real estate held for sale operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 24  percentage points primarily as a result of lower general and administrative expenses lower restructuring and other charges and also the impact of our revenue increase diluted earnings per share increased by 17  from the prior year period primarily as a result of an 18  increase in net income 

strategy and focus areas 

our focus continues to be on our five foundational priorities  

 we believe that focusing on these priorities best positions us to continue to expand our share of our customers’ information technology spending   for a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas see item 1 business 

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 in millions except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso and annualized inventory turns 



our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2013  was 49 billion  or 10  of fiscal 2013  total revenue compared with 50 billion  at the end of fiscal 2012  or 11  of fiscal 2012  total revenue 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met when a sale involves multiple deliverables such as sales of products that include services the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met 

the amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and if so our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables according to the accounting guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  we use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those units when available we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately 80 of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15 of the median rates when vsoe does not exist we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multipledeliverable arrangements under the selling price hierarchy thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of others in our markets and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers in determining esp we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering companyspecific factors such as geographies competitive landscape internal costs profitability objectives pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 

some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition  

as our business and offerings evolve over time our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly which could result in changes in selling prices including both vsoe and esp in subsequent periods there were no material impacts during fiscal 2013  nor do we currently expect a material impact in the next 12 months on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe tpe or esp 

revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements service support and other factors financing arrangements may include salestype directfinancing and operating leases loans and guarantees of thirdparty financing our deferred revenue for products was 40 billion  and 37 billion  as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  respectively technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed which typically is from one to three years advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance our deferred revenue for services was 94 billion  and 92 billion  as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  respectively 

we make sales to distributors which we refer to as twotier systems of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs if actual credits received by our distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

allowances for receivables and sales returns 

the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions except percentages 



the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates which are published by major thirdparty creditrating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts if a major customers creditworthiness deteriorates if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis we consider historical experience credit quality and age of receivable balances and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay when evaluating financing receivables on a collective basis we use expected default frequency rates published by a major thirdparty creditrating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation determining expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings as well as assessing factors such as economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation are complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our operating results 

both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 

a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates the reserve for future sales returns as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  was 119 million  and 129 million  respectively and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

our inventory balance was 15 billion  and 17 billion  as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  respectively inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory as of july 27 2013  the liability for these purchase commitments was 172 million  compared with 193 million  as of july 28 2012  and was included in other current liabilities 

our provision for inventory was 114 million  115 million  and 196 million  for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011  respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 106 million  151 million  and 114 million  in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011  respectively the decrease in our provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for fiscal 2013  was primarily due to the increase in demand for our products resulting in lower inventory levels with our contract manufacturers during fiscal 2013 if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties included in other current liabilities was 431 million  as of july 27 2013  compared with 415 million  as of july 28 2012  see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 

the provision for product warranties issued during fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011  was 664 million  661 million  and 456 million  respectively if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our profitability could be adversely affected 

sharebased compensation expense 

sharebased compensation expense is presented as follows in millions 



restricted stock units are valued using the market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for the present value of expected dividends restricted stock unit awards with marketbased conditions are valued using a monte carlo simulation see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables for employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the riskfree interest rate and expected dividends as of the grant date for employee stock options we historically have used the implied volatility for twoyear traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the latticebinomial model for employee stock purchase rights we used the implied volatility for traded options with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights on our stock the selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility the valuation of employee stock options granted in prior fiscal years but for which expense was recognized during the fiscal years presented is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 

because sharebased compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for forfeitures if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our optionpricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year 

fair value measurements 

our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities collectively are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of 427 billion  as of july 27 2013  compared with 389 billion  as of july 28 2012  our fixed income investment portfolio as of july 27 2013  consisted primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

as described more fully in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments it encompasses three classes of investments level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and modelderived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 

our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data we use inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities we use such pricing data as the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2013 and 2012  to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 

the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 27 2013  we had no level 3 investments in our total portfolio as of july 27 2013  

otherthantemporary impairments 

we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these securities to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected we consider all available information including past events current conditions the remaining payment terms of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of underlying collateral 

for publicly traded equity securities we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were not material in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011  there were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011  our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

we also have investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages as of july 27 2013  our investments in privately held companies were 833 million  compared with 858 million  as of july 28 2012  and were included in other assets we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 33 million 23 million  and 10 million  in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011  respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  was 219 billion  and 170 billion  respectively the increase in goodwill for fiscal 2013 was due in large part to our acquisitions of nds and meraki in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011  for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2013  the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 387 billion for the americas 155 billion for emea and 178 billion for apjc we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of july 27 2013  would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts there was no impairment charge related to purchased intangible assets during fiscal 2013  our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were 12 million  and 164 million  during fiscal 2012  and 2011  respectively our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations rd tax credits domestic manufacturing deductions tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 111  208  and 171  in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011  respectively 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit or domestic manufacturing deduction laws by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

results of operations 

revenue 

the following table presents the breakdown of revenue between product and service in millions except percentages 



we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our revenue which includes product and service for each segment is summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012   

for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  total revenue increased by 6  within total revenue growth product revenue increased by 5  while service revenue increased by 9  our product and service revenue totals reflect revenue growth across each of our geographic segments the revenue increase was primarily due to the following the solid performance of our service offerings our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 and increased demand for our data center and wireless products 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and budgetdriven reductions in spending by government entities revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multipleelement arrangements the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment as has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time customers require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support and these activities may occur in future periods which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011   

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  total revenue increased by 7  within total revenue growth product revenue increased by 5  while service revenue increased by 12  our product and service revenue totals reflected revenue growth across each of our geographic segments the revenue increase was primarily due to the following the strong performance of our service offerings new product transitions taking place in switching and increased demand for our data center service provider video and wireless products 

product revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of product revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



americas 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  product revenue in the americas segment increased by 7  the increase in product revenue was across most of our customer markets in the americas segment led by solid growth in the service provider and commercial markets and to a lesser degree growth in the enterprise market the growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due in large part to our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 within the americas segment we experienced a product revenue decline in the public sector market driven by lower sales to the public sector in the united states from a country perspective product revenue increased by 9 in the united states 13 in brazil and 7 in mexico during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we experienced some weakness in our business momentum in certain countries within latin america 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  product revenue in the americas segment increased by 5  the increase in product revenue was across most of our customer markets in the americas segment led by growth in the enterprise service provider and commercial markets we experienced a product revenue decline in the public sector market for the fiscal year within the americas segment product revenue to the us public sector was flat as lower product revenue to the us federal government was offset by higher product revenue to state and local government from a country perspective product revenue increased by 4 in the united states 10 in canada 21 in mexico and 14 in brazil 

emea 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2013 we experienced a continuation of many of the macroeconomic challenges we faced in emea in fiscal 2012 while we did see some improvements in most of the european economy as the fiscal year progressed we continued to see weakness in southern europe throughout fiscal 2013 for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  product revenue in the emea segment was flat as growth in the commercial service provider and public sector markets was offset by a decline in the enterprise market the growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due to our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 from a country perspective product revenue increased by 1 in the united kingdom 11 in russia 4 in switzerland and 3 in spain these increases were offset by product revenue declines of 3 in each of germany and france and 13 in the netherlands product revenue for italy was flat year over year 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  product revenue in the emea segment increased by 2  the increase was across most of our customer markets in the emea segment led by growth in the commercial enterprise and public sector markets we experienced a slight decline in product revenue in the service provider customer market during the fiscal year driven by lower revenue from this customer market in several of the large countries in the region from a country perspective product revenue increased by 11 in the united kingdom 15 in russia and 9 in the netherlands these increases were partially offset by product revenue declines of 23 in italy 21 in spain 2 in germany and 1 in france 

we believe that the slower growth we experienced in emea was a result of weak macroeconomic conditions attributable in large part to the austerity measures taking place in parts of the region in particular we experienced weakness in this segment during the second half of fiscal 2012 with a yearoveryear decline in product revenue in this segment during the fourth quarter 

apjc 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  product revenue in the apjc segment increased by 3  we experienced solid product revenue growth in the commercial and service provider markets and to a lesser degree in the public sector market the growth in product revenue in the service provider market was due primarily to our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 from a country perspective product revenue increased by 3 in australia 34 in india and 10 in south korea these increases were partially offset by product revenue declines of 5 in china and 7 in japan reflecting certain challenges that we faced in these countries during portions of fiscal 2013 most notably in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  product revenue in the apjc segment increased by 13  the increase was led by strong product revenue growth in the service provider market and to a lesser degree in the commercial enterprise and public sector markets from a country perspective product revenue increased by 27 in japan 17 in china and 12 in australia we experienced a yearoveryear product revenue decline of 19 in south korea and 4 in india our revenue decline in india was due to ongoing business momentum challenges in the public sector customer market 

product revenue by groups of similar products 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes our product categories consist of the following categories with subcategories in parentheses switching fixed switching modular switching and storage ngn routing highend routers midrange and lowend routers and other ngn routing products service provider video connected devices video software and solutions cable access and nds collaboration unified communications and cisco telepresence wireless data center security and other products the other products category consists primarily of emerging technology products and other networking products 

the following table presents revenue for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 



switching 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

product revenue in our switching category increased by 1  or 152 million  as higher sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches and storage products sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches increased by 4 or 366 million while sales of modular switches decreased by 1 or approximately 76 million the increase in sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches was primarily due to higher sales of cisco nexus series switches partially offset by sales declines in certain of our cisco catalyst product families sales of modular switches decreased due to lower sales of cisco catalyst 6500 series switches partially offset by higher sales in cisco nexus 7000 series switches product revenue in the switching category was also negatively impacted by a 24 decrease in sales of storage products 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  product revenue in our switching category increased by 3  or 412 million  the increase was primarily due to growth from transitioning products taking place in our switching product portfolio the impact of competitive pressures moderated growth primarily in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012 within our switching product category higher sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches and storage products were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches increased by 11 or 819 million while sales of modular switches decreased by 8 or approximately 468 million the increase in sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches was primarily due to increased sales of cisco catalyst 2960 series switches cisco nexus 2000 and 5000 series switches and the cisco catalyst 3750 series switches partially offset by decreased sales of cisco catalyst 3560 series switches product revenue in our switching category was positively impacted by a 12 increase in sales of storage products primarily stemming from strong growth in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012 sales of modular switches decreased primarily due to lower sales of cisco catalyst 6500 and 4500 series switches partially offset by increased sales of cisco nexus 7000 series switches 

ngn routing 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

sales in our ngn routing product category decreased by 2  or 152 million  driven by a 3 or 142 million decrease in sales of highend router products and an 8 or 58 million decrease in sales of other ngn routing products these decreases were partially offset by a 2 or 47 million increase in sales of our midrange and lowend router products within the highend router product category we experienced lower sales of our cisco crs1 and crs3 carrier routing system products and our legacy highend router products partially offset by continued adoption of our cisco aggregation services routers asr products higher sales in our midrange and lowend router products were driven by the continued adoption of our cisco integrated services routers isr platform the decline in sales of other ngn routing products was due to decreased sales of certain other routing and optical networking products 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  product revenue in our ngn routing product category increased by 2  or 196 million  the increase in sales of our ngn routing product category was driven by a 7 or 332 million increase in sales of highend router products partially offset by a 3 or 87 million decline in sales of our midrange and lowend router products within the highend router products category the increase was driven by higher sales of cisco crs3 carrier routing system products and higher sales of the cisco asr 9000 5000 and 1000 family of products these increases were partially offset by lower sales of cisco 7600 and 12000 series routers within the midrange and lowend router products category the decrease was related to the product transition taking place within our cisco isr products as the sales decline in our older generation products had a greater impact than the growth experienced with our cisco isr 1900 isr 2900 and isr 3900 router products in this category sales of other ngn routing products decreased by 6 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to decreased sales of other routing and optical networking products 

service provider video 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

our service provider video products category grew by 26  or 991 million  due primarily to the acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 higher revenue from our connected devices and higher revenue from our video software and solutions also contributed to the increase the increase in sales of connected devices products was primarily due to increased sales of cable settop boxes 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  sales of service provider video products increased by 10  or 346 million  due to growth in our service provider customer market from increased sales of settop boxes worldwide sales in connected devices increased by 19 or 408 million sales in video software and solutions increased by 18 or 39 million while sales in cable access decreased by 9 or 100 million 

collaboration 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

our collaboration product category continues to shift its focus to recurring revenue streams driven by saas offerings overall sales of collaboration products decreased by 6  or 237 million  primarily due to a decline in sales of cisco telepresence systems and to a lesser degree a decline in sales of unified communications products lower public sector spending in the united states as well as demand weakness in europe were significant drivers of the decline in sales of cisco telepresence systems we also experienced a decline in sales of unified communications products which was due primarily to lower sales of unified 

communications infrastructure products as a result of our sales emphasis on shifting towards products with recurring revenue streams 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  sales of collaboration products increased by 3  or 121 million  the increase was due to a 5 increase in sales of unified communications products primarily ip phones and collaborative webbased offerings partially offset by a 1 decrease in sales of cisco telepresence systems challenges in both the public sector and demand weakness in europe along with our execution challenges related to our sales coverage model contributed to the decrease in sales of cisco telepresence systems in fiscal 2012 

wireless 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

sales of wireless products increased by 31  or 507 million  this increase reflects the continued customer adoption of and migration to the unified access architecture of the cisco unified wireless network and also reflects increased sales of new products in this category as well as sales of products related to our acquisition of meraki 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  sales of wireless products increased by 19  or 259 million  these increases reflect the continued customer adoption of our wireless architecture and new product performance 

data center 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

we experienced strong growth in our data center product category which grew by 60  or 775 million  with strong sales growth of our cisco unified computing system products across all geographic segments and customer markets the increase was due in large part to the continued momentum we are experiencing with our products for both data center and cloud environments as current customers increase their data center buildouts and as new customers deploy these offerings 

to the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market we expect that in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  sales of data center products increased by 86  or 602 million  due to increased sales of cisco unified computing system products the increase was due to the momentum we are experiencing with our products for the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments as current customers increase their data center build out and new customer product purchases 

security 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

sales of security products were flat as higher sales in highend firewall products within our network security product portfolio were offset by lower sales of our content security products 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012  as compared with fiscal 2011  sales of security products increased by 13  or 150 million  these increases were primarily due to growth in our network security products driven by the recent update of our firewall security product portfolio 

other products 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

we experienced a 34  or 339 million  decrease in sales of other products due in large part to lower sales of our linksys products which product line we sold during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the decrease in sales of other products for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to lower sales of flip video camera products in connection with our decision in fiscal 2011 to exit this consumer product line 

service revenue by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 



fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

service revenue experienced solid growth across all of our geographic segments worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 6 and worldwide advanced services which relate to consulting support services for specific network needs experienced 16 revenue growth technical support service experienced growth across all of our geographic segments led by growth in our americas segment renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales provided an installed base of equipment being serviced which in concert with new service offerings were the primary factors driving these increases we experienced revenue growth in advanced services across all geographic segments led by growth in the americas segment advanced services revenue growth was driven by solid growth in both transaction and subscription revenues 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 service revenue experienced doubledigit percentage growth across all of our geographic segments worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 10 and worldwide advanced services experienced 20 revenue growth technical support services revenue grew across all of our geographic segments with strong revenue growth in our emea and apjc segments renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with recent product sales have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced which was the primary driver for these increases advanced services revenue also grew across all geographic segments with particularly strong growth in apjc the apjc revenue growth in advanced services was led by strength in the second half of fiscal 2012 and was driven by both subscription growth and transaction growth which was in part the result of the completion of several large multiyear projects in this region 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 



product gross margin 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 



1 productivity includes overall manufacturingrelated costs shipment volume and other items not categorized elsewhere 

product gross margin decreased by 10   percentage points compared with fiscal 2012 

higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable product pricing contributed to our decreased product gross margin percentage in fiscal 2013 these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments additionally our product gross margin for fiscal 2013 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold primarily as a result of revenue increases for our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products these impacts were offset by continued productivity improvements the productivity improvements were in large part due to increased benefits from cost savings particularly in certain of our switching and ngn routing categories in which product transitions have been taking place and were driven by value engineering efforts favorable component pricing and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes 

because the preceding factors largely offset each other the decline in our product gross margin percentage was largely driven by our acquisition of nds which resulted in higher amortization expense from purchased intangible assets along with costs resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired as part of that acquisition in addition during fiscal 2013 we incurred charges related to the tivo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter that were included as part of cost of sales the combined effect of these items was a negative impact to our product gross margin of 11 percentage points for fiscal 2013 

our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and could be adversely affected by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins such as cisco unified computing system products our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue and as was the case in fiscal 2013 and 2012 may be adversely affected by increased sales discounts rebates and product pricing attributable to competitive factors additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain which in turn could negatively affect gross margin if any of the preceding factors that in the past have negatively impacted our gross margins arise in future periods our gross margins could continue to decline 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 



1  beginning in fiscal 2013 we refined our methodology for presenting the items in the preceding table and accordingly certain reclassifications have been made to fiscal 2012 amounts to conform to the presentation made for the fiscal 2013 amounts 

in fiscal 2012 product gross margin decreased by 04  percentage points compared with fiscal 2011 the decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable product pricing which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments additionally our product gross margin for fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold primarily as a result of revenue increases in our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products and increased revenue in other lower margin products in fiscal 2012 we experienced a positive mix impact from the absence of the lower margin consumer related products due to our exit from the flip video camera product line in fiscal 2011 the negative impacts to product gross margin were partially offset by lower restructuring charges the absence of significant impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets lower amortization expense in fiscal 2012 and productivity improvements the productivity improvements were in part due to increased benefits from our value engineering efforts particularly in certain of our switching products favorable component pricing and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations 

service gross margin 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

our service gross margin percentage increased slightly by 01  percentage points for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012 although we experienced higher sales volume from growth in both advanced services and in technical support services the resulting benefit to gross margin was offset by increased cost impacts such as headcountrelated costs partner delivery costs and unfavorable mix the mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services business contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

our service gross margin percentage increased by 05  percentage points for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume for both technical support services and advanced services the benefit to gross margin of increased volume was partially offset by increased headcountrelated and partner delivery costs and unfavorable mix the mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services revenue contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2012 as compared with the prior year lower sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 also added to the increase in service gross margin 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 gross margin from technical support services was flat as the benefits from a 10 increase in revenue combined with lower supply chain costs were offset by higher headcountrelated costs for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 gross margin in advanced services increased primarily due to a 20 increase in revenue in fiscal 2012 partially offsetting the volume benefit were higher delivery team costs which were in part headcount related and higher partner delivery costs our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers’ networking devices applications and infrastructures 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 



1   the unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisitionrelated intangible assets sharebased compensation expense impacts to cost of sales from purchase accounting adjustments to inventory charges related to asset impairments and restructurings significant litigation settlements which consisted of 172 million recorded to cost of sales for the tivo patent litigation settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and certain other charges we do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

we experienced a gross margin percentage decrease in our americas and apjc segments while our emea segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase 

the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline due to the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing and also due to unfavorable mix impacts partially offset by productivity improvements 

the gross margin percentage increase in our emea segment was primarily the result of productivity improvements from lower overall manufacturing costs and to a lesser degree favorable mix impacts and higher service gross margin partially offsetting these favorable impacts to gross margin were negative impacts from higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing 

the apjc segment gross margin percentage declined due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing lower service gross margin and unfavorable mix impacts partially offsetting these factors were productivity improvements driven in large part by lower overall manufacturing costs and higher volume 

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 we experienced a gross margin percentage decline across all of our geographic segments as compared with fiscal 2011 

the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline with the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing being substantially offset by higher volume higher service gross margin lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs and favorable mix impacts significantly lower revenue from the consumer market resulted in a positive gross margin mix impact to the americas segment for fiscal 2012 

the gross margin percentage decline in our emea segment was primarily the result of unfavorable mix impacts higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing and lower service gross margin due to increased headcountrelated costs these decreases were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs and increased volume in this segment 

the apjc segment experienced the largest gross margin percentage decline of all of our geographic segments due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing lower service gross margin and unfavorable mix impacts these decreases were partially offset by increased volume and lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs 

factors that may impact revenue and gross margin 

product revenue may continue to be affected by factors including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty that have resulted in cautious itrelated capital spending in our enterprise service provider public sector and commercial markets changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions competition including pricefocused competitors from asia especially from china new product introductions sales cycles and product implementation cycles changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales variations in sales channels and final acceptance criteria of the product system or solution as specified by the customer sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our collaboration and data center product categories in addition service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including network design services and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the revenue related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition as we focus on new market opportunities customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support especially in certain emerging countries which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter revenue and operating results 

product revenue may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and internet businesses whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products adoption of new networking standards and financial difficulties experienced by our customers we may from time to time experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components resulting in delayed shipments to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter for additional factors that may impact product revenue see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

our distributors participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs increased sales to our distributors generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a certain degree the timing of orders from our customers we recognize revenue for sales to our distributors generally based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 

product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products introduction of new products including products with priceperformance advantages and new business models for our offerings such as xaas our ability to reduce production costs entry into new markets including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures as a result of internal development or through acquisitions changes in distribution channels price competition including competitors from asia especially those from china changes in geographic mix of our product revenue the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals sales discounts increases in material or labor costs including sharebased compensation expense excess inventory and obsolescence charges warranty costs changes in shipment volume loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing effects of value engineering inventory holding charges and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals sharebased compensation expense and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business 

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 



rd expenses 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

the increase in rd expenses for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  was primarily due to higher headcountrelated expenses attributable in large part to our acquisitions partially offsetting these costs was lower sharebased compensation expense for further explanation of the yearoveryear decrease in sharebased compensation expense see “sharebased compensation expense” below 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the decrease in rd expenses for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower headcountrelated expenses resulting from our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and lower sharebased compensation expense additionally rd expenses declined due to lower acquisitionrelated expenses which were driven by the absence in fiscal 2012 of certain compensation payments that were paid in the prior year 

sales and marketing expenses 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  sales and marketing expenses decreased by 109 million  primarily due to lower sharebased compensation expense and to a lesser degree lower discretionary spending and contracted services these items were partially offset by higher headcountrelated expense resulting largely from our acquisitions 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 sales and marketing expenses decreased by 165 million marketing expenses decreased by 204 million which were partially offset by an increase of 39 million in sales expenses the decrease in marketing expenses for the period was due to lower advertisement expenses lower headcountrelated expenses and lower sharebased compensation expense the increase in sales expenses was due primarily to higher projectrelated services partially offset by lower headcountrelated expenses and lower sharebased compensation expense the decline in headcountrelated expenses for both sales and marketing was in part attributable to our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

ga expenses 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

ga expenses decreased in fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  primarily due to the absence in the current year of 202 million of impairment charges on real estate held for sale recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 lower sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2013 and a recovery in the market value of property held for sale recorded during fiscal 2013 also contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by higher headcountrelated expenses resulting in part from our acquisitions and also by higher corporatelevel expenses corporatelevel expenses which tend to vary from period to period 

included operational infrastructure activities such as it project implementations which included investments in our global data center infrastructure and investments related to operational and financial systems 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

ga expenses increased in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to a net increase of approximately 300 million in real estate charges primarily for impairments on real estate held for sale followed by other increased corporatelevel expenses the increase in real estate charges in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to charges of 202 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 these increased corporatelevel expenses which tend to vary from period to period include increases related to our operational infrastructure such as real estate it project implementations which include further investments in our global data center infrastructure and investments related to operational and financial systems 

partially offsetting these increases were lower sharebased compensation expense and lower headcountrelated expenses due to the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011   

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2013 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 227 million  or approximately 13  compared with fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2012 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 90 million  or approximately 05  compared with fiscal 2011 

headcount 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

our headcount increased by 8410 employees in fiscal 2013  the increase was attributable to the headcount from acquisitions the largest of which was nds as well as targeted hiring in engineering and services 

in august 2013 we announced that we are rebalancing our resources with a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4000 employees or 5 of our global workforce see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

our headcount decreased by 5186 employees in fiscal 2012 the decrease was attributable to headcount reductions from the completion of the sale of our juarez mexico manufacturing operations and from our restructuring actions initiated in july 2011 partially offsetting these declines in headcount were headcount increases due to the growth of our service business and targeted hiring in engineering which includes the hiring of recent university graduates 

sharebased compensation expense 

the following table presents sharebased compensation expense in millions 



the yearoveryear decrease in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of sharebased awards granted in recent periods higher forfeiture credits in fiscal 2013 and the effect of stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the decrease in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of sharebased awards granted in recent periods the timing of the annual grants to employees in fiscal 2012 and stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses in millions 

the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2013  compared with fiscal 2012  was primarily due to amortization of purchased intangible assets from our acquisition of nds at the beginning of fiscal 2013 and from our other fiscal 2013 acquisitions partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized during fiscal 2013 the decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the absence of significant impairment charges during fiscal 2012 and also due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired in fiscal 2011 the impairment charges in fiscal 2011 were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain products from our then consumer product lines for additional information regarding purchased intangible assets see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

restructuring and other charges 

fiscal 2011 plans 

in connection with the fiscal 2011 plans see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements we incurred within operating expenses net restructuring and other charges of approximately 105 million  304 million  and 799 million  for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

august fiscal 2014 plan 

in august 2013 we announced a workforce reduction plan we are rebalancing our resources with a workforce reduction plan that will impact approximately 4000 employees or 5 of our global workforce we expect to take action under this plan beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 we currently estimate that we will recognize pretax charges to our financial results in an amount not expected to exceed 550 million consisting of severance and other onetime termination benefits and other associated costs 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as a percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 



in fiscal 2013 our results reflect solid execution on delivering profitable growth as we grew operating income faster than revenue in fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  operating income increased by 11  and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 11  percentage points the increases resulted from the following revenue growth of 6 continuing focus on expense management which resulted in lower sales and marketing and ga expenses as a percentage of revenue and lower restructuring and other charges 

in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 operating income increased by 31 as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 41 percentage points the increase resulted from revenue growth of 7 effective expense management that resulted in lower total rd sales and marketing and ga expenses as a percentage of revenue lower amortization of purchased intangible assets lower restructuring and other charges and lower sharebased compensation expense 

interest and other income net 

interest income expense net   the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 



interest income increased slightly in both fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012 as compared with the respective prior fiscal years the slight increases were primarily due to increased interest income earned on financing receivables partially offset by lower interest income from our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments as a result of lower average interest rates the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was attributable to the favorable impact of interest rate swaps and lower expense on our floatingrate notes as the benchmark london interbank offered rate libor decreased the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt 

other income loss net     the components of other income net are summarized as follows in millions 



fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

the decrease in net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2013  compared with fiscal 2012  was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2013  as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for the unrealized gains and losses on investments for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  the change in net losses on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to higher realized gains from various private investments partially offset by an increase of 23 million in our proportional share of losses from our vce joint venture the change in other gains losses net for fiscal 2013  as compared with fiscal 2012  was primarily due to an increase in donations and less favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2013  

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the decrease in total net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2012 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 the change in net losses gains on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to equity method losses related to our proportional share of losses from our vce joint venture increasing by 84 million for fiscal 2012 the change in other gains losses net for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to more favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2012 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates and expiration of or lapses in tax incentives our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 111  for fiscal 2013  compared with 208  for fiscal 2012  the net 97  percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a net tax benefit of 794 million or 71 percentage points due to a tax settlement with the irs and an increase in tax benefits of 144 million or 12 percentage points due to the retroactive reinstatement of the us federal rd tax credit in fiscal 2013 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 208  for fiscal 2012 compared with 171  for fiscal 2011 the net 37  percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to a smaller proportion of net income which was subject to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 and the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit on december 31 2011 partially offset by other items including a reduction in state taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends our contractual obligations and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments   the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 



the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operating activities of 129 billion  an increase from 115 billion  provided for fiscal 2012 and issuance of common stock of 33 billion  pursuant to employee stock incentive plans these sources of cash were partially offset by cash paid for acquisitions of 68 billion  cash dividends paid of 33 billion  the repurchase of common stock of 28 billion  under the stock repurchase program and capital expenditures of 12 billion  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of an increase in net income 

our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was 404 billion  and 425 billion  as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  respectively under current tax laws and regulations if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the united states were to be distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes the balance available in the united states as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  was 102 billion  and 62 billion  respectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire sourcefire which will reduce our current balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments available in the united states by approximately 27 billion  upon completion of the acquisition see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below 

free cash flow and capital allocation      in august 2012 as part of our capital allocation strategy we announced our intent to return a minimum of 50 of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock which objective we accomplished in fiscal 2013 

we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment the following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow in millions 



we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue excess tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

we consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases we further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to among other things invest in our business make strategic acquisitions repurchase common stock and pay dividends on our common stock after deducting capital investments a limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period in addition we have other required uses of cash including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net income provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do 

the following table summarizes the dividends paid and stock repurchases in millions except pershare amounts 



on september 3 2013 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 017 per common share to be paid on october 23 2013 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on october 3 2013 

accounts receivable net   the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions and dso 



our accounts receivable net as of july 27 2013  increased by approximately 25  compared with the end of fiscal 2012 our dso as of july 27 2013  was higher by 6  days compared with the end of fiscal 2012 primarily due to the timing of product shipments as a higher proportion of shipments were made in the latter part of the fourth quarter in fiscal 2013 

inventory supply chain   the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions except annualized inventory turns 



inventory as of july 27 2013  decreased by 11  from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2012 and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by approximately 4  on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were flat compared with the end of fiscal 2012 

the inventory decrease was primarily due to lower levels of manufactured finished goods which in turn was due in part to inventory sold as part of the sale of our linksys product line the increase in purchase commitments in fiscal 2013 as compared with fiscal 2012 was driven primarily by new product introductions and an increase in customer demand we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts 

our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers manufactured finished goods consist primarily of buildtoorder and buildtostock products 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule 

and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees   we measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue as of july 27 2013  our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows in millions 



financing receivables   gross financing receivables less unearned income increased by 9  compared with the end of fiscal 2012 the change was primarily due to a 10  increase in lease receivables and an 18  increase in financed service contracts and other partially reduced by an 8  decline in loan receivables we provide financing to certain enduser customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products services and networking solutions these financing arrangements include leases financed service contracts and loans arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets lease receivables include salestype and directfinancing leases we also provide certain qualified customers financing for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 

financing guarantees   in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed 

deferred revenue related to financing receivables and guarantees   the majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts the majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts which primarily relates to technical support services is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed a portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met 

borrowings 

senior notes    the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 



interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium interest is payable quarterly on the floatingrate notes we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 27 2013  

other debt  other debt includes secured borrowings associated with customer financing arrangements notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries and notes related to our investment in insieme networks inc “insieme” the amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was 31 million   and 41 million as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  respectively 

commercial paper  in fiscal 2011 we established a shortterm debt financing program of up to 30 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program 

credit facility  on february 17 2012 we terminated our thenexisting credit facility and entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on february 17 2017 any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus 050 bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or onemonth libor plus 100 or ii libor plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement as of july 27 2013 we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion andor extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to february 17 2019 

deferred revenue   the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 



the increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2013 reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals partially reduced by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue the increase in deferred product revenue was primarily due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 27 2013  in millions 



operating leases   for more information on our operating leases see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers   we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” as of july 27 2013  the liability for these purchase commitments was 172 million  and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 

other purchase obligations   other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt   the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities   other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 1748 million   and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 399 million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

other commitments 

in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 263 million  as of july 27 2013  compared with 120 million  as of july 28 2012  

insieme networks inc    in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we made an investment in insieme an early stage company focused on research and development in the data center market as set forth in the agreement between cisco and insieme this investment includes 100 million  of funding and a license to certain of our technology in addition pursuant to a november 2012 amendment to the agreement between cisco and insieme we agreed to invest an additional 35 million  in insieme upon the satisfaction of certain conditions as of july 27 2013  we owned approximately 84  of insieme as a result of these investments and have consolidated the results of insieme in our consolidated financial statements 

in connection with this investment we have entered into a putcall option agreement that provides us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in insieme in addition the noncontrolling interest holders can require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events if we acquire the remaining interests of insieme the noncontrolling interest holders are eligible to receive two milestone payments which will be determined using agreedupon formulas based on revenue for certain of insieme’s products we will begin recognizing the amounts due under the milestone payments when it is determined that such payments are probable of being earned which may occur in the first half of fiscal 2014 when such a determination is made the milestone payments will then be recorded as compensation expense by us based on an estimate of the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned pursuant to a vesting schedule subsequent changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned and the continued vesting will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately 863 million  this amount was increased from a previous maximum of 750 million as a result of the november 2012 amendment as the parties recognized that higher staffing levels may be necessary to perform additional product development the milestone payments if earned are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers these privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 27 2013  there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

vce is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with emc corporation “emc” with investments from vmware inc “vmware” and intel corporation vce helps organizations leverage bestinclass technologies and disciplines from cisco emc and vmware to enable the transformation to cloud computing as of july 27 2013  our cumulative gross investment in vce was approximately 507 million  inclusive of accrued interest and our ownership percentage was approximately 35  during fiscal 2013 we invested approximately 93 million  in vce we account for our investment in vce under the equity method and our portion of vce’s net loss is recognized in other income loss net as of july 27 2013  we have recorded cumulative losses since inceptions from vce of 422 million  our carrying value in vce as of july 27 2013  was 85 million  over the next 12 months as vce scales its operations we expect that we will make additional investments in vce and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership 

from time to time emc and cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of vce to indemnify third parties such as customers for monetary damages such guarantees were not material as of july 27 2013  

on an ongoing basis we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

securities lending 

we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis the average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2013 and 2012 was 07 billion  and 05 billion  respectively we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  we had no outstanding securities lending transactions we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements pending acquisitions stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities   we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july 27 2013  our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july 27 2013  we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers as of july 27 2013  77 of our fixed income securities balance consisted of us government and us government agency securities we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2013  and fiscal 2012  we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 bps or minus 150 bps was relevant the hypothetical fair values as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  are as follows in millions 

  





financing receivables   as of july 27 2013  our financing receivables had a carrying value of 79 billion  compared to 72 billion as of july 28 2012  as of july 27 2013  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately 01 billion respectively 

debt     as of july 27 2013  we had 160 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which consisted of 125 billion floatingrate notes and 1475 billion fixedrate notes the carrying amount of the senior notes was 162 billion  and the related fair value was 176 billion  which fair value is based on market prices as of july 27 2013  a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 525 billion of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of 04 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt which is not hedged 

equity price risk 

the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard  poor’s 500 index or nasdaq composite index these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

publicly traded equity securities   the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio excluding hedged equity securities if any potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 20 and 30 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of july 27 2013  and july 28 2012  are as follows in millions 





investments in privately held companies   we have also invested in privately held companies these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method as of july 27 2013  the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 833 million  compared with 858 million  at july 28 2012  some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 



we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2013 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging decreased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 227 million  or approximately 13  compared with fiscal 2012 and in fiscal 2012 they increased our combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 90 million  or approximately 05  as compared with fiscal 2011 to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities 



we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes

we conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography as we strive for faster decision making with greater accountability and alignment to support our emerging countries and our five foundational priorities as discussed later beginning in fiscal 2012 we organized our business into the following three geographic segments the americas europe middle east and africa “emea” and asia pacific japan and china “apjc” in fiscal 2011 we organized our business into four segments united states and canada european markets emerging markets and asia pacific markets the emerging markets segment then consisted of eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa and russia and the commonwealth of independent states as a result of the geographic segment change in fiscal 2012 countries within the former emerging markets segment were consolidated into either the emea segment or the americas segment depending on their respective geographic locations we have reclassified the geographic segment data for prior years to conform to the current year’s presentation for revenue and other information regarding these segments see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements

as part of our business focus on the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it our products and services are designed to help our customers use technology to address their business imperatives and opportunities—improving productivity and user experience reducing costs and gaining a competitive advantage—and to help them connect more effectively with their key stakeholders including their customers prospects business partners suppliers and employees we deliver networking products and solutions designed to simplify and secure customers’ network infrastructures we also deliver products and solutions that leverage the network to most effectively address market transitions and customer requirements—including in recent periods virtualization cloud collaboration and video we believe that integrating multiple network services into and across our products helps our customers reduce their operational complexity increase their agility and reduce their total cost of network ownership as a result of the recategorization of our product offerings in fiscal 2012 our products and technologies are grouped into the following categories switching nextgeneration network “ngn” routing collaboration service provider video wireless security data center and other products in fiscal 2011 our product categories consisted of routing switching new products and other products 

network architectures built on core routing and switching technologies are evolving to accommodate the demands of increasing numbers of users network applications and new networkrelated markets these new markets are a natural extension of our core business and have emerged as the network has become the platform for provisioning integrating and delivering an everincreasing array of itbased products and services 

strategy and focus areas 

we began in fiscal 2011 and had largely completed by the end of fiscal 2012 realigning our sales services and engineering organizations in order to simplify our operating model drive faster innovation and focus on our five foundational priorities 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that focusing on these priorities best positions us to continue to expand our share of our customers’ information technology spending 

we continue to undergo product transitions in our core business including the introduction of nextgeneration products with higher price performance and architectural advantages compared with both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors we believe that many of these product transitions are gaining momentum based on the strong yearoveryear product revenue growth across these nextgeneration product families we believe that our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute may enable us to improve our relative competitive position in many of our product areas even in uncertain or difficult business conditions and therefore may continue to provide us with longterm growth opportunities however we believe that these newly introduced products may continue to negatively impact product gross margins which we are currently striving to address through various initiatives including value engineering effective supply chain management and delivering greater customer value through offers that include hardware software and services 

we continue to seek to capitalize on market transitions market transitions relating to the network are becoming in our view more significant as intelligent networks have moved from being a mere cost center issue—that is where the focus is on reducing network operating costs and increasing networkrelated productivity—to becoming additionally and increasingly a platform for improved revenue generation as well as driving business agility and strategy execution 

  

market transitions for which we are primarily focused include those related to the increased role of virtualizationthe cloud video collaboration networked mobility technologies and the transition from internet protocol version 4 to internet protocol version 6 for example a market in which a significant market transition is under way is the enterprise data center market where a transition to virtualization  the cloud is rapidly evolving there is a continued growing awareness that intelligent networks are becoming the platform for productivity improvement and global competitiveness we believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market is accelerating due to changing technology trends such as the increasing adoption of virtualization the rise in scalable processing and the advent of cloud computing and cloudbased it resource deployments and business models these key terms are defined as follows 

 

  

 this virtualization and clouddriven market transition in the enterprise data center market is being brought about through the convergence of networking computing storage and software technologies we are seeking to take advantage of this market transition through among other things our cisco unified computing system platform and cisco nexus product families which are designed to integrate the previously siloed technologies in the enterprise data center with a unified architecture we are also seeking to capitalize on this market transition through the development of other cloudbased product and service offerings through which we intend to enable customers to develop and deploy their own cloudbased it solutions including softwareasaservice “saas” and otherasaservice “xaas” solutions 

the competitive landscape in the enterprise data center market is changing very large wellfinanced and aggressive competitors are each bringing their own new class of products to address this new market we expect this competitive market trend to continue with respect to this market we believe the network will be the intersection of innovation through an open ecosystem and standards we expect to see acquisitions further industry consolidation and new alliances among companies as they seek to serve the enterprise data center market as we enter this next market phase we expect that we will strengthen certain strategic alliances compete more with certain strategic alliances and partners and perhaps also encounter new competitors in our attempt to deliver the best solutions for our customers 

we believe that the architectural approach that we have undertaken in the enterprise data center market is adaptable to other markets an example of a market where we aim to apply this approach is mobility where growth of ip traffic on handheld devices is driving the need for more robust architectures equipment and services in order to accommodate not only an increasing number of worldwide mobile device users but also increased user demand for broadbandquality business network and consumer web applications to be delivered on such devices a key term in this mobilitycentered market transition is “byod” an acronym for “bring your own device” which in the context of it usage in companies universities and other organizations refers to the growing trend of employees customers students and others associated with such entities to bring and use their own laptop computers smartphones tablets or other mobile devices for their work or participation instead of using equipment provided by the organization 

  

with regard to this market transition to help such organizations meet the demands of increasing byod usage our product development strategy involves a comprehensive architectural approach that will allow for among other things a unified security policy across the whole organization a simplified operations and network management structure that understands application performance from a user’s perspective enhances troubleshooting capability and lowers network operating costs and an uncompromised user experience over the organization’s entire wireless and wired network that embraces use of any kind of device our mobilityrelated products and solutions reflect this architecturalbased approach 

other market transitions for which we are focusing particular attention include those related to the convergence of video collaboration and networked mobility technologies which we believe will drive productivity and growth in network loads and appear to be evolving even more quickly and more significantly than we had previously anticipated cisco telepresence systems are one example of product offerings that have incorporated video collaboration and networked mobility technologies as customers evolve their communications and business models more generally we are focused on simplifying and expanding the creation distribution and use of endtoend video solutions for businesses and consumers 

another market transition on which we are focusing is the move toward more programmable flexible and virtual networks this move to network programmability encompasses technologies such as softwaredefinednetworking and is focused on moving from a hardwarecentric approach for networking to a virtualized network environment that is designed to enable flexible applicationdriven customization of network infrastructures we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine applicationspecificintegratedcircuits “asics” with hardware and software elements together to meet customers’ total cost of ownership quality security scalability and experience requirements in our view there is no single architecture that supports all customer requirements in this area our strategy is targeted to address a broad range of specific customer use cases 

recently we announced an additional set of network programmability capabilities with the announcement of the cisco open network environment or cisco one including overlay network technology application programming interfaces “apis” and networkoperation tools called agents and controllers in our view this evolution is in its very early stages and presents an opportunity for cisco we intend to continue to drive internal innovation partner for codevelopment and make strategic investments to lead this evolution 

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements

other products 

our other products category primarily consists of linksys home networking products certain emerging technologies and other networking products 

service 

in addition to our product offerings we provide a broad range of service offerings including technical support services and advanced services 

technical support services help ensure that our products operate efficiently remain available and benefit from the most uptodate system software that we have developed these services help customers protect their network investments and minimize downtime for systems running missioncritical applications a key example of this is our cisco smart services offering which leverages the intelligence from cisco’s over fifty million devices and customer connections to protect and optimize network investment for our customers and partners 

advanced services are services that are part of a comprehensive program that is designed to provide responsive preventive and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs the advanced services program supports networking devices applications solutions and complete infrastructures our service and support strategy seeks to capitalize on increased globalization and we believe this strategy along with our architectural approach has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors 

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and the business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 or more of our net sales our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise service provider commercial and public sector 

  

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we strive to take advantage of the networkasaplatform strategy to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services primarily through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers 

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide they include regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also group media broadcast and contentproviders within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased services and contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our routing and switching optical security video mobility and network management products systems and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the scale and complexity of their networks which requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

commercial 

generally we define commercial businesses as companies with fewer than 1000 employees the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market are served by a combination of our direct salesforce and our channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or companies with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain these smaller companies within the commercial market are primarily served by our channel partners 

public sector 

public sector entities include federal governments state and local governments as well as educational institution customers many public sector entities have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment we sell to public sector entities through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners as well as selling directly to these customers 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2012 our worldwide sales and marketing departments consisted of 24507 employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in 93 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

  

distributors hold inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

financing arrangements 

we provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our financing arrangements include the following 

leases 

   loans 

financed service contracts 

for additional information regarding these financing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

product backlog 

our product backlog at july 28 2012 the last day of our 2012 fiscal year was approximately 50 billion compared with product backlog of approximately 45 billion at july 30 2011 the last day of our 2011 fiscal year the product backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our product backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net product sales for any future period 

  

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all of the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services we work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions investments and alliances we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking and communications products and services 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with the following companies or subsidiaries thereof 

accenture ltd att inc cap gemini sa citrix systems inc emc corporation fujitsu limited intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa johnson controls inc microsoft corporation netapp inc nokia corporation nokia siemens networks oracle corporation sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy services ltd vce company llc vmware inc wipro limited xerox corporation and others 

companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

  

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include alcatellucent arista networks inc arris group inc aruba networks inc avaya inc brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd citrix systems inc dell inc dlink corporation lm ericsson telephone company extreme networks inc f5 networks inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc logmein inc meru networks inc microsoft corporation motorola mobility holdings inc acquired by google inc in may 2012 motorola solutions inc netgear inc palo alto networks inc polycom inc riverbed technology inc and symantec corporation among others 

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were siloed due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standardsbased protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among our product categories which consist of switching ngn routing collaboration service provider video wireless security data center and other product technologies for this purpose our research and development expenditures were 55 billion 58 billion and 53 billion in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of focus are tied to our foundational priorities and include but are not limited to our core routing and switching products and the cisco unified computing system and other products related to the data center our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge such as ip version 6 nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing needs during fiscal 2012 we completed the sale of our manufacturing operations relating to settop boxes to a contract manufacturer located in juarez mexico in furtherance of our strategic objective to simplify our operating model we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider 

  

we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time defined as less than one year 




 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 instability in the global credit markets including the continuing european economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions such as changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions the world has recently experienced a global macroeconomic downturn and if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example during fiscal 2011 we experienced a decrease in spending by our public sector customers in almost every developed market around the world and we continue to see decreases in spending within certain categories of our public sector customer market 

we have been investing in priorities including our foundational priorities and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we have been realigning and are dedicating resources to focus on certain priorities such as leadership in our core routing switching and services including security and mobility solutions collaboration data center virtualization and cloud video and architectures for business transformation however the return on our investments in such priorities may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of the recent global economic downturn and related market uncertainty our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline which occurred in fiscal 2009 our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase 

  

costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products in fiscal 2010 this was attributable in part to increasing demand driven by the improvement in our overall markets and similar to what has happened in the industry the longer than normal lead time extensions also stemmed from supplier constraints based upon their labor and other actions taken during the global economic downturn additionally the earthquake and tsunami in japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and the flooding in thailand in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 resulted in industry wide component supply constraints longer manufacturing lead times in the past have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2011 and to a lesser extent in fiscal 2012 and may continue to decline and be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our newer product categories such as data center collaboration and service provider video in addition to longer sales cycles in the past we have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers over certain extended periods of time as market conditions have fluctuated sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition for example during fiscal 2009 we experienced a slowdown in service provider capital expenditures globally and in fiscal 2011 we experienced a slowdown in certain segments of this market including in capital expenditures by some service provider customers and in sales of our traditional cable settop boxes in our then united states and canada segment such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

  

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition virtual home products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 

 

  

  

  

 in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product categories such as data center and collaboration and in our priorities as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia 

  

especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 business of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas and in our view this trend may increase 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were siloed due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

  

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors and retail partners generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 

 

  

 a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products in fiscal 2010 the earthquake and tsunami in japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 and the flooding in thailand in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 resulted in industrywide component supply constraints although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred if similar situations occur in the future they could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past 

  

including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts a return to growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or reramping manufacturing capacity for highly complex products for example during fiscal 2010 we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products this was attributable in part to increasing demand driven by the improvement in our overall markets and similar to what is happening in the industry the longer than normal lead time extensions also stemmed from supplier constraints based upon their labor and other actions taken during the global economic downturn if shortages or delays persist or worsen the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future 

 

  

  

 manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments for example the earthquake in japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 resulted in industry wide component supply constraints and an increase in our purchase commitments which was attributable to us securing supply components as we made commitments to secure our near term supply needs increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins 

  

for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe the industry is evolving to enable personal and business process collaboration enabled by networked technologies as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multipleparty collaborative interaction would demand and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it for example in fiscal 2009 we launched our cisco unified computing system our nextgeneration enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing network storage access and virtualization resources in a single system which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center cisco unified computing system is one of several priorities on which we are focusing resources another example of a market transition we are focusing on is the move towards more programmable flexible and virtual networks in our view this evolution is in its very early stages and we believe the successful products and solutions in this market will combine asics hardware and software elements together 

the process of developing new technology including technology related to more programmable flexible and virtual networks is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking to collaborative systems does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce products related to network programmability such as softwaredefinednetworking products in a timely fashion or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours our business could be harmed furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share net sales and earnings the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our newer product categories such as data center and collaboration as well as those in our other products category that we identify as “emerging technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products 

  

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

in fiscal 2012 we largely completed a process commenced in fiscal 2011 to lower our operating costs and to simplify our operating model and concentrate our focus on selected foundational priorities we have incurred significant restructuring charges as a result of these activities the changes to our business model may be disruptive and the revised model that we adopt may not be more efficient or effective than the aspects of our business model that are being revised at the same time we believe the effect of these changes has provided a onetime productivity benefit that is not likely to be achieved on a regular basis our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing functions as we focus on our foundational priorities such as leadership in our core routing switching and services including security and mobility solutions collaboration data center virtualization and cloud video and architectures for business transformation we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or economic uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially 

  

adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 acquisitions may also cause us to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a 

  

failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunitiesfor example storage wireless security transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network and other areas within our newer products categories such as data center and collaboration emerging technologies and our prioritieswe will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets such as our entry into the consumer market has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in 

  

individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins from time to time we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners although sales in several of our emerging countries decreased during the recent global economic downturn several of our emerging countries generally have been relatively fast growing and we have announced plans to expand our commitments and expectations in certain of those countries as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations outside the united states including impacts from the global macroeconomic environment and continuing challenges in europe any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the recent global economic downturn and related market uncertainty including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business 

  

particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms 

however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be 

  

issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such 

  

regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales taxes on internet product sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of our current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect to an alleged underpayment of income taxes social taxes interest and penalties by a brazilian distributor the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 

  

2008 and the related asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to approximately 427 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes approximately 10 billion for interest and approximately 19 billion for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 28 2012 we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted tax claims against us are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for our alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against us and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have or may be affected by recent earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which has and could continue to disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have 

  

a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments during fiscal 2009 we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant 

  

transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 160 billion that mature at specific dates in 2014 2016 2017 2019 2020 2039 and 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 3 billion we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of july 28 2012 the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually except 125 billion of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of our current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes interest and penalties in addition to claims asserted by the brazilian federal tax authorities tax authorities from the brazilian state of sao paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 the brazilian federal tax authorities asserted an additional claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with respect to an alleged underpayment of income taxes social taxes interest and penalties by a brazilian distributor 

the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2008 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to approximately 427 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes approximately 10 billion for interest and approximately 19 billion for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 28 2012 we have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted tax claims against us are without merit and we are defending the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for our alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against us and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years 

on march 31 2011 and april 12 2011 purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against cisco and certain of its officers and directors the lawsuits have been consolidated and an amended consolidated complaint was filed on december 2 2011 the consolidated action is purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of cisco’s publicly traded securities between february 3 2010 and may 11 2011 plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for liability due to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation process we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any at this time 

beginning on april 8 2011 a number of purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in both the united states district court for the northern district of california and the california superior court for the county of santa clara against our board of directors and several of our officers the federal lawsuits have been consolidated in the northern district of california plaintiffs in both the federal and state derivative actions allege that the board allowed certain officers to make allegedly false and misleading statements the complaint includes claims for violation of the federal securities laws breach of fiduciary duties waste of corporate assets unjust enrichment and violations of the california corporations code the complaint seeks compensatory damages disgorgement and other relief 

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including intellectual property litigation while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for additional information regarding intellectual property litigation see “part i item 1a risk factorswe may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” herein

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011—financial performance 

net sales increased 7 with net product sales increasing 5 and service revenue increasing 12 total gross margin decreased by 02 percentage points primarily as a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing as well as unfavorable product mix shifts these negative impacts to gross margin were partially offset by lower manufacturing costs higher volume lower restructuring charges and lower amortization and impairment charges from purchased intangible assets as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 27 percentage points due to the expense reductions we implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and in fiscal 2012 general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to impairment charges on real estate held for sale operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 41 percentage points primarily as a result of our sales increase lower restructuring charges lower amortization of purchased intangible assets and operating expense management diluted earnings per share increased by 27 from the prior year a result of both a 24 increase in net income and a decline in our diluted share count of 159 million shares 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011—business summary 

our solid fiscal 2012 performance reflects continued execution on our plan to deliver profitable growth in a challenging global macroeconomic environment we grew profits faster than revenue as revenue increased by 7 while net income increased by 24 our net income increase was in part due to lower restructuring charges in the current fiscal year 

in fiscal 2012 revenue increased by 28 billion the americas contributed 15 billion of the increase led by higher sales in the united states apjc contributed 09 billion to the revenue increase led by strong sales growth in japan emea added 05 billion to the revenue increase in fiscal 2012 both our product and service categories experienced revenue growth across each of our geographic segments we encountered certain challenges from a geographic perspective such as those we identified in fiscal 2012 related to macroeconomic challenges in much of europe which are expected to continue in fiscal 2013 partially offsetting these challenges we saw solid growth in fiscal 2012 in certain emerging countries such as mexico and brazil within the americas china within apjc and russia within emea we believe our prospects in most emerging countries are strong and we plan to align more of our resources to meet expected further opportunities in these countries 

from a customer markets standpoint in fiscal 2012 we had solid revenue growth across the service provider commercial and enterprise markets the public sector customer market experienced flat revenue growth in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 global public sector spending was a challenge for us in fiscal 2012 particularly in the americas with lower us federal government spending and in parts of emea due to continued austerity measures taking place in parts of the region we expect these challenges in the public sector to continue into fiscal 2013 

in fiscal 2012 net product sales increased by 18 billion while service revenue increased by 10 billion data center products provided 06 billion of the increase in net product sales our core switching and ngn routing products collectively provided 06 billion service provider video provided 04 billion and wireless products contributed 03 billion of the increase these are key product areas for us which along with the service revenue contribution reflect in our view the success we are experiencing with our technology architectures and our ability to deliver customer solutions particularly in the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments 

with regard to profitability our profits grew faster than revenue during fiscal 2012 this was attributable to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue driven by the cost reduction efforts we began in fiscal 2011 and substantially completed in fiscal 2012 and lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2012 coupled with relative stability in our gross margin our product gross margin benefited from value engineering and other cost savings such as savings generated from price negotiations with our component suppliers 

in summary we achieved solid and profitable growth in fiscal 2012 and did so while encountering a challenging global macroeconomic environment we expect that we will continue to be impacted by some of the same 

  

challenges in fiscal 2013 in particular we expect to be impacted by continued weakness in the european economy lower global public sector spending especially with regard to the us federal government and european governments and a continued conservative approach to itrelated capital spending as our customers respond to this difficult macroeconomic environment 

fourth quarter snapshot 

for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 as compared with the corresponding period in fiscal 2011 net sales increased by 4 with net product sales increasing by 3 and service revenue increasing by 12 with regard to our geographic segment performance on a yearoveryear basis net sales increased by 7 in the americas decreased by 5 in emea and increased by 9 in apjc total gross margin decreased by 07 percentage points primarily as a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing as well as unfavorable product mix shifts partially offset by lower manufacturing costs and higher volume as a percentage of revenue research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses collectively declined by 16 percentage points for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 general and administrative expenses include 202 million of real estate charges primarily related to impairment charges on real estate held for sale operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 73 percentage points primarily as a result of lower restructuring and other charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and our sales increase diluted earnings per share increased by 64 from the prior year period primarily as a result of a 56 increase in net income and also to a lesser degree from a decline of 142 million in our diluted share count 

strategy and focus areas 

we began in fiscal 2011 and had largely completed by the end of fiscal 2012 realigning our sales services and engineering organizations in order to simplify our operating model drive faster innovation and focus on our five foundational priorities 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that focusing on these priorities best positions us to continue to expand our share of our customers’ information technology spending for a full discussion of our strategy and focus areas see item 1 business 

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 in millions except days sales outstanding in accounts receivable “dso” and annualized inventory turns 

 

 our product backlog at the end of fiscal 2012 was 50 billion or 11 of fiscal 2012 net sales compared with 45 billion at the end of fiscal 2011 or 10 of fiscal 2011 net sales 

  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 

  

  

  

 in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met when a sale involves multiple deliverables such as sales of products that include services the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met 

the amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and if so our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables according to the accounting guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification “asc” 605 revenue recognition  we use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price “vsoe” for each of those units when available we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the historical standalone transactions have the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately 80 of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15 of the median rates when vsoe does not exist we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multipledeliverable arrangements under the selling price hierarchy thirdparty evidence of selling price “tpe” will be considered if vsoe does not exist and estimated selling price “esp” will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of others in our markets and the extent of our proprietary technology varies among comparable products or services from those of our peers in determining esp we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering companyspecific factors such as geographies competitive landscape internal costs profitability objectives pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 

some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components such sales arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition  

  

as our business and offerings evolve over time our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly which could result in changes in selling prices including both vsoe and esp in subsequent periods there were no material impacts during fiscal 2012 nor do we currently expect a material impact in fiscal 2013 on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe tpe or esp 

revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements service support and other factors financing arrangements may include salestype directfinancing and operating leases loans and guarantees of thirdparty financing our deferred revenue for products was 37 billion as of each july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed which typically is from one to three years advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance our deferred revenue for services was 92 billion and 85 billion as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 respectively 

we make sales to distributors and retail partners which we refer to as twotier systems of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs if actual credits received by our distributors and retail partners under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

allowances for receivables and sales returns 

the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions except percentages 

 

 the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay and expected default frequency rates which are published by major thirdparty creditrating agencies and are generally updated on a quarterly basis we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts if a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which could have an adverse impact on our revenue 

the allowance for credit loss on financing receivables is also based on the assessment of collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of the credit allowances determined either on an individual or a collective basis when evaluating the financing receivables on an individual basis we consider historical experience credit quality and age of receivable balances and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay as discussed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements effective at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2012 we refined our methodology for determining the portion of our allowance for credit loss that is evaluated on a collective basis the refinement consists of more systematically giving effect to economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation we also began to use expected default frequency rates published by a major thirdparty creditrating agency as well as our own historical loss rate in the event of default determination of expected default frequency rates and loss factors associated with internal credit risk 

  

ratings as well as assessing economic conditions concentration of risk and correlation are complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our revenue 

both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible 

a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates the reserve for future sales returns as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 was 129 million and 106 million respectively and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

our inventory balance was 17 billion and 15 billion as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 respectively inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory as of july 28 2012 the liability for these purchase commitments was 193 million compared with 168 million as of july 30 2011 and was included in other current liabilities 

our provision for inventory was 115 million 196 million and 94 million for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 151 million 114 million and 8 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively on a combined basis the 44 million decline in our provisions for inventory and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the absence in the current fiscal year of charges we recorded in connection with the restructuring and realignment of our consumer business during fiscal 2011 if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties included in other current liabilities was 415 million as of july 28 2012 compared with 342 million as of july 30 2011 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 

  

the provision for product warranties issued during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 was 661 million 456 million and 469 million respectively the increase in the provision in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increased shipment volume of products with higher warranty costs and longer warranty lives and also due to increased warranty charges related to specific products if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our profitability could be adversely affected 

sharebased compensation expense 

sharebased compensation expense is presented as follows in millions 

 

 prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on march 17 2011 the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0 as we did not historically pay cash dividends on our common stock for awards granted on or subsequent to march 17 2011 we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our board of directors as of the grant date see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables for employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the riskfree interest rate and expected dividends as of the grant date for employee stock options we have historically used the implied volatility for twoyear traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the latticebinomial model for employee stock purchase rights we used the implied volatility for traded options with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights on our stock the selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility the valuation of employee stock options is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 

because sharebased compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for forfeitures if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our optionpricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year 

fair value measurements 

our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities collectively are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of 389 billion as of july 28 2012 compared with 369 billion as of july 30 2011 our fixed income investment portfolio as of july 28 2012 consisted primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

as described more fully in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments it encompasses three classes of investments level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and modelderived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 

  

our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data we use inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities we use such pricing data as the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 

the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 28 2012 we had no level 3 investments in our total portfolio as of july 28 2012 

otherthantemporary impairments 

we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these securities to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected we consider all available information including past events current conditions the remaining payment terms of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of underlying collateral 

for publicly traded equity securities we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were not material in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 there were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

we also have investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages as of july 28 2012 our investments in privately held companies were 858 million compared with 796 million as of july 30 2011 and were included in other assets see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies these investments are inherently risky 

  

because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 23 million 10 million and 25 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 was 170 billion and 168 billion respectively in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill there was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 for the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2012 the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was 173 billion for the americas segment 138 billion for the emea segment and 91 billion for the apjc segment we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of july 28 2012 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit as a result of the divestiture of our manufacturing operations in juarez mexico in fiscal 2011 we recorded an adjustment of 63 million to reduce goodwill associated with these operations 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were 12 million 164 million and 28 million during fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations research and development “rd” tax credits tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 208 171 and 175 in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax 

  

outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

results of operations 

fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 were 52 52 and 53week fiscal years respectively 

net sales 

the following table presents the breakdown of net sales between product and service revenue in millions except percentages 

 

 we manage our business primarily on a geographic basis organized into three geographic segments our net sales which include product and service revenue for each segment are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 

 

 fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 net sales increased by 7 within total net sales growth net product sales increased by 5 while service revenue increased by 12 our product and service revenue totals reflect sales growth across each of our geographic segments the sales increase was primarily due to the strong performance of our service offerings new product transitions taking place in switching and increased demand for our data center service provider video and wireless products 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and budgetdriven reductions in spending by government entities net sales by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions such as multipleelement arrangements the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the net sales related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the net sales of the relevant segment as has been the case in certain of our emerging countries from time to time customers require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support and this may occur in future periods which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue 

  

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net sales increased by 8 within total net sales growth net product sales increased by 6 while service revenue increased by 14 our product and service revenue totals each reflected sales growth across each of our geographic segments the sales increase was due to customer acceptance of the new product transitions taking place in our core switching and routing businesses sales growth in our collaboration data center wireless and service provider video product categories and the strong performance of our services solutions 

net product sales by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of net product sales by segment in millions except percentages 

 

 americas 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 net product sales in the americas segment increased by 5 the increase in net product sales was across most of our customer markets in the americas segment led by growth in the enterprise service provider and commercial markets we experienced a net product sales decline in the public sector market for the fiscal year within the americas segment net product sales to the us public sector were flat as lower net product sales to the us federal government were offset by higher net product sales to state and local government from a country perspective net product sales increased by 4 in the united states 10 in canada 21 in mexico and 14 in brazil 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net product sales in the americas segment increased by 6 net product sales increased 3 in the united states 31 in canada 20 in brazil and 8 in mexico the increase in net product sales was across all of our customer markets in the americas segment led by the net product sales growth in our commercial market followed by smaller increases in net product sales growth in the service provider enterprise and public sector markets net product sales to the us public sector decreased due to a decrease in sales to the us federal government while sales to the state and local government market were flat 

emea 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 net product sales in the emea segment increased by 2 the increase in net product sales was across most of our customer markets in the emea segment led by growth in the commercial enterprise and public sector markets we experienced a slight decline in net product sales in the service provider customer market during the fiscal year driven by lower revenue from this customer market in several of the large countries in the region from a country perspective net product sales increased by 11 in the united kingdom 15 in russia and 9 in the netherlands these increases were partially offset by net product sales declines of 23 in italy 21 in spain 2 in germany and 1 in france 

  

  

we believe that the slower growth we experienced in emea was a result of weak macroeconomic conditions attributable in large part to the austerity measures taking place in parts of the region in particular we experienced weakness in this segment during the second half of fiscal 2012 with a yearoveryear decline in net product sales in this segment during the fourth quarter 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net product sales in the emea segment increased by 6 the increase in net product sales in the european markets segment was primarily due to growth in the enterprise and service provider markets and to a lesser extent sales growth in the commercial market for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 sales to the public sector market were flat from a country perspective for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net product sales increased by approximately 17 in france 13 in the netherlands 2 in germany 1 in the united kingdom and 63 in russia and were flat in italy 

apjc 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 net product sales in the apjc segment increased by 13 the increase was led by strong net product sales growth in the service provider market and to a lesser degree in the commercial enterprise and public sector markets from a country perspective net product sales increased by 27 in japan 17 in china and 12 in australia we experienced a yearoveryear net product sales decline of 19 in south korea and 4 in india our sales decline in india was due to ongoing business momentum challenges in the public sector customer market 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net product sales in our apjc segment increased by 10 the increase was led by sales growth in the enterprise commercial and service provider markets and to a lesser extent sales growth in the public sector market from a country perspective net product sales increased by approximately 13 in india 11 in china 8 in australia and 7 in japan 

net product sales by groups of similar products 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes our product categories consist of the following categories with subcategories in parentheses switching fixed switching modular switching and storage ngn routing highend routers midrange and lowend routers and optical collaboration unified communications and cisco telepresence service provider video cable and cable modem video systems wireless security data center and other products the other products category consists primarily of linksysrelated products emerging technology products and other networking products 

  

the following table presents net sales for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 

 

 switching 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 net product sales in our switching product category increased by 3 or 401 million the increase was primarily due to growth from transitioning products taking place in our switching product portfolio the impact of competitive pressures moderated growth primarily in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012 within our switching product category higher sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches and storage products were partially offset by lower sales of modular switches sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches increased by 11 or 814 million while sales of modular switches decreased by 8 or approximately 469 million the increase in sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches was primarily due to increased sales of cisco catalyst 2960 series switches cisco nexus 2000 and 5000 series switches and the cisco catalyst 3750 series switches partially offset by decreased sales of cisco catalyst 3560 series switches net product sales in our switching product category were positively impacted by a 11 increase in sales of storage products primarily stemming from strong growth in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012 sales of modular switches decreased primarily due to lower sales of cisco catalyst 6500 and 4500 series switches partially offset by increased sales of cisco nexus 7000 series switches 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

net product sales in our switching product category were relatively flat in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 which was due to the combined effect of continuing transitions taking place in our product portfolio lower public sector spending and the impact of increased competitive pressures within our switches product category higher sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches partially offset lower sales of modular switches sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches increased 5 or 331 million while sales of modular switches decreased 5 or 306 million the increase in lan fixedconfiguration switches was primarily due to increased sales of cisco catalyst 2960 series switches and cisco nexus 2000 and 5000 series switches partially offset by decreased sales of cisco catalyst 3560 and 3750 series switches the decrease in sales of modular switches was primarily due to decreased sales of cisco catalyst 6500 series switches partially offset by increased sales of cisco nexus 7000 and cisco catalyst 4500 series switches net product sales increased 6 or 31 million in storage which was attributable to increased sales of our cisco mds 9000 product line 

  

ngn routing 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 net product sales in our ngn routing product category increased by 2 or 161 million the increase in sales of our ngn routing product category was driven by a 6 or 293 million increase in sales of highend router products partially offset by a 3 or 83 million decline in sales of our midrange and lowend router products within the highend router products category the increase was driven by higher sales of cisco crs3 carrier routing system products and higher sales of the cisco aggregation services routers “asr” 9000 5000 and 1000 family of products these increases were partially offset by lower sales of cisco 7600 and 12000 series routers within the midrange and lowend router products category the decrease was related to the product transition taking place within our cisco integrated services router isr products as the sales decline in our older generation products had a greater impact than the growth experienced with our cisco isr 1900 isr 2900 and isr 3900 router products in this category sales of other ngn routing products decreased by 6 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to decreased sales of other routing and optical networking products 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 growth in sales of our ngn routing product category was driven by a 7 or 294 million increase in sales of our highend routers within highend router products the increase was driven by higher sales of cisco asr 5000 products from our december 2009 acquisition of starent and higher sales of the cisco asr 1000 and 9000 products these increases were partially offset by lower sales of cisco 12000 and 7600 series routers for fiscal 2011 midrange and lowend routers sales decreased sales by 3 or 84 million compared with fiscal 2010 sales of other ngn routing products increased by 31 compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased sales of optical networking products 

collaboration 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 sales of collaboration products increased by 3 or 126 million the increase was due to a 5 increase in sales of unified communications products primarily ip phones and collaborative webbased offerings partially offset by a 1 decrease in sales of cisco telepresence systems challenges in both the public sector and demand weakness in europe along with our execution challenges related to our sales coverage model contributed to the decrease in sales of cisco telepresence systems in fiscal 2012 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

sales of collaboration products increased by 35 or 10 billion primarily due to the inclusion of tandberg sales within our cisco telepresence systems product line following our fiscal 2010 third quarter acquisition of tandberg and a 6 increase in sales of unified communications products primarily ip phones and collaborative webbased offerings 

service provider video 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 sales of service provider video products increased by 11 or 375 million due to growth in our service provider customer market from increased sales of settop boxes worldwide sales of video systems and other products increased by 13 or 316 million while sales of cable and cable modem products increased by 6 or 59 million 

  

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

sales of service provider video products increased by 6 or 189 million due to increased sales of cable and cable modem products of 20 due to strong customer market demand and increased sales of video systems products of 1 

wireless 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 sales of wireless products increased by 19 or 272 million these increases reflect the continued customer adoption of and migration to the cisco unified wireless network architecture and new product performance 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

sales of wireless products increased by 26 or 293 million which was primarily due to continued customer adoption of and migration to the cisco unified wireless network architecture 

security 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 sales of security products increased by 12 or 149 million these increases were primarily due to growth in our network security products driven by the recent update of our firewall security product portfolio 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 sales of security products decreased by 8 or 102 million our decreased sales of security products were the result of lower sales of module and line cards related to our routers and lan switches partially offset by increased sales of our web and email security products 

data center 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 sales of data center products increased by 87 or 604 million due to increased sales of cisco unified computing system products the increase was due to the momentum we are experiencing with our products for the enterprise and service provider data center and cloud environments as current customers increase their data center build out and new customer product purchases 

to the extent our data center business grows and further penetrates the market we expect that in comparison to what we experienced during the initial rapid growth of this business the growth rates for our data center product sales will experience more normal seasonality consistent with the overall server market 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

sales of data center products increased by 254 or 498 million due to sales growth of over 273 or 496 million of cisco unified computing system products 

other products 

the decrease in sales of other products for fiscal 2012 and 2011 as compared with the prior fiscal year compare periods was primarily due to lower sales of flip video camera products in connection with our decision in fiscal 2011 to exit this consumer product line 

  

net service sales by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 

 

 fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 service revenue experienced doubledigit percentage growth across all of our geographic segments worldwide technical support services revenue increased by 10 and worldwide advanced services which relates to consulting support services for specific network needs experienced 20 revenue growth technical support services revenue grew across all of our geographic segments with strong revenue growth in our emea and apjc segments renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with recent product sales have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced which was the primary driver for these increases advanced services revenue also grew across all geographic segments with particularly strong growth in apjc the apjc revenue growth in advanced services was led by strength in the second half of fiscal 2012 and was driven by both subscription growth and transaction growth which was in part the result of the completion of several large multiyear projects in this region 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

net service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments with apjc reporting strong revenue growth technical support services revenue increased 12 and advanced services experienced 21 revenue growth technical support service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments with particular strength in apjc growth in each of our americas and emea segments also contributed to the overall technical support service revenue growth we experienced revenue growth in advanced services across each of our geographic segments with strong growth in our apjc and emea segments followed by growth in our americas segment total service revenue growth also benefited from a full year of service revenue attributable to our acquisitions of tandberg and starent during fiscal 2010 

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 

 

   

product gross margin 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2012 

 

 in fiscal 2012 product gross margin decreased by 04 percentage points compared with fiscal 2011 the decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable product pricing which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of net product sales these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments additionally our product gross margin for fiscal 2012 was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold primarily as a result of sales increases in our relatively lower margin cisco unified computing system products and increased sales in other lower margin products in fiscal 2012 we experienced a positive mix impact from the absence of the lower margin consumer related products due to our exit from the flip video camera product line in fiscal 2011 the negative impacts to product gross margin were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing costs higher shipment volume lower restructuring charges the absence of significant impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets and lower amortization expense in fiscal 2012 the lower overall manufacturing costs were in part due to increased benefits from our value engineering efforts particularly in certain of our switching products favorable component pricing and continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes 

our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins such as cisco unified computing system products our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue or as was the case in fiscal 2012 and 2011 by increased sales discounts rebates and product pricing which may be attributable to competitive factors additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain if any of the preceding factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods our product and service gross margins could continue to decline 

  

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 

 

 in fiscal 2011 product gross margin decreased by 37 percentage points the decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable product pricing which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments additionally our product gross margin was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold as a result of revenue declines in our higher margin switching products coupled with revenue increases from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products higher yearoveryear impairment charges related to acquisitionrelated intangible assets and higher restructuring and other charges both primarily in the consumer business also contributed to the decline in our product gross margin percentage these negative factors were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing costs and by slightly higher shipment volume the lower overall manufacturing costs were in part due to favorable component pricing continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations and value engineering 

service gross margin 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

our service gross margin percentage increased by 05 percentage points for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume for both technical support services and advanced services the benefit to gross margin of increased volume was partially offset by increased headcountrelated and partner delivery costs and unfavorable mix the mix impacts were due to our lower gross margin advanced services revenue contributing a higher proportion of service revenue for fiscal 2012 as compared with the prior year lower sharebased compensation expense in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 also added to the increase in service gross margin 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 gross margin from technical support services was flat as the benefits from a 10 increase in revenue combined with lower supply chain costs were offset by higher headcountrelated costs for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 gross margin in advanced services increased primarily due to a 20 increase in revenue in fiscal 2012 partially offsetting the volume benefit were higher delivery team costs which were in part headcount related and higher partner delivery costs our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers’ networking devices applications and infrastructures 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

  

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

our service gross margin percentage increased by 15 percentage points for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 with both technical support services and advanced services experiencing higher gross margins the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume partially offsetting the volume increases were unfavorable mix impacts primarily due to advanced services representing a higher proportion of service revenue in fiscal 2011 and due to increased service delivery costs gross margin in technical support services increased primarily as a result of increased sales volume and lower headcountrelated cost impacts these benefits were partially offset by increased support service delivery costs particularly from outside services advanced services gross margin increased primarily due to strong volume growth partially offset by higher delivery team costs which were partially headcount related 

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 

 

  

 fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 we experienced a gross margin percentage decline across all of our geographic segments as compared with fiscal 2011 

the americas segment experienced a slight gross margin percentage decline with the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing being substantially offset by higher volume higher service gross margin lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs and favorable mix impacts significantly lower sales to the consumer market resulted in a positive gross margin mix impact to the americas segment for fiscal 2012 

the gross margin percentage decline in our emea segment was primarily the result of unfavorable mix impacts higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing and lower service gross margin due to increased headcountrelated costs these decreases were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs and increased volume in this segment 

the apjc segment experienced the largest gross margin percentage decline of all of our geographic segments due primarily to the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing lower service gross margin and unfavorable mix impacts these decreases were partially offset by increased volume and lower overall manufacturing and delivery costs 

  

the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 the gross margin percentage across all geographic segments declined primarily due to higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing as well as due to a product mix shift these declines were partially offset by the impacts from increased shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs across all geographic segments 

factors that may impact net sales and gross margin 

net product sales may continue to be affected by factors including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty that have resulted in reduced itrelated capital spending in our enterprise service provider public sector and commercial markets changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions competition including pricefocused competitors from asia especially from china new product introductions sales cycles and product implementation cycles changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales variations in sales channels and final acceptance criteria of the product system or solution as specified by the customer sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our collaboration and data center product categories in addition service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including network design services and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition certain of our customers in certain emerging countries also tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the net sales related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition as we focus on new market opportunities customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support especially in certain emerging countries which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results 

net product sales may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and internet businesses whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products adoption of new networking standards and financial difficulties experienced by our customers we may from time to time experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components resulting in delayed shipments to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter for additional factors that may impact net product sales see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs increased sales to our distributors and retail partners generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a certain degree the timing of orders from our customers we recognize revenue for sales to our distributors and retail partners generally based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 

  

product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products introduction of new products including products with priceperformance advantages our ability to reduce production costs entry into new markets including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures as a result of internal development or through acquisitions changes in distribution channels price competition including competitors from asia especially those from china changes in geographic mix of our product sales the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals sales discounts increases in material or labor costs including sharebased compensation expense excess inventory and obsolescence charges warranty costs changes in shipment volume loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing effects of value engineering inventory holding charges and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals sharebased compensation expense and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business 

research and development “rd” sales and marketing and general and administrative “ga” expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 

 

 fiscal 2010 had an extra week compared with fiscal 2011 we estimate that the extra week contributed approximately 150 million of additional research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expense in fiscal 2010 

rd expenses 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the decrease in rd expenses for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower headcountrelated expenses resulting from our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and lower sharebased compensation expense additionally rd expenses declined due to lower acquisitionrelated expenses which was driven by the absence in fiscal 2012 of certain compensation payments that were paid in the prior year 

we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

  

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the increase in rd expenses for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher headcountrelated expenses higher contracted services and increased depreciation and equipment expenditures the increase in depreciation expense was partially acquisition related 

sales and marketing expenses 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 sales and marketing expenses decreased by 165 million marketing expenses decreased by 204 million which were partially offset by an increase of 39 million in sales expenses the decrease in marketing expenses for the period was due to lower advertisement expenses lower headcountrelated expenses and lower sharebased compensation expense the increase in sales expenses was due primarily to higher project related services partially offset by lower headcountrelated expenses and lower sharebased compensation expense the decline in headcount related expenses for both sales and marketing was in part attributable to our restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased compared with fiscal 2010 due to an increase of 851 million in sales expenses and an increase of 179 million in marketing expenses both the sales expense and the marketing expense components of the category increased for fiscal 2011 due to higher headcountrelated expenses as well as higher outside services costs higher depreciation expense and increased sharebased compensation expense additionally marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased due to higher advertisement expenses 

ga expenses 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

ga expenses increased in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 primarily due to a net increase of approximately 300 million in real estate charges primarily for impairments on real estate held for sale followed by other increased corporatelevel expenses the increase in real estate charges in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to charges of 202 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 these increased corporatelevel expenses which tend to vary from period to period include increases related to our operational infrastructure such as real estate it project implementations which include further investments in our global data center infrastructure and investments related to operational and financial systems 

partially offsetting these increases were lower sharebased compensation expense and lower headcountrelated expenses due to the restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the decrease in ga expenses in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was due to lower real estate charges in fiscal 2011 and the absence of nonincome taxrelated expenses such as fees and licenses which were included in fiscal 2010 partially offsetting these items were higher headcountrelated expenses higher outside services costs for operational support areas and increased equipment depreciation and rent expenses 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2012 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 90 million or approximately 05 compared with fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2011 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 53 million or approximately 03 compared with fiscal 2010 

  

headcount 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

our headcount decreased by 5186 employees in fiscal 2012 the decrease was attributable to headcount reductions from the completion of the sale of our juarez mexico manufacturing operations and from our restructuring actions initiated in july 2011 partially offsetting these declines in headcount were headcount increases due to the growth of our service business and targeted hiring in engineering which includes the hiring of recent university graduates 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 our headcount increased by 1111 employees the increase being attributable to targeted hiring as part of our investment in growth initiatives partially offset by the impacts of our voluntary early retirement program and our restructuring activities which began to reduce our headcount in late fiscal 2011 

sharebased compensation expense 

the following table presents sharebased compensation expense in millions 

 

 the yearoveryear decrease in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was due primarily to a decrease in the aggregate value of sharebased awards granted in recent periods the timing of the annual grants to employees in fiscal 2012 and stock options awards from prior years becoming fully amortized and replaced with restricted stock units with a lower aggregate value see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the increase in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was due primarily to a change in vesting periods from five to four years for awards granted beginning in fiscal 2009 the timing of annual employee grants and the overall growth in headcount and number of sharebased awards granted on a yearoveryear basis 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses in millions 

 

 the decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets for fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to the absence of significant impairment charges during fiscal 2012 and also due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized or impaired in fiscal 2011 for fiscal 2011 as 

  

compared with fiscal 2010 the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets was due to impairment charges included in operating expenses of 92 million partially offset by lower amortization due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized the impairment charges in fiscal 2011 were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain of our consumer products for additional information regarding purchased intangible assets see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

restructuring and other charges 

in fiscal 2012 we incurred within operating expenses net restructuring and other charges of approximately 304 million consisting of 250 million of employee severance charges for employees subject to our workforce reduction and 54 million of other restructuring charges 

in fiscal 2011 we incurred within operating expenses restructuring charges of 799 million these charges included 453 million related to a voluntary early retirement program for eligible employees in the united states and canada 247 million related to employee severance for other employees subject to our reduction of our work force and 71 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets primarily as a result of the sale of our juarez mexico manufacturing operations we also recorded charges within operating expenses of 28 million related to the consolidation of excess facilities and other activities 

operating income 

the following table presents our operating income and our operating income as percentage of revenue in millions except percentages 

 

 in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 our results reflect solid execution on delivering profitable growth as we grew operating income faster than revenue operating income increased by 31 as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 41 percentage points the increase resulted from revenue growth of 7 effective expense management that resulted in lower total rd sales and marketing and ga expenses as a percentage of revenue lower amortization of purchased intangible assets lower restructuring and other charges and lower sharebased compensation expense 

in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 51 percentage points the decrease was primarily the result of the following a 26 percentage point decrease in gross margin higher total rd sales and marketing and ga expenses as a percentage of revenue and restructuring and other charges of 799 million 

  

interest and other income net 

interest income expense net the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 

 

 fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 the slight increase was due to increased income from financing receivables partially offset by the effect of lower average interest rates on our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments the decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt due to favorable hedging impacts 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2011 due to increased income from financing receivables partially offset by the effect of lower average interest rates on our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was due to higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 attributable to our senior debt issuance in march 2011 partially offsetting the impact of higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 is the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt during fiscal 2011 

other income net the components of other income net are summarized as follows in millions 

 

 fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the decrease in total net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 was attributable to lower gains on fixed income and publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2012 as a result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for the unrealized gains and losses on investments for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 the change in net losses gains on investments in privately held companies was primarily due to equity method losses related to our proportional share of losses from our vce joint venture increasing by 84 million for fiscal 2012 the change in other gains and losses net for fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily due to more favorable foreign exchange impacts in fiscal 2012 

  

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the increase in total net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities partially offset by lower gains on fixed income securities in fiscal 2011 these changes were the result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 the decline in net gains on investments in privately held companies was due to lower net equity method gains and lower gains on sales the decline was partially offset by lower impairment charges on investments in privately held companies impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 10 million and 25 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively the change in other gains and losses net for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to fiscal 2011 experiencing lower gains from customer lease terminations higher donations expense and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts 

provision for income taxes 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 208 for fiscal 2012 compared with 171 for fiscal 2011 the net 37 percentage point increase in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was attributable to a smaller proportion of net income which was subject to foreign income tax rates that are lower than the us federal statutory rate of 35 and the expiration of the us federal rd tax credit on december 31 2011 partially offset by other items including a reduction in state taxes 

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 171 for fiscal 2011 compared with 175 for fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2010 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit the “ninth circuit” withdrew its prior holding and reaffirmed the 2005 us tax court ruling in xilinx inc v commissioner  the net 04 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was attributable to the absence in fiscal 2011 of this tax benefit of 158 million or 17 percentage points offset by other items including the tax benefit of 188 million or 25 percentage points related to the retroactive reinstatement of the us federal rd credit 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet contractual obligations other commitments and the stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 

 

 the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operations of 115 billion an increase from 101 billion in fiscal 2011 significant uses of cash in fiscal 2012 included the repurchase of common stock net of the issuance of common stock related to employee stock incentive plans of 34 billion cash dividends paid of 15 billion capital expenditures of 11 billion and the paydown of shortterm debt of 557 million 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2012 as compared with fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of an increase in net income and a smaller increase in financing receivables in fiscal 2012 

our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries was 425 billion and 398 billion as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 respectively under current tax laws and regulations if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the united states were to be distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes the balance available in the united states as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 was 62 billion and 48 billion respectively on july 30 2012 subsequent to year end we completed our acquisition of nds group limited which reduced our current balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments held by various foreign subsidiaries by approximately 50 billion see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends 

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue excess tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

  

accounts receivable net the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions and dso 

 

 our accounts receivable net as of july 28 2012 decreased by approximately 7 compared with the end of fiscal 2011 our dso as of july 28 2012 was lower by 4 days compared with the end of fiscal 2011 the decrease in dso was due to an improvement in shipment linearity during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 

services billings have traditionally had the effect of increasing dso due in part to the timing of billings which in comparison to product billings have a larger proportion billed in the latter part of the quarter given various factors such as our business mix linearity and the growth of our service business going forward we expect dso to continue to be in the range of 30 to 40 days 

inventory supply chain the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions except annualized inventory turns 

 

 inventory as of july 28 2012 increased by 12 from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2011 and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers declined by approximately 10 on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 5 compared with the end of fiscal 2011 

the inventory increase was due to higher levels of manufactured finished goods in support of current order activity the decline in purchase commitments in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was due to the increased commitments we made in fiscal 2011 to secure our nearterm supply needs as a result of supply constraints resulting from the earthquake in japan we believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts 

our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers manufactured finished goods consist primarily of buildtoorder and buildtostock products 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity 

  

we record a liability included in other current liabilities for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory the purchase commitments for inventory are expected to be primarily fulfilled within one year 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees we measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue as of july 28 2012 our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows in millions 

 

 financing receivables gross financing receivables less unearned income increased by 9 compared with the end of fiscal 2011 the change was primarily due to a 22 increase in loan receivables and an 11 increase in lease receivables gross financed service contracts and other increased by 1 compared with the end of fiscal 2011 we provide financing to certain enduser customers and channel partners to enable sales of our products services and networking solutions these financing arrangements include leases financed service contracts and loans arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets lease receivables include salestype and directfinancing leases we also provide certain qualified customers financing for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services and advanced services our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 

financing guarantees in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed 

  

deferred revenue related to financing receivables and guarantees the majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts the majority of the revenue related to financed service contracts which primarily relates to technical support services is deferred as the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed a portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria not currently having been met 

borrowings 

senior notes the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 

 

 interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium interest is payable quarterly on the floatingrate notes we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 28 2012 

commercial paper in fiscal 2011 we established a shortterm debt financing program of up to 30 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes as of july 28 2012 we had no commercial paper outstanding under this program as of july 30 2011 we had commercial paper notes of 500 million outstanding under this program 

other notes and borrowings other notes and borrowings include notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries the amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was 31 million and 88 million as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 respectively 

credit facility on february 17 2012 we terminated our thenexisting credit facility and entered into a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on february 17 2017 any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus 050 bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or onemonth libor plus 100 or ii libor plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s financial services llc and moody’s investors service inc the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement as of july 28 2012 we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 20 billion andor extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to february 17 2019 

  

deferred revenue the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 

 

 the 8 increase in deferred service revenue in fiscal 2012 reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals partially offset by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue the slight increase in deferred product revenue was due to increased deferrals related to subscription revenue arrangements and to a lesser extent higher twotier deferred revenue which was due to improved shipment linearity to twotier partners during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 this increase was partially offset by decreased deferred revenue related to our financing arrangements 

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 28 2012 in millions 

 

 operating leases for more information on our operating leases see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventory supply chain” as of july 28 2012 the liability for these purchase commitments was 193 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 

  

other purchase obligations other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations 

longterm debt the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities other longterm liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 18 billion and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 133 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements partially offset by payments 

other commitments 

in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 120 million as of july 28 2012 compared with 192 million as of july 30 2011 

insieme networks inc in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we made an investment in insieme networks inc “insieme” an earlystage company focused on research and development in the data center market this investment includes 100 million of funding and a license to certain of our technology as a result of this investment we own approximately 86 of insieme and have consolidated the results of insieme in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 

in connection with this investment insieme and we have entered into a putcall option agreement that provides us with the right to purchase the remaining interests in insieme in addition the noncontrolling interest holders can require us to purchase their shares upon the occurrence of certain events if we acquire the remaining interests of insieme the noncontrolling interest holders are eligible to receive two milestone payments which will be determined using agreedupon formulas based on revenue for certain of insieme’s products we will begin recognizing the amounts due under the milestone payments when it is determined that such payments are probable of being earned which we expect may be in fiscal 2014 when such a determination is made the milestone payments will then be recorded as compensation expense by us based on an estimate of the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned pursuant to a vesting schedule subsequent changes to the fair value of the amounts probable of being earned and the continued vesting will result in adjustments to the recorded compensation expense the maximum amount that could be recorded as compensation expense by us is approximately 750 million the milestone payments if earned are expected to be paid primarily during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers these privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 28 2012 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

vce is a joint venture that we formed in fiscal 2010 with emc corporation “emc” with investments from vmware inc “vmware” and intel corporation vce helps organizations leverage bestinclass technologies and disciplines from cisco emc and vmware to enable the transformation to cloud computing as of july 28 2012 our cumulative gross investment in vce was approximately 392 million inclusive of accrued interest and our ownership percentage was approximately 35 during fiscal 2012 we invested approximately 276 million in vce we account for our investment in vce under the equity method and our portion of vce’s net loss is recognized in other income net as of july 28 2012 we have recorded cumulative losses since inceptions from vce of 239 million our carrying value in vce as of july 28 2012 was 153 million over the next 12 months as vce scales its operations we expect that we will make additional investments in vce and may incur additional losses proportionate with our share ownership 

from time to time emc and cisco may enter into guarantee agreements on behalf of vce to indemnify third parties such as customers for monetary damages such guarantees were not material as of july 28 2012 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

securities lending 

we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis the average daily balance of securities lending for fiscal 2012 and 2011 was 05 billion and 16 billion respectively we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 we had no outstanding securities lending transactions we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements 

  

stock repurchase program 

in september 2001 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program as of july 28 2012 our board of directors had authorized an aggregate repurchase of up to 82 billion of common stock under this program and the remaining authorized repurchase amount was 59 billion with no termination date the stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program reported based on the trade date is summarized as follows in millions except pershare amounts

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july 28 2012 our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july 28 2012 we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers as of july 28 2012 approximately 80 of our fixed income securities balance consists of us government and us government agency securities we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 bps or minus 150 bps was relevant the hypothetical fair values as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 are as follows in millions 

 

 impairment charges on our investments in fixed income securities were not material for fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 

debt as of july 28 2012 we had 160 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which consisted of 125 billion floatingrate notes and 1475 billion fixedrate notes the carrying amount of the senior notes was 163 billion and the related fair value was 188 billion which fair value is based on market prices as of july 28 2012 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 425 billion of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of 06 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt which is not hedged 

  

equity price risk 

the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard  poor’s 500 index or nasdaq composite index these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

publicly traded equity securities the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio excluding hedged equity securities if any potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 20 and 30 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of july 28 2012 and july 30 2011 are as follows in millions 

 

 impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were not material during the fiscal years presented 

investments in privately held companies we have also invested in privately held companies these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method as of july 28 2012 the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 858 million compared with 796 million at july 30 2011 some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 23 million 10 million and 25 million for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward and option contracts outstanding at fiscal yearend are summarized in us dollar equivalents as follows in millions 

 

 we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated in fiscal 2012 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 90 million or approximately 05 compared with fiscal 2011 and 03 in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables investments and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities 

 

 we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes

products and services 

as part of our business focus on the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it our products and services are designed to help our customers use technology to address their business imperatives 

  

and opportunities—improving productivity and user experience reducing costs and gaining a competitive advantage—and to help them connect more effectively with their key stakeholders including their customers prospects business partners suppliers and employees we deliver networking products and solutions designed to simplify and secure customers’ network infrastructures we also deliver products and solutions that leverage the network to most effectively address market transitions and customer requirements—including in recent periods virtualization cloud collaboration and video we believe that integrating multiple network services into and across our products helps our customers reduce their operational complexity increase their agility and reduce their total cost of network ownership our product offerings fall into the following categories our core technologies routing and switching new products and other products in addition to our product offerings we provide a broad range of service offerings including technical support services and advanced services our customer base spans virtually all types of public and private agencies and businesses comprising enterprise businesses service providers commercial customers and consumers 

our products are used individually or as integrated offerings to connect personal and business computing devices to networks or computer networks with each other—whether they are within a building across a campus or around the world our breadth of product and service offerings across multiple technology segments enables us to offer a wide range of products and services to meet customerspecific requirements we also provide products and services that allow customers to transition their various networks to a single multiservice data voice and video network thereby enabling economies of scale 

network architectures built on core routing and switching technologies are evolving to accommodate the demands of increasing numbers of users network applications and new networkrelated markets these new markets are a natural extension of our core business and have emerged as the network has become the platform for provisioning integrating and delivering an everincreasing array of itbased products and services 

we announced a plan in may 2011 which we began implementing in fiscal 2011 and expect to complete in fiscal 2012 to realign our sales services and engineering organizations in order to simplify our operating model and focus on our five foundational priorities 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that focusing on these priorities will best position us to continue to expand our share of our customers’ information technology spending 

we are currently undergoing product transitions in our core business and introducing nextgeneration products with higher price performance and architectural advantages compared to both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors we believe that many of these product transitions are gaining momentum based on the strong yearoveryear product revenue growth across these nextgeneration product families we believe that our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute may enable us to improve our relative competitive position in many of our product areas even in uncertain or difficult business conditions and therefore may continue to provide us with longterm growth opportunities however we believe that these newly introduced products may continue to negatively impact product gross margins which we are currently striving to address through various initiatives including value engineering effective supply chain management and delivering greater customer value through offers that include hardware software and services 

  

we continue to seek to capitalize on market transitions market transitions on which we are primarily focused include those related to the increased role of virtualizationthe cloud video collaboration networked mobility technologies and the transition from internet protocol version 4 to internet protocol version 6 for example a market in which a significant market transition is under way is the enterprise data center market where a transition to virtualization  the cloud is rapidly evolving there is a continued growing awareness that intelligent networks are becoming the platform for productivity improvement and global competitiveness we believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market is accelerating due to changing technology trends such as the increasing adoption of virtualization the rise in scalable processing and the advent of cloud computing and cloudbased it resource deployments and business models these key terms are defined as follows 

virtualization refers to the process of aggregating the current siloed data center resources into unified shared resource pools that can be dynamically delivered to applications on demand thus enabling the ability to move content and applications between devices and the network 

the cloud refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which resources such as servers or software applications are no longer tethered to a user’s physical infrastructure but instead are delivered to and consumed by the user “on demand” as an internetbased service whether singularly or with multiple other users simultaneously 

this virtualization and clouddriven market transition in the enterprise data center market is being brought about through the convergence of networking computing storage and software technologies we are seeking to take advantage of this market transition through among other things our cisco unified computing system platform and cisco nexus product families which are designed to integrate the previously siloed technologies in the enterprise data center with a unified architecture we are also seeking to capitalize on this market transition through the development of other cloudbased product and service offerings through which we intend to enable customers to develop and deploy their own cloudbased it solutions including softwareasaservice saas and otherasaservice xaas solutions 

the competitive landscape in the enterprise data center market is changing very large wellfinanced and aggressive competitors are each bringing their own new class of products to address this new market we expect this competitive market trend to continue with respect to this market we believe the network will be the intersection of innovation through an open ecosystem and standards we expect to see acquisitions further industry consolidation and new alliances among companies as they seek to serve the enterprise data center market as we enter this next market phase we expect that we will strengthen certain strategic alliances compete more with certain strategic alliances and partners and perhaps also encounter new competitors in our attempt to deliver the best solutions for our customers 

other market transitions on which we are focusing particular attention include those related to the increased role of video collaboration and networked mobility technologies the key market transitions relative to the convergence of video collaboration and networked mobility technologies which we believe will drive productivity and growth in network loads appear to be evolving even more quickly and more significantly than we had previously anticipated cisco telepresence systems are one example of product offerings that have incorporated video collaboration and networked mobility technologies as customers evolve their communications and business models we are focused on simplifying and expanding the creation distribution and use of endtoend video solutions for businesses and consumers 

we believe that the architectural approach that has served us well in the past in addressing market opportunities in the communications and it industry will be adaptable to other markets an example of a market where we aim to apply this approach is mobility where growth of ip traffic on handheld devices is driving the need for more robust architectures equipment and services in order to accommodate not only an increasing number of worldwide mobile device users but also increased user demand for broadbandquality business network and consumer web applications to be delivered on such devices 

  

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

our current offerings fall into several categories 

routing 

routing technology is fundamental to the internet and this technology interconnects public and private ip networks for mobile data voice and video applications our routing products are designed to enhance the intelligence security reliability scalability and level of performance in the transmission of information and mediarich applications we offer a broad range of routers from core network infrastructure and mobile internet network for service providers and enterprises to access routers for branch offices and for telecommuters and consumers at home key products within our routing category are the cisco 800 1900 2900 and 3900 series integrated services routers as well as the cisco aggregation services routers asr 1000 5000 and 9000 series cisco 7600 and 12000 series routers and the cisco carrier routing system crs crs1 and crs3 

during fiscal 2011 we introduced enhancements to the asr 9000 system which complement the cisco crs3 located in the core of the nextgeneration internet we believe these new enhancements will help enable compelling new experiences for consumers new revenue opportunities for service providers and new ways to collaborate in the workplace 

switching 

switching is another integral networking technology used in campuses branch offices and data centers switches are used within buildings in localarea networks lans and across great distances in widearea networks wans our switching products offer many forms of connectivity to end users workstations ip phones access points and servers and also function as aggregators on lans and wans our switching systems employ several widely used technologies including ethernet power over ethernet fibre channel over ethernet fcoe packet over synchronous optical network and multiprotocol label switching many of our switches are designed to support an integrated set of advanced services allowing organizations to be more efficient by using one switch for multiple networking functions rather than multiple switches to accomplish the same functions cisco offers a comprehensive family of ethernet switching solutions from fixedconfiguration to cover a range of deployments in small and mediumsized businesses to modular switches for enterprises and service providers our fixedconfiguration switches are designed to provide a foundation for converged data voice and video services they range from small standalone switches to stackable models that function as a single scalable switching unit modular switches offer flexibility for enterprises which due to largescale network demands often need to deploy numerous concurrent intelligent networking services without degrading overall performance key products within our switching category are the cisco catalyst 2960 3560 3750 4500 4900 and 6500 series the nexus 1000v 3000 4000 5000 and 7000 series switches and cisco nexus 2000 series fabric extenders 

during fiscal 2011 we continued to enhance our fixed configuration and modular switches to deliver key network services that are designed to work with cisco routing security and wireless products to enable video collaboration enterprisewide energy management and policybased security in fiscal 2011 we also continued to expand on the cisco catalyst 4500 processor module by adding a new supervisor engine and features such as universal power over ethernet to power new applications such as thin clients this supervisor engine is designed to achieve borderless network access and priceperformance aggregation deployments providing increased fiber density along with hardware capabilities to support aggregation functionalities in addition we introduced capabilities in the nexus 7000 for scale and convergence such as fabricpath and directorclass fcoe additionally we completely refreshed our flagship catalyst 6500 platform tripling the performance quadrupling the scalability and adding new services to the platform

in addition to our product offerings we provide a broad range of service offerings including technical support services and advanced services technical support services help ensure that our products operate efficiently remain available and benefit from the most uptodate system software these services help customers protect their network investments and minimize downtime for systems running missioncritical applications advanced services are services that are part of a comprehensive program that is designed to provide responsive preventive 

  

and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs the advanced services program supports networking devices applications solutions and complete infrastructures our service and support strategy seeks to capitalize on increased globalization and we believe this strategy along with our architectural approach has the potential to further differentiate us from competitors 

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and the business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise service provider commercial and consumer 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment our enterprise customers also include public sector entities and governments we strive to take advantage of the networkasaplatform strategy to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners 

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide they include regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also group media broadcast and contentproviders within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased services and contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our routing and switching optical security video connected home mobility and network management products systems and services for their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers these technologies include cisco unified communications and call center products and applications cisco webex collaboration tools and cisco telepresence systems products as well as other video and security products and systems that can be incorporated into networkattached data centers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the scale and complexity of their networks which requirements are addressed we believe by our architectural approach 

commercial 

generally we define commercial businesses as companies with fewer than 1000 employees the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market are served by a combination of our direct salesforce and our channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or companies with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain these smaller companies within the commercial market are primarily served by our channel partners 

consumer 

our consumer customers are individuals who use the network at home or while away from home for personal use to enjoy a broad range of entertainment communications and information experiences cisco’s primary 

  

strategy for serving the consumer market is through its service provider customers and to a lesser extent through major consumer channels including through both traditional and online retailers through our website and through value added resellers 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2011 our worldwide sales and marketing department consisted of approximately 25898 employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in approximately 95 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors hold inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

we provide financing arrangements such as leases financed service contracts and loans for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects leases include salestype direct financing and operating leases we also provide certain qualified customers with the option of financing longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services and typically range from one to three years our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing for the acquisition of our products and services but also may provide additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services for additional information regarding these financing arrangements see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

product backlog 

our product backlog at july 30 2011 the last day of our 2011 fiscal year was approximately 43 billion compared with product backlog of approximately 41 billion at july 31 2010 the last day of our 2010 fiscal year the product backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our product backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net product sales for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all of the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services we work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions investments and alliances we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking and communications products and services 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with accenture ltd att inc cap gemini sa citrix systems inc emc corporation fujitsu limited intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa johnson controls inc microsoft corporation netapp inc nokia corporation nokia siemens networks oracle corporation sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy services ltd vmware inc wipro limited xerox corporation and others companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully 

  

discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new products markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include alcatellucent arista networks inc arris group inc aruba networks inc avaya inc brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd citrix systems inc dell inc dlink corporation lm ericsson telephone company extreme networks inc f5 networks inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc logmein inc meru networks inc microsoft corporation motorola mobility holdings inc motorola solutions inc netgear inc polycom inc riverbed technology inc and symantec corporation among others 

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were siloed due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among routers switches new products and other product technologies for this purpose our research and development expenditures were 58 billion 53 billion and 52 billion in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of focus are tied to our foundational priorities and include but are not limited to our core routing and switching products cisco telepresence systems products and the cisco unified computing system our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge such as ip version 6 nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we rely on contract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing needs we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding 

  

capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time defined as less than one year 

although we employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy as of july 30 2011 we operated manufacturing facilities in juarez mexico for the manufacture of settop boxes we have entered into an agreement to sell these manufacturing operations to a contract manufacturer consistent with our strategic objective of simplifying our operating model the transaction is expected to be completed in fiscal 2012 




 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 instability in the global credit markets including the recent european economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions such as changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions the world has recently experienced a global macroeconomic downturn and if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment for example during fiscal 2011 we experienced and continue to see a decrease in spending by our public sector customers in almost every developed market around the world 

we have been investing in priorities including our foundational priorities and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we have been realigning and are dedicating resources to focus on certain priorities such as leadership in our core routing switching and services including security and mobility solutions collaboration data center virtualization and cloud video and architectures for business transformation however the return on our investments in such priorities may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of the recent global economic downturn and related market uncertainty our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline which occurred in fiscal 2009 our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which 

  

overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which we and our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products in fiscal 2010 this was attributable in part to increasing demand driven by the improvement in our overall markets and similar to what has happened in the industry the longer than normal lead time extensions also stemmed from supplier constraints based upon their labor and other actions taken during the global economic downturn we continue to see challenges at some of our component suppliers additionally the earthquake and tsunami in japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 resulted in industry wide component supply constraints longer manufacturing lead times in the past have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results in addition when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2011 and may continue to decline and be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products in our new products category in addition to longer sales cycles in the past we have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers over certain extended periods of time as market conditions have fluctuated sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition for example during fiscal 2009 we experienced a slowdown in service provider capital expenditures globally and in fiscal 2011 we experienced a slowdown in certain segments of this market including in capital expenditures by some service provider customers and in sales of our traditional cable settop boxes in our united states and canada segment such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

  

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 

 

  

  

  

 in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in markets for our new products and in our priorities as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have 

  

experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 business of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were siloed due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the application of these converging technologies is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

  

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors and retail partners generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we continue to see challenges at some of our component suppliers and when facing component supplyrelated challenges have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 

 

  

 a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products in fiscal 2010 and we continue to see challenges at some of our component suppliers additionally the earthquake and tsunami in japan resulted in industry wide component supply constraints although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions if the conditions resulting from the japan situation worsen these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past 

  

including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts a return to growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or reramping manufacturing capacity for highly complex products for example during fiscal 2010 we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products and we continue to see challenges at some of our component suppliers this was attributable in part to increasing demand driven by the improvement in our overall markets and similar to what is happening in the industry the longer than normal lead time extensions also stemmed from supplier constraints based upon their labor and other actions taken during the global economic downturn if shortages or delays persist or worsen the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future 

 

  

  

 manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed when facing component supplyrelated challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments for example the earthquake in japan during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 resulted in industry wide component supply constraints and approximately 300 million of our purchase commitment increase was attributable to us securing supply components as we made commitments to secure our near term supply needs increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our 

  

gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 

our key manufacturing facilities for scientificatlanta’s products are located in juarez mexico and we may be materially and adversely affected by any prolonged disruption in the operation of these facilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we entered into an agreement to sell these manufacturing operations to one of our contract manufacturers 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe the industry is evolving to enable personal and business process collaboration enabled by networked technologies as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multipleparty collaborative interaction would demand and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it in fiscal 2009 we launched our cisco unified computing system our nextgeneration enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing network storage access and virtualization resources in a single system which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center cisco unified computing system is one of several priorities on which we are focusing resources 

the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in our priorities to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking to collaborative systems does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share net sales and earnings the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies in our new products category and those in our other products category that we identify as “emerging technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as 

  

inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

in fiscal 2011 we announced and began implementing restructuring activities designed to lower our operating costs and to simplify our operating model and concentrate our focus on selected foundational priorities we have incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and will continue to incur in the near term significant restructuring charges as a result of these activities the changes to our business model may be disruptive and the revised model that we adopt may not be more efficient or effective than the aspects of our business model that are being revised our restructuring activities including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing functions as we focus on our foundational priorities such as leadership in our core routing switching and services including security and mobility solutions collaboration data center virtualization and cloud video and architectures for business transformation we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or economic uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

  

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 acquisitions may also cause us to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

  

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities—for example storage wireless security transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network and other areas within our new products category emerging technologies and our priorities—we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging countries demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets such as our entry into the consumer market has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins in the past we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had 

  

shipped although the cost of such remediation has not been material in the past there can be no assurance that such a remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners although sales in several of our emerging countries decreased during the recent global economic downturn several of our emerging countries generally have been relatively fast growing and we have announced plans to expand our commitments and expectations in certain of those countries as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political economic or other factors relating to our operations outside the united states any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the recent global economic downturn and related market uncertainty including increased demand from customers in certain emerging countries we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

  

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not 

  

dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales taxes on internet product sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the 

  

internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of our current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes and related penalties the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and the related asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregated to approximately 522 million for the alleged evasion of import taxes 

  

approximately 860 million for interest and approximately 24 billion for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 30 2011 we have completed a thorough review of the matter and believe the asserted tax claims against us are without merit and we intend to defend the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for our alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against us and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have or may be affected by recent earthquake and tsunami activity which has and could continue to disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet 

  

with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments during fiscal 2009 we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors 

  

may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt 

we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 160 billion that mature at specific dates in 2014 2016 2017 2019 2020 2039 and 2040 we have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue shortterm unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 3 billion and had commercial paper notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of 500 million as of july 30 2011 the outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually except 125 billion of the notes which bears interest at a floating rate payable quarterly the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to repay all of our notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of our current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes and related penalties in addition to claims asserted during prior fiscal years by brazilian federal tax authorities tax authorities from the brazilian state of sao paulo asserted similar claims on the same legal basis during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 

the asserted claims by brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of sao paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007 the total asserted claims by brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregated to approximately 522 million for the alleged evasion of import taxes approximately 860 million for interest and approximately 24 billion for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 30 2011 we have completed a thorough review of the matter and believe the asserted tax claims against us are without merit and we intend to defend the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for our alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against us and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years 

on march 31 2011 a purported shareholder class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against cisco and certain of its officers and directors a second lawsuit with substantially similar allegations was filed with the same court on april 12 2011 against cisco and certain of its officers and directors the lawsuits are purportedly brought on behalf of those who purchased cisco’s publicly traded securities between may 12 2010 and february 9 2011 and between february 3 2010 and february 9 2011 respectively plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements during quarterly earnings calls purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for liability due to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation process we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any at this time 

beginning in april 2011 purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in both the united states district court for the northern district of california and the california superior court for the county of santa clara against our board of directors and several of our officers for allowing management to make allegedly false statements during earnings calls our management of the stock repurchase program is also alleged to have breached a fiduciary duty the complaints include claims for violation of the federal securities laws breach of fiduciary duty aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets unjust enrichment and violations of the california corporations code the complaint seeks compensatory damages disgorgement and other relief 

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including intellectual property litigation while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for additional information regarding intellectual property litigation see “part i item 1a risk factors—we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” herein

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

net sales increased 8 with net product sales increasing 6 and service revenue increasing 14 we experienced net sales increases across each of our geographic segments for both product and service revenue total gross margin declined by 26 percentage points primarily as a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing product mix shifts increased amortization and impairment charges from acquisitionrelated intangible assets and restructuring charges as a percentage of revenue the total for research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses increased by 07 percentage points primarily as a result of increased headcountrelated costs total charges for restructuring and other in fiscal 2011 totaled 923 million which consisted of 124 million recorded to cost of sales and 799 million recorded to operating expenses diluted earnings per share decreased by 12 a result of a 16 decrease in net income partially offset by a decline in our diluted share count of 285 million shares for further details see our discussion of fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 beginning on page 50 

during fiscal 2011 net sales increased as compared to fiscal 2010 however our results for the year reflect the effects of certain challenges that we faced we identified challenges with the public sector market early in the year and we continued to experience declining business momentum with that market throughout the year as spending reductions were being taken across virtually all developed markets in the service provider market we experienced challenges in sales of traditional settop boxes in addition we experienced challenges with regard to switching as switching revenue was flat for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 we believe the performance in switching was due to continued transitions taking place in our product portfolio the lower public sector spending and the impact of increased competitive pressures in fiscal 2011 switching gross margins declined on a yearoveryear basis due to the transition of products at the highend of the portfolio we also identified significant pressures in our consumer market during the fiscal year and addressed these issues with targeted actions as discussed below 

beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we initiated a number of key targeted actions that are intended to accomplish the following simplify and focus our organization and operating model align our cost structure to the transitions in the marketplace divest or exit underperforming operations and deliver value to our shareholders we are taking these actions to align our business based on five foundational priorities leadership in our core business routing switching and associated services which includes comprehensive security and mobility solutions collaboration data center virtualization and cloud video and architectures for business transformation in connection with these activities we incurred restructuring and other charges as discussed above in the second half of fiscal 2011 and we have announced that we will incur additional charges in fiscal 2012 these actions include implementing a voluntary early retirement program effecting a workforce reduction and realigning and restructuring our consumer business most notably exiting our flip video cameras product line we anticipate that our total expense reduction actions will reduce our annualized operating expense run rate by approximately 1 billion with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 operating expenses as our base we expect to achieve this annualized run rate reduction target within fiscal 2012 

while we experienced the challenges outlined above there were several positive aspects to our fiscal 2011 performance for fiscal 2011 the emerging markets segment experienced revenue growth of 14 we had strong growth in our commercial market and in our enterprise market excluding the public sector positive aspects of our results for fiscal 2011 also included revenue growth in new products of 14 with strong growth of 31 in collaboration which includes the impact of the tandberg asa “tandberg” acquisition completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and 44 in data center both key strategic areas for us for fiscal 2011 service revenue increased by 14 in addition as we focused on and addressed the items that impacted our financial performance in the first three quarters of fiscal 2011 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 there was improvement in our general business momentum 

  

strategy and focus areas 

we announced a plan in may 2011 which we began implementing in fiscal 2011 and expect to complete in fiscal 2012 to realign our sales services and engineering organizations in order to simplify our operating model and focus on our five foundational priorities 

 

  

  

  

  

 we believe that focusing on these priorities will best position us to continue to expand our share of our customers’ information technology spending 

we are currently undergoing product transitions in our core business and introducing nextgeneration products with higher price performance and architectural advantages compared to both our prior generation of products and the product offerings of our competitors we believe that many of these product transitions are gaining momentum based on the strong yearoveryear product revenue growth across these nextgeneration product families we believe that our strategy and our ability to innovate and execute may enable us to improve our relative competitive position in many of our product areas even in uncertain or difficult business conditions and therefore may continue to provide us with longterm growth opportunities however we believe that these newly introduced products may continue to negatively impact product gross margins which we are currently striving to address through various initiatives including value engineering effective supply chain management and delivering greater customer value through offers that include hardware software and services 

we continue to seek to capitalize on market transitions market transitions on which we are primarily focused include those related to the increased role of virtualizationthe cloud video collaboration networked mobility technologies and the transition from internet protocol version 4 to internet protocol version 6 for example a market in which a significant market transition is under way is the enterprise data center market where a transition to virtualizationthe cloud is rapidly evolving there is a continued growing awareness that intelligent networks are becoming the platform for productivity improvement and global competitiveness we believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market is accelerating due to changing technology trends such as the increasing adoption of virtualization the rise in scalable processing and the advent of cloud computing and cloudbased it resource deployments and business models these key terms are defined as follows 

virtualization refers to the process of aggregating the current siloed data center resources into unified shared resource pools that can be dynamically delivered to applications on demand thus enabling the ability to move content and applications between devices and the network 

the cloud refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which resources such as servers or software applications are no longer tethered to a user’s physical infrastructure but instead are delivered to and consumed by the user “on demand” as an internetbased service whether singularly or with multiple other users simultaneously 

this virtualization and clouddriven market transition in the enterprise data center market is being brought about through the convergence of networking computing storage and software technologies we are seeking to take advantage of this market transition through among other things our cisco unified computing system platform and cisco nexus product families which are designed to integrate the previously siloed technologies in the enterprise data center with a unified architecture we are also seeking to capitalize on this market transition through the development of other cloudbased product and service offerings through which we intend to enable customers to develop and deploy their own cloudbased it solutions including softwareasaservice saas and otherasaservice xaas solutions 

  

the competitive landscape in the enterprise data center market is changing very large wellfinanced and aggressive competitors are each bringing their own new class of products to address this new market we expect this competitive market trend to continue with respect to this market we believe the network will be the intersection of innovation through an open ecosystem and standards we expect to see acquisitions further industry consolidation and new alliances among companies as they seek to serve the enterprise data center market as we enter this next market phase we expect that we will strengthen certain strategic alliances compete more with certain strategic alliances and partners and perhaps also encounter new competitors in our attempt to deliver the best solutions for our customers 

other market transitions on which we are focusing particular attention include those related to the increased role of video collaboration and networked mobility technologies the key market transitions relative to the convergence of video collaboration and networked mobility technologies which we believe will drive productivity and growth in network loads appear to be evolving even more quickly and more significantly than we had previously anticipated cisco telepresence systems are one example of product offerings that have incorporated video collaboration and networked mobility technologies as customers evolve their communications and business models we are focused on simplifying and expanding the creation distribution and use of endtoend video solutions for businesses and consumers 

we believe that the architectural approach that has served us well in the past in addressing market opportunities in the communications and it industry will be adaptable to other markets an example of a market where we aim to apply this approach is mobility where growth of ip traffic on handheld devices is driving the need for more robust architectures equipment and services in order to accommodate not only an increasing number of worldwide mobile device users but also increased user demand for broadbandquality business network and consumer web applications to be delivered on such devices 

revenue 

for fiscal 2011 total revenue increased by 8 within total revenue net product revenue increased 6 and net service revenue increased 14 each as compared with fiscal 2010 with regard to our geographic segment performance net revenue increased 6 in the united states and canada segment 6 in our european markets segment 14 in our emerging markets segment and 12 in our asia pacific markets segment customer market product revenue performance in fiscal 2011 was driven by increases in order of largest percentage growth in our commercial service provider and enterprise markets our consumer market experienced a large revenue decline in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 as we exited the flip video cameras business and experienced weakness in sales of our networked home products 

the 6 increase in product revenue was driven by growth across most of our product categories in particular our new products category experienced a revenue increase of 14 primarily as a result of the acquisition of tandberg which was completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 within the new products category increased revenue was driven by growth of 44 in data center and revenue growth of 31 in collaboration in our core product categories we experienced revenue growth of 6 in routers principally as a result of strength in the highend router product offerings and flat revenue in our switches product category with singledigit revenue growth in fixedconfiguration switching products being offset by a similar revenue decline in modular switches the net service revenue increase was experienced across the technical support services and advanced services categories with revenue increases of 12 and 21 respectively in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 for further details see our discussion of fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 beginning on page 50 

gross margin 

in fiscal 2011 our gross margin percentage decreased by approximately 26 percentage points as compared with fiscal 2010 within this total gross margin change product gross margin declined by 37 percentage points while service gross margin increased by 15 percentage points the decrease in our product gross margin percentage was a result of higher sales discounts and unfavorable product pricing unfavorable product mix and 

  

restructuring and other charges additionally increased amortization expense and impairment charges from purchased intangible assets contributed to the decline in product gross margin partially offsetting these decreases were lower overall manufacturing costs and higher shipment volume the increase in our service gross margin was due to increased volume partially offset by increased costs and unfavorable mix impacts for further details see our discussion of fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 beginning on page 50 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 increased by 14 in fiscal 2011 research and development expenses increased 10 sales and marketing expenses increased 12 while general and administrative expenses were down slightly the collective increase was primarily a result of higher headcountrelated expenses this increase was partially offset by the impact from the fiscal 2011 period containing one less week compared with the fiscal 2010 period operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased by 24 percentage points primarily as a result of restructuring and other charges and the higher headcountrelated charges along with increased expense from purchased intangible asset amortization and impairments 

other key financial measures 

the following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2011 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes note 2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates such accounting policies require significant judgments assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 

  

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria have been met 

 

  

  

  

 in instances where final acceptance of the product system or solution is specified by the customer revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met when a sale involves multiple deliverables such as sales of products that include services the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each unit of accounting are met 

the amount of product and service revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple deliverables and if so our valuation of the units of accounting for multiple deliverables according to the accounting guidance prescribed in accounting standards codification asc 605 revenue recognition  we use vendorspecific objective evidence of selling price vsoe for each of those units when available we determine vsoe based on our normal pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range generally evidenced by approximately 80 of such historical standalone transactions falling within plus or minus 15 of the median selling price vsoe exists across most of our product and service offerings in certain limited circumstances when vsoe does not exist we apply the selling price hierarchy to applicable multipledeliverable arrangements under the selling price hierarchy thirdparty evidence of selling price tpe will be considered if vsoe does not exist and estimated selling price esp will be used if neither vsoe nor tpe is available generally we are not able to determine tpe because our gotomarket strategy differs from that of others in our markets and the extent of customization varies among comparable products or services from our peers in determining esp we apply significant judgment as we weigh a variety of factors based on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement we typically arrive at an esp for a product or service that is not sold separately by considering companyspecific factors such as geographies competitive landscape internal costs gross margin objectives pricing practices used to establish bundled pricing and existing portfolio pricing and discounting 

some of our sales arrangements have multiple deliverables containing software and related software support components such sale arrangements are subject to the accounting guidance in asc 985605 softwarerevenue recognition  

as our business and offerings evolve over time our pricing practices may be required to be modified accordingly which could result in changes in selling prices including both vsoe and esp in subsequent periods there were no material impacts during fiscal 2011 nor do we currently expect a material impact in fiscal 2012 on our revenue recognition due to any changes in our vsoe tpe or esp 

revenue deferrals relate to the timing of revenue recognition for specific transactions based on financing arrangements service support and other factors financing arrangements may include salestype directfinancing and operating leases loans and guarantees of thirdparty financing our deferred revenue for products was 37 billion as of both july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 technical support services revenue is deferred and 

  

recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed which typically is from one to three years advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance our deferred revenue for services was 85 billion and 74 billion as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 respectively 

we make sales to distributors and retail partners and generally recognize revenue based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these programs if actual credits received by our distributors and retail partners under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected 

allowances for receivables and sales returns 

the allowances for receivables were as follows in millions except percentages 

 

 the allowances are based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts we regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience credit quality and age of the receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay historical default rates and longterm historical loss rates published by major thirdparty creditrating agencies we also consider the concentration of receivables outstanding with a particular customer in assessing the adequacy of our allowances in addition we evaluate the credit quality of our financing receivables and any associated allowance for credit loss by applying the relevant loss factors based on our internal credit risk rating for the respective financing receivables disaggregated by segment and class see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements determination of loss factors associated with internal credit risk ratings is complex and subjective our ongoing consideration of all these factors could result in an increase in our allowance for credit loss in the future which could adversely affect our net income similarly if a major customer’s creditworthiness deteriorates if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience or if other circumstances arise our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated and additional allowances could be required which could have an adverse impact on our revenue 

both accounts receivable and financing receivables are charged off at the point when they are considered uncollectible the decline in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable was primarily due to the chargeoff of certain uncollectible receivables that had been fully reserved 

a reserve for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates the reserve for future sales returns as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 was 106 million and 90 million respectively and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established our revenue could be adversely affected 

inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 

our inventory balance was 15 billion and 13 billion as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 respectively inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a 

  

component of our cost of sales at the point of the loss recognition a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 

we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory as of july 30 2011 the liability for these purchase commitments was 168 million compared with 135 million as of july 31 2010 and was included in other current liabilities 

our provision for inventory was 196 million 94 million and 93 million for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was 114 million 8 million and 87 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in the provision for inventory and the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was due in part to charges recorded in connection with the restructuring and realignment of our consumer business additionally the provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased due to higher provisions related to certain component supplies that we secured for our extended needs and due to higher contract manufacturer excess and obsolescence charges if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we could be required to increase our inventory writedowns and our liability for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers and accordingly gross margin could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitments inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence particularly in light of current macroeconomic uncertainties and conditions and the resulting potential for changes in future demand forecast 

warranty costs 

the liability for product warranties included in other current liabilities was 342 million as of july 30 2011 compared with 360 million as of july 31 2010 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material costs technical support labor costs and associated overhead material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the rate of customer cases and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period overhead cost is applied based on estimated time to support warranty activities 

the provision for product warranties issued during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 was 456 million 469 million and 374 million respectively if we experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience or if the cost of servicing warranty claims is greater than expected our gross margin could be adversely affected 

sharebased compensation expense 

sharebased compensation expense is presented as follows in millions 

 

 prior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on march 17 2011 the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units was measured based on an expected dividend yield of 0 as we did not historically pay 

  

cash dividends on our common stock for awards granted on or subsequent to march 17 2011 we used an annualized dividend yield based on the per share dividends declared by our board of directors see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

the determination of the fair value of employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights on the date of grant using an optionpricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables for employee stock options and employee stock purchase rights these variables include but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards the riskfree interest rate and expected dividends as of the grant date for employee stock options we used the implied volatility for twoyear traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the latticebinomial model for employee stock purchase rights we used the implied volatility for traded options with lives corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights on our stock the selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility the valuation of employee stock options is also impacted by kurtosis and skewness which are technical measures of the distribution of stock price returns and the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 

because sharebased compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest it has been reduced for forfeitures if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of our optionpricing model in future periods or if we experience different forfeiture rates the compensation expense that is derived may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current year 

fair value measurements 

our fixed income and publicly traded equity securities collectively are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at a fair value of 369 billion as of july 30 2011 compared with 353 billion as of july 31 2010 our fixed income investment portfolio as of july 30 2011 consisted primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

as described more fully in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements a valuation hierarchy is based on the level of independent objective evidence available regarding the value of the investments it encompasses three classes of investments level 1 consists of securities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical securities level 2 consists of securities for which observable inputs other than level 1 inputs are used such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets or quoted prices for identical securities in less active markets and modelderived valuations for which the variables are derived from or corroborated by observable market data and level 3 consists of securities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value 

our level 2 securities are valued using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data we use inputs such as actual trade data benchmark yields brokerdealer quotes and other similar data which are obtained from independent pricing vendors quoted market prices or other sources to determine the ultimate fair value of our assets and liabilities we use such pricing data as the primary input to which we have not made any material adjustments during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 to make our assessments and determinations as to the ultimate valuation of our investment portfolio we are ultimately responsible for the financial statements and underlying estimates 

the inputs and fair value are reviewed for reasonableness may be further validated by comparison to publicly available information and could be adjusted based on market indices or other information that management deems material to its estimate of fair value the assessment of fair value can be difficult and subjective however given the relative reliability of the inputs we use to value our investment portfolio and because substantially all of our valuation inputs are obtained using quoted market prices for similar or identical assets we do not believe that the nature of estimates and assumptions affected by levels of subjectivity and judgment was 

  

material to the valuation of the investment portfolio as of july 30 2011 level 3 assets do not represent a significant portion of our total investment portfolio as of july 30 2011 

otherthantemporary impairments we recognize an impairment charge when the declines in the fair values of our fixed income or publicly traded equity securities below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary the ultimate value realized on these securities to the extent unhedged is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 

if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost we assess whether the impairment is other than temporary an impairment is considered other than temporary if i we have the intent to sell the security ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its entire amortized cost basis or iii we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on i or ii described in the prior sentence the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the security is recognized in earnings if an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition iii the amount representing credit loss defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security will be recognized in earnings and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income oci in estimating the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected we consider all available information including past events current conditions the remaining payment terms of the security the financial condition of the issuer expected defaults and the value of underlying collateral 

for publicly traded equity securities we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 

there were no significant impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2011 and 2010 there were no impairment charges on investments in fixed income securities in fiscal 2011 and 2010 in fiscal 2009 impairment charges of 258 million for investments in fixed income securities and publicly traded equity securities were recognized in earnings our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

we also have investments in privately held companies some of which are in the startup or development stages as of july 30 2011 our investments in privately held companies were 796 million compared with 756 million as of july 31 2010 and were included in other assets see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements we monitor these investments for events or circumstances indicative of potential impairment and will make appropriate reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and nearterm prospects of these companies these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 10 million 25 million and 85 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairments 

our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit effective in fiscal 2010 the assessment 

  

of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets 

the goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 was 168 billion and 167 billion respectively in response to changes in industry and market conditions we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses which could result in an impairment of goodwill as a result of the pending divestiture of our manufacturing operations in juarez mexico we recorded an adjustment of 63 million to reduce goodwill associated with these operations there was no impairment of goodwill resulting from our annual impairment testing in fiscal 2011 2010 or 2009 the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units ranged from approximately 7 billion for the asia pacific markets segment to approximately 12 billion for the united states and canada segment as of july 30 2011 we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit as of july 30 2011 would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate we review indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by a variety of factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts our impairment charges related to purchased intangible assets were 164 million 28 million and 95 million during fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in additional impairment charges in the future which could adversely affect our net income 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes foreign operations research and development rd tax credits tax audit settlements nondeductible compensation international realignments and transfer pricing adjustments our effective tax rate was 171 175 and 203 in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes although we believe our reserves are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest 

significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in the event 

  

that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd costsharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

loss contingencies 

we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

discussion of fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 

fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were 52 53 and 52week fiscal years respectively 

net sales 

the following table presents the breakdown of net sales between product and service revenue in millions except percentages 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net sales increased by 8 within total net sales growth net product sales increased by 6 while service revenue increased by 14 our product and service revenue totals each reflected sales growth across each of our geographic segments the sales increase was due to customer acceptance of the new product transitions taking place in our core business sales growth in our new products category and the strong performance of our services solutions 

we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

in addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors including a reduced it spending environment and budgetdriven reductions in spending by government entities net sales by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition including the complexity of transactions 

  

such as multipleelement arrangements the mix of financing arrangements provided to our channel partners and customers and final acceptance of the product system or solution among other factors in addition certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the net sales related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition which in turn would impact the net sales of the relevant segment as has been the case in our emerging markets segment from time to time customers require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support and this may occur in future periods which may also impact the timing of the recognition of revenue 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

net sales increased across all of our geographic segments in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 in our view the sales increase in fiscal 2010 was a result of the global demand recovery during fiscal 2010 in comparison to the weakness we experienced for most of fiscal 2009 we had an increase in both net product sales and service revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 from a customer market perspective in fiscal 2010 we saw an improved demand environment for capital expenditures and balanced growth across all of our customer markets 

net product sales by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of net product sales by segment in millions except percentages 

 

 united states and canada 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net product sales in the united states and canada segment increased by 5 net product sales increased 3 in the united states and increased 31 in canada the increase in net product sales was across most of our customer markets in the united states and canada segment led by the net product sales growth in our commercial market followed by smaller increases in net product sales growth in both the service provider and enterprise markets net product sales in the consumer market declined during fiscal 2011 as we exited the flip video cameras business and experienced weakness in sales of our networked home products within the enterprise market net product sales to the us public sector decreased due to a decrease in sales to the us federal government while sales to the state and local government submarket were flat the challenges experienced in fiscal 2011 within the public sector submarket of our enterprise market may continue into fiscal 2012 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

net product sales in the united states and canada segment increased during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due to the improvement in the economic environment in this segment the increase in net product sales 

  

compared with fiscal 2009 was across all of our customer markets in the united states and canada segment led by the commercial and enterprise markets within the enterprise market net product sales to the us federal government increased as compared with fiscal 2009 our net product sales in the consumer market for fiscal 2010 increased compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to sales of flip video cameras from the acquisition of pure digital which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 from a product perspective the increase in fiscal 2010 net product sales in this segment was driven in large part by higher sales of our switching products 

european markets 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net product sales in the european markets segment increased by 6 the increase in net product sales in the european markets segment was due to growth in the service provider and enterprise markets sales to the commercial market were flat while sales in the consumer market declined for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 from a country perspective for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net product sales increased by approximately 17 in france 13 in the netherlands 2 in germany 1 in the united kingdom and were flat in italy 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

the slight increase in net product sales in the european markets segment in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was driven by increased sales across most of our customer markets in this segment with particular strength in the enterprise and commercial markets from a country perspective net product sales increased in the united kingdom and france while decreasing for both germany and italy compared with fiscal 2009 our european markets segment grew more slowly relative to other segments on a yearoveryear basis which we believe was attributable in part to the fact that many of the countries in this segment were among the last countries to begin experiencing the economic downturn in fiscal 2009 and consequently some of these countries are recovering later product sales growth in this segment began to strengthen in the second half of fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2010 we did not see significant negative effects on our net product sales in the european markets segment from the economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain european countries 

emerging markets 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net product sales in the emerging markets segment increased by 12 the net product sales increase was led by a sales increase in the commercial market followed by sales increases in the service provider and enterprise markets net product sales in the consumer market declined for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 from a country perspective net product sales increased by approximately 63 in russia 20 in brazil and 8 in mexico 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

net product sales in the emerging markets segment increased primarily as a result of increased product sales across all of our customer markets with the exception of the consumer market we experienced a return to stronger yearoveryear sales growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 led by brazil mexico and russia 

asia pacific markets 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 net product sales in our asia pacific markets segment increased by 10 the increase was led by sales growth in the commercial and enterprise markets and to a lesser extent sales growth in the service provider market net product sales in the consumer market declined for fiscal 2011 as 

  

compared with fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2011 we experienced weakness within our public sector market in our asia pacific markets segment we may continue to experience challenging conditions in the public sector market in fiscal 2012 from a country perspective net product sales increased by approximately 13 in india 11 in china 8 in australia and 7 in japan 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

the increase in net product sales in the asia pacific markets segment in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was attributable to increased product sales to our enterprise commercial and service provider markets in this segment in fiscal 2010 we experienced strength in most countries including china australia and japan each of which is among the largest countries in this segment 

net product sales by groups of similar products 

in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis we also prepare financial information related to groups of similar products and customer markets for various purposes effective as of the first quarter of fiscal 2011 we have regrouped our presentation of products and technologies formerly grouped as either advanced technologies or other into two new categories called new products and other products the new products category includes some products that had previously been grouped in the category called advanced technology products and also includes some products that had previously been in the category called other the new products category consists of the following subcategories video connected home networked home pure digital products video systems and cable products collaboration unified communications and cisco telepresence security wireless and data center application networking services storage and cisco unified computing system products the other products category consists primarily of optical networking products and emerging technology products 

the following table presents net sales for groups of similar products in millions except percentages 

 

 routers 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

we categorize our routers primarily as highend midrange and lowend routers for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 growth in sales of our routers product category was driven by an 8 or 334 million increase in sales of our highend routers within highend router products the increase was driven by higher sales of cisco aggregation services routers asr 5000 products from our december 2009 acquisition of starent and higher sales of the cisco asr 1000 and cisco asr 9000 products these increases were partially offset by lower sales of cisco 12000 series routers and cisco 7600 series routers for fiscal 2011 midrange and lowend routers each increased sales by 2 or 16 million and 30 million respectively compared with fiscal 2010 small office routing experienced a small revenue decline 

  

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

our sales of routers increased in our highend category in fiscal 2010 by 10 or 409 million while sales of routers declined in both the midrange and lowend categories by 11 and 5 respectively within the highend router category the increase was driven by higher sales of the cisco crs1 carrier routing system cisco 7600 series routers and cisco asr 1000 and 9000 products and the inclusion of the cisco asr 5000 products from our acquisition of starent partially offset by lower sales of cisco 12000 series routers our decline in sales of midrange and lowend routers was primarily due to a decline in sales of our integrated services routers 

switches 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

net product sales in our switches product category were relatively flat in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 which was due to the combined effect of continuing transitions taking place in our product portfolio lower public sector spending and the impact of increased competitive pressures since approximately 25 of our switching business is derived from sales to the public sector reductions in public sector spending in developed markets around the world could continue to present challenges for our switching sales performance within our switches product category higher sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches partially offset lower sales of modular switches sales of lan fixedconfiguration switches increased 3 or 240 million while sales of modular switches decreased 4 or 275 million the increase in lan fixedconfiguration switches was primarily due to increased sales of cisco catalyst 2960 series switches and cisco nexus 2000 and 5000 series switches partially offset by decreased sales of cisco catalyst 3560 and 3750 series switches the decrease in sales of modular switches was primarily due to decreased sales of cisco catalyst 6500 series switches partially offset by increased sales of cisco nexus 7000 and cisco catalyst 4500 series switches 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

the increase in net product sales related to switches in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was due primarily to higher sales of our modular and lan fixedconfiguration switches of approximately 882 million and 649 million respectively the increase in sales of modular switches was primarily due to the increased sales of our cisco nexus 7000 and cisco catalyst 4500 series switches partially offset by decreased sales of our cisco catalyst 6000 series switches the increase in lan fixedconfiguration switches was primarily due to increased sales of cisco catalyst 2960 series switches and cisco nexus 5000 and 2000 series switches partially offset by decreased sales of our cisco catalyst 3560 series switches

 other products 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the increase in other product revenue during fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a 19 increase in sales of optical networking products and a 17 increase in emerging technology products 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

the increase in other products revenue in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a 99 increase in sales of emerging technology products partially offset by a 1 decline in sales of optical networking products 

  

net service sales by segment 

the following table presents the breakdown of service revenue by segment in millions except percentages 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

net service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments with emerging markets and asia pacific markets reporting strong revenue growth technical support services revenue increased 12 and advanced services which relates to consulting support services for specific network needs experienced 21 revenue growth technical support service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments with particular strength in emerging markets and asia pacific markets growth in each of our united states and canada and our european markets segments also contributed to the overall technical support service revenue growth renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with recent product sales have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced which was the primary driver for these increases we experienced revenue growth in advanced services across each of our geographic segments with strong growth in our asia pacific markets european markets and emerging markets segments followed by slower growth in our united states and canada segment total service revenue growth also benefited from a full year of service revenue attributable to our acquisitions of tandberg and starent during fiscal 2010 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

net service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments in fiscal 2010 with particular strength in our asia pacific markets the increase in total service revenue was due to growth from technical support services as well as increased revenue from advanced services technical support service revenue increased across all of our geographic segments with solid growth in our asia pacific markets and european markets segments in fiscal 2010 we experienced advanced services revenue growth across each of our geographic segments except for our emerging markets segment total service revenue growth in fiscal 2010 also benefited from incremental revenue from our acquisitions during fiscal 2010 of tandberg and starent renewals and technical support service contract initiations associated with product sales during fiscal 2010 have resulted in a new installed base of equipment being serviced contributing to these increases 

  

gross margin 

the following table presents the gross margin for products and services in millions except percentages 

 

 product gross margin 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 

 

 in fiscal 2011 product gross margin decreased by 37 percentage points the decrease was primarily due to the impact of higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable product pricing which were driven by normal market factors and by the geographic mix of product revenue these factors impacted most of our customer markets and all of our geographic segments additionally our product gross margin was negatively impacted by the shift in the mix of products sold as a result of revenue declines in our higher margin switching products coupled with revenue increases from our lower margin cisco unified computing system products higher yearoveryear impairment charges related to acquisitionrelated intangible assets and higher restructuring and other charges both primarily in the consumer business also contributed to the decline in our product gross margin percentage these negative factors were partially offset by lower overall manufacturing costs and by slightly higher shipment volume the lower overall manufacturing costs were in part due to favorable component pricing continued operational efficiency in manufacturing operations and value engineering value engineering is the process by which production costs are reduced through component redesign board configuration test processes and transformation processes 

our future gross margins could be impacted by our product mix and by further growth in sales of products that have lower gross margins such as cisco unified computing system products our gross margins may also be impacted by the geographic mix of our revenue or as was the case in fiscal 2011 and 2010 by increased sales discounts rebates and product pricing which may be attributable to competitive factors additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain if any of the preceding factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods our product and service gross margins could continue to decline 

  

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

the following table summarizes the key factors that contributed to the change in product gross margin percentage from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2010 

 

 product gross margin for fiscal 2010 increased by 02 percentage points compared with fiscal 2009 due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs driven by strong operational efficiency in manufacturing operations value engineering and a reduction in other manufacturingrelated costs the product gross margin for fiscal 2010 also benefited from the increase in shipment volume a favorable product mix contributed slightly to the increase in product gross margin percentage fiscal 2010 product gross margin was negatively impacted by sales discounts rebates and product pricing which were driven by normal market factors as well as the geographic mix of product revenue the impact from sales discounts rebates and product pricing was within our expected range 

service gross margin 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

our service gross margin percentage increased by 15 percentage points for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 with both technical support services and advanced services experiencing higher gross margins the increase was primarily due to higher sales volume partially offsetting the volume increases were unfavorable mix impacts primarily due to advanced services representing a higher proportion of service revenue in fiscal 2011 and due to increased service delivery costs gross margin in technical support services increased primarily as a result of increased sales volume and lower headcountrelated cost impacts these benefits were partially offset by increased support service delivery costs particularly from outside services advanced services gross margin increased primarily due to strong volume growth partially offset by higher delivery team costs which were partially headcount related our revenue from advanced services may increase to a higher proportion of total service revenue due to our continued focus on providing comprehensive support to our customers’ networking devices applications and infrastructures 

our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support the overall service business other factors include the mix of service offerings as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

our service gross margin percentage was unchanged from fiscal 2009 due to higher margins for technical support services offset by a decline in the gross margin for advanced services the increase in technical support service gross margin in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was primarily a result of increased volume technical support margins will experience some variability due to various factors such as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals as well as the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business the decrease in advanced services gross margin in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was primarily due to increased headcount costs partially offset by higher volume 

  

gross margin by segment 

the following table presents the total gross margin for each segment in millions except percentages 

 

  

 fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 the gross margin percentage across all geographic segments declined primarily due to higher sales discounts rebates and unfavorable pricing as well as due to a product mix shift these declines were partially offset by the impacts from increased shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs across all geographic segments the gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate and periodtoperiod changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment our product and service gross margins may be impacted by economic downturns or uncertain economic conditions as well as our movement into new market opportunities and could decline if any of the factors that impact our gross margins are adversely affected in future periods 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2010 the gross margin percentage in the united states and canada segment declined compared with fiscal 2009 primarily due to higher sales discounts and a lower service gross margin the decline was partially offset by the impacts from increased shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs the gross margin percentage in the european markets segment increased during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs increased shipment volume and favorable product mix the increase in this segment was partially offset by the impact of higher sales discounts in fiscal 2010 the gross margin percentage in the emerging markets segment increased compared with fiscal 2009 due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs partially offset by the impact of higher sales discounts the gross margin percentage in the asia pacific markets segment increased during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due primarily to higher shipment volume and lower overall manufacturing costs gross margin in the asia pacific markets segment also benefited from favorable mix shifts in japan partially offsetting this increase was the impact of higher sales discounts for each of our segments the negative impact of sales discounts rebates and product pricing was driven by normal market factors and was within our expected range 

factors that may impact net sales and gross margin 

net product sales may continue to be affected by factors including global economic downturns and related market uncertainty that have resulted in reduced or cautious spending in our global enterprise service provider and commercial markets changes in the geopolitical environment and global economic conditions competition 

  

including pricefocused competitors from asia especially from china new product introductions sales cycles and product implementation cycles changes in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise markets changes in the mix of direct sales and indirect sales variations in sales channels and final acceptance criteria of the product system or solution as specified by the customer sales to the service provider market have been and may be in the future characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain products within our new products category in addition service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including network design services and often have acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition certain of our customers in the emerging markets segment also tend to make large and sporadic purchases and the net sales related to these transactions may similarly be affected by the timing of revenue recognition as we focus on new market opportunities customers may require greater levels of financing arrangements service and support especially in the emerging markets segment which in turn may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to focus on managing our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results 

net product sales may also be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for our products especially with respect to telecommunications service providers and internet businesses whether or not driven by any slowdown in capital expenditures in the service provider market price and product competition in the communications and information technology industry introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products adoption of new networking standards and financial difficulties experienced by our customers we may from time to time experience manufacturing issues that create a delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide specific components resulting in delayed shipments to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods when we and our suppliers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter for additional factors that may impact net product sales see “part i item 1a risk factors” 

our distributors and retail partners participate in various cooperative marketing and other programs increased sales to our distributors and retail partners generally result in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a certain degree the timing of orders from our customers we recognize revenue for sales to our distributors and retail partners generally based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 

product gross margin may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the mix of products sold including periods of increased growth of some of our lower margin products introduction of new products including products with priceperformance advantages our ability to reduce production costs entry into new markets including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures as a result of internal development or through acquisitions changes in distribution channels price competition including competitors from asia especially those from china changes in geographic mix of our product sales the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals sales discounts increases in material or labor costs including sharebased compensation expense excess inventory and obsolescence charges warranty costs changes in shipment volume loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing effects of value engineering inventory holding charges and the extent to which we successfully execute on our strategy and operating plans additionally our manufacturingrelated costs may be negatively impacted by constraints in our supply chain service gross margin may be impacted by various factors such as the change in mix between technical support services and advanced services the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals sharebased compensation expense and the timing of our strategic investments in headcount and resources to support this business 

  

research and development rd sales and marketing and general and administrative ga expenses 

rd sales and marketing and ga expenses are summarized in the following table in millions except percentages 

 

 fiscal 2010 had an extra week compared with fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2009 we estimate that the extra week contributed approximately 150 million of additional research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expense in fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2012 we plan to reduce our annualized expense run rate by approximately 1 billion the yearoveryear changes within operating expenses including the effects of foreign currency exchange rates net of hedging are summarized by line item as follows 

rd expenses 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the increase in rd expenses for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher headcountrelated expenses higher contracted services and increased depreciation and equipment expenditures the increase in depreciation expense was partially acquisition related we continue to invest in rd in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion if we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products we may purchase or license technology from other businesses or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal rd 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

the slight increase in rd expenses for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to higher headcountrelated expenses including increased variable compensation expense and the impact of acquisitions higher sharebased compensation expense and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010 partially offsetting the increase in rd expenses in fiscal 2010 were lower acquisitionrelated compensation expenses associated with milestone achievements from prior period acquisitions and the absence in fiscal 2010 of the enhanced early retirement and limited workforce reduction charges incurred during fiscal 2009 

sales and marketing expenses 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

sales and marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased compared with fiscal 2010 due to an increase of 851 million in sales expenses and an increase of 179 million in marketing expenses both the sales expense and the marketing expense components of the category increased for fiscal 2011 due to higher headcountrelated expenses as well as higher outside services costs higher depreciation expense and increased sharebased compensation expense additionally marketing expenses for fiscal 2011 increased due to higher advertisement expenses 

  

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

sales and marketing expenses increased in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due to an increase of 222 million in sales expenses and an increase of 116 million in marketing expenses both the sales expense and the marketing expense components of the category increased during fiscal 2010 due to higher headcountrelated expenses including higher variable compensation expense higher sharebased compensation expense and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010 

ga expenses 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the decrease in ga expenses in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was due to lower real estaterelated charges in fiscal 2011 and the absence of nonincome taxrelated expenses such as fees and licenses which were included in fiscal 2010 partially offsetting these items were higher headcountrelated expenses higher outside services costs for operational support areas and increased equipment depreciation and rent expenses 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

the increase in ga expenses in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was in part attributable to approximately 130 million of higher real estaterelated charges related to impairments and other charges related to excess facilities additionally ga expenses in fiscal 2010 increased due to higher sharebased compensation expense higher headcountrelated expenses acquisitionrelated expenses and higher information technology expenses as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010 

effect of foreign currency 

in fiscal 2011 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 53 million or approximately 03 compared with fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2010 foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased the combined rd sales and marketing and ga expenses by 34 million or approximately 02 compared with fiscal 2009 

headcount 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 our headcount increased by 1111 employees the increase being attributable to targeted hiring as part of our investment in growth initiatives partially offset by the impacts of our voluntary early retirement program and our restructuring activities which began to reduce our headcount in late fiscal 2011 we expect our headcount to decrease in the near term as part of targeted costcutting initiatives which include the workforce reduction announced in july 2011 additionally we also expect our headcount in fiscal 2012 to decrease by approximately 5000 employees upon the planned completion in fiscal 2012 of the sale of our juarez mexico manufacturing operations 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 our headcount increased by approximately 5150 employees which was attributable to the acquisitions of tandberg and starent along with targeted hiring as part of our investment in growth initiatives 

  

sharebased compensation expense 

the following table presents sharebased compensation expense in millions 

 

 the increase in sharebased compensation expense for fiscal 2011 was due primarily to a change in vesting periods from five to four years for awards granted beginning in fiscal 2009 the timing of annual employee grants and the overall growth in headcount and number of sharebased awards granted on a yearoveryear basis sharebased compensation expense increased for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 due primarily to the effects of straightline vesting compared with accelerated vesting for options granted prior to fiscal 2006 a change in vesting periods from five to four years for awards granted beginning in fiscal 2009 and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

amortization of purchased intangible assets 

the following table presents the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses in millions 

 

 for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 the increase in the amortization of purchased intangible assets was due to impairment charges included in operating expenses of 92 million in fiscal 2011 partially offset by lower amortization due to certain purchased intangible assets having become fully amortized the impairment charges were primarily due to declines in estimated fair value as a result of reductions in expected future cash flows associated with certain of our consumer products for fiscal 2010 the decrease in the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses was primarily due to lower impairment charges in fiscal 2010 as compared with fiscal 2009 partially offset by increased amortization of purchased intangible assets from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2010 for additional information regarding purchased intangible assets see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

the fair value of acquired technology and patents as well as acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discounts expected future cash flows to present value the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weightedaverage cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate we consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the hightechnology communications industry and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets 

  

restructuring and other charges 

in fiscal 2011 we incurred within operating expenses restructuring charges of 799 million these charges included 453 million related to a voluntary early retirement program for eligible employees in the united states and canada 247 million related to employee severance for other employees subject to our reduction of our work force and 71 million related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets primarily as a result of the pending sale of our juarez mexico manufacturing operations we also recorded charges within operating expenses of 28 million related to the consolidation of excess facilities and other activities we announced in july 2011 that we expected to take up to 13 billion in pretax charges as part of our expense reduction actions we incurred charges of 728 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 included as part of the 799 million discussed above related to these announcements we expect the remaining charges to be incurred during fiscal 2012 

interest and other income net 

interest income expense net the following table summarizes interest income and interest expense in millions 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

interest income increased slightly in fiscal 2011 due to increased income from financing receivables offsetting the effect of lower average interest rates on our portfolio of cash cash equivalents and fixed income investments the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was due to higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 attributable to our senior debt issuance in march 2011 partially offsetting the impact of higher average debt balances during fiscal 2011 is the effect of lower average interest rates on our debt during fiscal 2011 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

the decrease in interest income in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was due to lower average interest rates partially offset by higher average total cash and cash equivalents and fixed income security balances in fiscal 

2010 the increase in interest expense in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to additional interest expense related to our senior debt issuances in november 2009 and february 2009 

other income loss net the components of other income loss net are summarized as follows in millions 

 

   

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the increase in total net gains on availableforsale investments in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher gains on publicly traded equity securities partially offset by lower gains on fixed income securities in fiscal 2011 these changes were the result of market conditions and the timing of sales of these securities see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for the unrealized gains and losses on investments 

for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 the decline in net gains on investments in privately held companies was due to lower net equity method gains and lower gains on sales the decline was partially offset by lower impairment charges on investments in privately held companies impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 10 million and 25 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the change in other gains and losses net for fiscal 2011 as compared with fiscal 2010 was primarily due to fiscal 2011 experiencing lower gains from customer lease terminations higher donations expense and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 the increase in net gains on availableforsale investments was due to the absence of impairment charges on these securities during fiscal 2010 for fiscal 2009 the net gains and losses on fixed income securities included impairment charges of 219 million and net gains on publicly traded equity securities included impairment charges of 39 million 

the change in net gains losses on investments in privately held companies in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 was primarily due to higher realized gains and lower impairment charges in fiscal 2010 net losses on investments in privately held companies included impairment charges of 25 million in fiscal 2010 compared with 85 million in fiscal 2009 

other gains losses net for fiscal 2010 increased due primarily to gains resulting from customer operating lease terminations 

provision for income taxes 

fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 171 for fiscal 2011 compared with 175 for fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2010 the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit the “ninth circuit” withdrew its prior holding and reaffirmed the 2005 us tax court ruling in xilinx inc v commissioner  the net 04 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was attributable to the absence in fiscal 2011 of this tax benefit of 158 million or 17 percentage points offset by other items including the tax benefit of 188 million or 25 percentage points related to the retroactive reinstatement of the us federal rd credit 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with the repatriation of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes 

  

for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of 35 and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 

the provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 175 for fiscal 2010 compared with an effective tax rate of 203 for fiscal 2009 as discussed above during fiscal 2010 the ninth circuit withdrew its prior holding and reaffirmed the 2005 us tax court ruling in xilinx inc v commissioner  this final decision effectively reversed the corresponding tax charge in fiscal 2009 the net 28 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate between fiscal years was primarily attributable to this benefit and the absence in fiscal 2010 of the corresponding charge from fiscal 2009 partially offset by the absence in fiscal 2010 of the fiscal 2009 tax benefit of 106 million or 14 percentage points related to the retroactive portion of the us federal rd credit reinstatement 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet contractual obligations other commitments and the stock repurchase program on our liquidity and capital resources 

balance sheet and cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and investments in millions 

 

 the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments was primarily the result of cash provided by operations of 101 billion a slight decrease from 102 billion in fiscal 2010 and debt issuances of 15 billion net of repayments these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of common stock net of the issuance of common stock related to employee stock incentive plans of 51 billion capital expenditures of 12 billion and cash dividends paid of 07 billion 

the slight decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was primarily the result of a decrease in net income and the unfavorable impact to cash provided by operating activities from increased financing receivables partially offset by the favorable impact to cash provided by operating activities from lower accounts receivable 

our total in cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries was 398 billion and 332 billion as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 respectively the remaining balance held in the united states as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 was 48 billion and 67 billion respectively under current tax laws and regulations if cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside the united states were to be distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities we classify our investments as shortterm investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong with our cash equivalents and our fixed income investment 

  

portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investmentgrade securities we believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies for acquisitions for customer financing activities for working capital needs and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and dividends 

we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors including fluctuations in our operating results the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter which we refer to as shipment linearity the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables inventory and supply chain management deferred revenue excess tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation and the timing and amount of tax and other payments for additional discussion see “part i item 1a risk factors” in this report 

accounts receivable net the following table summarizes our accounts receivable net in millions and dso 

 

 our accounts receivable net as of july 30 2011 declined by approximately 5 compared with the end of fiscal 2010 our dso as of july 30 2011 was lower by 3 days compared with the end of fiscal 2010 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 our cash collections were strong and both product and services billings linearity improved particularly with respect to the timing of product shipments 

services billings have traditionally had the effect of increasing dso due in part to the timing of billings which in comparison to product billings have a larger proportion billed in the latter part of the quarter as services revenues have increased as a percentage of our total revenue this has contributed to a higher dso level in comparison to levels we experienced in past years we believe that the current dso level is in line with levels we expect in the near future 

inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers the following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers in millions except annualized inventory turns 

 

 inventories as of july 30 2011 increased by 12 from our balance at the end of fiscal 2010 while for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers were flat on a combined basis inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers increased by 3 from the balance at the end of fiscal 2010 we believe our inventory and purchase commitments are in line with our current demand forecasts 

the inventory increase was due to higher levels of distributor inventory and higher deferred cost of sales our inventories have decreased from the levels we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2011 in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we announced a restructuring of our consumer business and as a result we lowered inventory levels for our consumer products we also lowered inventory in certain parts of our cable settop business our finished goods consist of distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales and manufactured finished goods distributor inventory and deferred cost of sales are related to unrecognized revenue on shipments to distributors and retail partners as well as shipments to customers manufactured finished goods consist primarily of buildtoorder and 

  

buildtostock products all inventories are accounted for at the lower of cost or market inventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is a component of our cost of sales 

our ending balance for purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers reflects improvement and stabilization in lead times and the mitigation of many of the constraints at our component suppliers that we experienced in fiscal 2010 due to the earthquake in japan and resulting industrywide component supply constraints we made increased commitments to secure our nearterm supply needs offsetting these increases in purchase commitments were actions we have taken related to the restructuring of our consumer business while we may experience longer than normal lead times in the future our lead times to customers improved on nearly all of our products during fiscal 2011 and as of the end of fiscal 2011 were within a normal range for nearly all of our products 

we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed our purchase commitments are for shortterm product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity 

we record a liability included in other current liabilities for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory the purchase commitments for inventory are expected to be primarily fulfilled within one year 

inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels 

financing receivables and guarantees we measure our net balance sheet exposure position related to our financing receivables and financing guarantees by reducing the total of gross financing receivables and financing guarantees by the associated allowances for credit loss and deferred revenue as of july 30 2011 our net balance sheet exposure position related to financing receivables and financing guarantees was as follows in millions 

 

 financing receivables gross financing receivables less unearned income have increased by 33 compared with the end of fiscal 2010 driven by a 49 increase in gross financed service contracts a 30 increase in gross lease receivables and an 18 increase in gross loan receivables we provide financing to certain enduser customers 

  

and channel partners to enable sales of our products services and networking solutions these financing arrangements include leases financed service contracts and loans arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets lease receivables include salestype and directfinancing leases we also provide certain qualified customers financing for longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services we expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term 

financing guarantees in the normal course of business third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs the financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years in some cases we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements the financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving shortterm financing provided by third parties generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days in certain instances these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon transfer as these transfers qualify as true sales and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms these financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners and in some cases we guarantee a portion of these arrangements we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers historically our payments under these arrangements have been immaterial where we provide a guarantee we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and enduser financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees in either case the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed during fiscal 2011 the level of guarantees required by our financing partners decreased resulting in lower deferred revenue associated with our financing guarantees 

deferred revenue related to financing receivables and guarantees the majority of the deferred revenue in the preceding table is related to financed service contracts the revenue related to financed service contracts which primarily relates to technical support services is deferred and included in deferred service revenue the revenue related to financed service contracts is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed a portion of the revenue related to lease and loan receivables is also deferred and included in deferred product revenue based on revenue recognition criteria 

borrowings 

senior notes the following table summarizes the principal amount of our senior notes in millions 

 

   

interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixedrate notes each of which is redeemable by us at any time subject to a makewhole premium interest is payable quarterly on the floating rate notes we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of july 30 2011 in march 2011 we issued 125 billion of senior floating interest rate notes due 2014 20 billion of 1625 fixedrate senior notes due 2014 and 750 million of 315 fixedrate senior notes due 2017 for an aggregate principal amount of 40 billion to achieve our interest rate risk management objectives we entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of 275 billion designated as fair value hedges of the senior fixedrate notes included in the march 2011 debt issuance in effect these interest rate swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the fixedrate senior notes to floating interest rates based on libor the gains and losses related to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes attributable to market interest rates in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt 

in addition in february 2011 we repaid 30 billion of fixedrate senior notes upon their maturity 

commercial paper in the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we established a shortterm debt financing program of up to 30 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes as of july 30 2011 we had commercial paper notes of 500 million outstanding under this program 

other notes and borrowings other notes and borrowings include notes and credit facilities with a number of financial institutions that are available to certain of our foreign subsidiaries the amount of borrowings outstanding under these arrangements was 88 million and 59 million as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 respectively 

credit facility we have a credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a 30 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on august 17 2012 any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to based on certain conditions either i the higher of the federal funds rate plus 050 or bank of america’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time or ii libor plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by standard  poor’s ratings services and moody’s investors service inc the credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement 

we may also upon the agreement of either the thenexisting lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional 19 billion andor extend the expiration date of the credit facility up to august 15 2014 as of july 30 2011 we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility 

deferred revenue the following table presents the breakdown of deferred revenue in millions 

 

 the increase in deferred service revenue reflects the impact of new contract initiations and renewals partially offset by the ongoing amortization of deferred service revenue the increase in deferred product revenue was 

  

primarily related to an increase in shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria as of july 30 2011 partially offset by lower unrecognized revenue from twotier distributors due to the timing of cash receipts from twotier distributors 

contractual obligations 

the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously in addition we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at july 30 2011 in millions 

 

 operating leases we lease office space in several us locations outside the united states larger leased sites are located in australia belgium china germany india israel italy japan norway and the united kingdom we also lease equipment and vehicles operating lease amounts include future minimum lease payments under all our noncancelable operating leases with an initial term in excess of one year 

purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products a significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm noncancelable and unconditional commitments we record a liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory see further discussion in “inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers” as of july 30 2011 the liability for these purchase commitments was 168 million and is recorded in other current liabilities and is not included in the preceding table 

purchase obligations purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business other than commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for which we have not received the goods or services although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 

longterm debt the amount of longterm debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

other longterm liabilities other longterm liabilities include noncurrent income taxes payable accrued liabilities for deferred compensation noncurrent deferred tax liabilities and certain other longterm liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately 12 billion and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of 264 million were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements partially offset by payments 

  

other commitments 

in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of agreedupon technology development product or other milestones or continued employment with us of certain employees of acquired entities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

we also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our investments in privately held companies and venture funds some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreedupon milestones and some of which are required to be funded on demand the funding commitments were 192 million as of july 30 2011 compared with 279 million as of july 31 2010 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be offbalance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers these privately held companies and customers may be considered to be variable interest entities we evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and customer financings and we have determined that as of july 30 2011 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities 

in fiscal 2010 cisco and emc corporation “emc” together with vmware inc “vmware” formed the virtual computing environment coalition and invested in acadia enterprises llc “acadia” a joint venture with emc in which vmware and intel also invested during fiscal 2011 the virtual computing environment coalition and acadia were combined into a single entity and renamed the virtual computing environment company “vce” as of july 30 2011 our cumulative investment in the combined vce entity was approximately 100 million and we owned approximately 35 of the outstanding equity we account for our investment in vce under the equity method and accordingly our carrying value in vce has been reduced by 79 million which reflects our cumulative share of vce’s losses primarily in fiscal 2011 over the next 12 months as vce scales its operations we expect that we will make additional investments in vce and may incur additional losses in proportion to our ownership percentage 

on an ongoing basis we reassess our investments in privately held companies and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance as a result of this ongoing assessment we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities because we may not control these entities we may not have the ability to influence these events 

we provide financing guarantees which are generally for various thirdparty financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and enduser customers we could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or enduser customers see the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “financing receivables and guarantees” 

securities lending 

we periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our availableforsale investments these transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis the average balance of securities lending for fiscal 2011 and 2010 was 16 billion and 15 billion respectively we require collateral equal to at least 102 of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid highquality assets we engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against any collateral losses as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 we had no 

  

outstanding securities lending transactions we believe these arrangements do not present a material risk or impact to our liquidity requirements we did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented 

stock repurchase program and dividends 

in september 2001 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program as of july 30 2011 our board of directors had authorized an aggregate repurchase of up to 82 billion of common stock under this program and the remaining authorized repurchase amount was 102 billion with no termination date the stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program reported based on the trade date is summarized as follows in millions except pershare amounts 

 

 during fiscal 2011 cash dividends of 012 per share or 658 million were declared on our outstanding common stock and paid during the same period any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our board of directors 

liquidity and capital resource requirements 

based on past performance and current expectations we believe our cash and cash equivalents investments cash generated from operations and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy through at least the next 12 months our liquidity requirements both in total and domestically including the following working capital needs capital expenditures investment requirements stock repurchases cash dividends contractual obligations commitments principal and interest payments on debt future customer financings and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations there are no other transactions arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of as well as our requirements for capital resources

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks including interest rate risk equity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk 

interest rate risk 

fixed income securities 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities our primary objective for holding fixed income securities is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk at any time a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our fixed income investment portfolio conversely declines in interest rates including the impact from lower credit spreads could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio we may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives we had no outstanding hedging instruments for our fixed income securities as of july 30 2011 our fixed income investments are held for purposes other than trading our fixed income investments are not leveraged as of july 30 2011 see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we monitor our interest rate and credit risks including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers as of july 30 2011 approximately 75 of our fixed income securities balance consists of us government and us government agency securities we believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our fixed income securities including the hedging effects when applicable as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates the market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points “bps” plus 100 bps and plus 150 bps due to the low interest rate environment at the end of each of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 we did not believe a parallel shift of minus 100 bps or minus 150 bps was relevant the hypothetical fair values as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 are as follows in millions 

 

 there were no impairment charges on our investments in fixed income securities for fiscal 2011 or 2010 for fiscal 2009 we had impairment charges of 219 million on investments in fixed income securities 

debt 

as of july 30 2011 we had 160 billion in principal amount of senior notes outstanding which consisted of 125 billion floatingrate notes and 1475 billion fixedrate notes the carrying amount of the senior notes was 162 billion and the related fair value was 174 billion which fair value is based on market prices as of july 30 2011 a hypothetical 50 bps increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt excluding the 425 billion of hedged debt by a decrease or increase of 05 billion respectively however this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixedrate debt which is not hedged 

  

equity price risk 

the fair value of our equity investments in publicly traded companies is subject to market price volatility we may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio our equity portfolio consists of securities with characteristics that most closely match the standard  poor’s 500 index or nasdaq composite index these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain equity securities we may enter into equity derivatives designated as hedging instruments 

publicly traded equity securities 

the following tables present the hypothetical fair values of publicly traded equity securities as a result of selected potential decreases and increases in the price of each equity security in the portfolio excluding hedged equity securities if any potential fluctuations in the price of each equity security in the portfolio of plus or minus 10 20 and 30 were selected based on potential nearterm changes in those security prices the hypothetical fair values as of july 30 2011 and july 31 2010 are as follows in millions 

 

 there were no significant impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities in fiscal 2011 while there was no such impairment charge in 2010 for fiscal 2009 impairment charges on our investments in publicly traded equity securities were 39 million 

investments in privately held companies 

we have also invested in privately held companies these investments are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using primarily either the cost or the equity method as of july 30 2011 the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 796 million compared with 756 million at july 31 2010 some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in  including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return our impairment charges on investments in privately held companies were 10 million 25 million and 85 million for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

our foreign exchange forward and option contracts are summarized as follows in millions 

 

 we conduct business globally in numerous currencies the direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars however if the us dollar strengthens relative to other currencies such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our sales to the extent it raises the cost of our products to nonus customers and thereby reduces demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect however the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations 

approximately 70 of our operating expenses are usdollar denominated foreign currency fluctuations net of hedging increased our operating expenses by approximately 03 in fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 and 02 in fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 to reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by nonusdollar denominated operating expenses and costs we hedge certain foreign currency forecasted transactions with currency options and forward contracts these hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons in designing a specific hedging approach we consider several factors including offsetting exposures significance of exposures costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument and potential effectiveness of the hedge the gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales 

we also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the shortterm effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables investments and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities the market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables investments and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances our forward and option contracts generally have the following maturities 

 

 we do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for trading purposes

products and services 

we design manufacture and sell ipbased networking and other products related to the communications and it industry and provide services associated with these products and their use our products and services are designed to address a wide range of customers’ needs including improving productivity reducing costs and gaining a competitive advantage in addition our products and services are designed to help customers build their own network infrastructures that support tools and applications that allow them to communicate with key stakeholders including customers prospects business partners suppliers and employees we focus on delivering networking products and solutions that are designed to simplify and secure customers’ network infrastructures we believe that integrating multiple network services into our products helps our customers reduce their total cost of network ownership our product offerings fall into the following categories our core technologies routing and switching advanced technologies and other products in addition to our product offerings we provide a broad range of service offerings including technical support services and advanced services our customer base spans virtually all types of public and private agencies and businesses comprising enterprise businesses service providers commercial customers and consumers 

our products are used individually or as integrated offerings to connect personal and business computing devices to networks or computer networks with each other—whether they are within a building across a campus or around the world our breadth of product and service offerings across multiple technology segments enables us to offer a wide range of products and services to meet customerspecific requirements we also provide products and services that allow customers to transition their various networks to a single multiservice data voice and video network enabling economies of scale 

  

network architectures built on core routing and switching technologies are evolving to accommodate the demands of increasing numbers of users network applications and new networkrelated markets these new markets are a natural extension of our core business are redefined when delivered by the network platform and are what we refer to as market adjacencies our position is not only differentiated by our architectural approach and ip leadership but is strengthened through our experience expertise partners and services our unique value proposition in our view allows us to comprehensively deliver on and accelerate the transformation of these market adjacencies 

in the past several years we have addressed market adjacencies related to our core routing and switching products through the development of various networkrelated offerings in our advanced and emerging technologies groups of products our advanced and emerging technologies offerings build upon our existing competencies which we believe allows us to expand the overall market for our products and services in this respect we have focused our efforts on the following product categories application networking services cisco telepresence systems the cisco unified computing system platform digital media home networking physical security security storage area networking unified communications video systems and wireless technology among others we are in the process of identifying additional advanced and emerging technologies for focus and investment in the future as has been the case from time to time one or more of our currently identified advanced or emerging technologies may be curtailed or eliminated due to market developments or other factors 

we refer to the evolutionary process by which adjacencies arise as market transitions market transitions on which we are focusing primary attention include those related to the increased role of virtualizationthe cloud video collaboration and networked web 20 technologies with regard to virtualizationthe cloud one example of a market in which a significant market transition is underway is the enterprise data center market we believe the market is at an inflection point as awareness grows that intelligent networks are becoming the platform for productivity improvement and global competitiveness we further believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market is accelerating due to changing technology trends such as the increasing adoption of virtualization the rise in scalable processing and the advent of cloud computing and cloudbased it resource deployments and business models these key terms are defined as follows 

virtualization refers to the process of aggregating the current siloed data center resources into unified shared resource pools that can be dynamically delivered to applications on demand thus enabling the ability to move content and applications between devices and the network 

the cloud refers to an information technology hosting and delivery system in which resources such as servers or software applications are no longer tethered to a user’s physical infrastructure but which instead are delivered to and consumed by the user “on demand” as an internetbased service whether singularly or with multiple other users simultaneously 

this virtualization and clouddriven market transition in the enterprise data center market is being brought about through the convergence of networking computing storage and software technologies we are seeking to take advantage of this market transition through among other things our cisco unified computing system platform and cisco nexus product families which are designed to integrate the previously siloed technologies in the enterprise data center with a unified architecture we are also seeking to capitalize on this market transition through the development of cloudbased product and service offerings through which we intend to enable customers to develop and deploy their own cloudrelated it solutions including softwareasaservice saas and otherasaservice xaas solutions 

in addition in fiscal 2010 cisco and emc together with vmware formed the virtual computing environment “vce” coalition to accelerate customers’ ability to increase business agility through greater it infrastructure flexibility and lower it energy and real estate costs through pervasive data center virtualization and a transition to private cloud infrastructures the vce coalition introduced vblock infrastructure packages designed to be fully integrated tested validated scalable and immediately deployable infrastructure packages that combine innovative virtualization networking computing storage security and management technologies from cisco emc and vmware with endtoend vendor accountability  similarly our investment in acadia enterprises llc “acadia” a joint venture with emc in which vmware and intel have also invested is designed to pave the way to new delivery models for cloud computing solutions 

the competitive landscape in the enterprise data center market is changing and we expect there will be a new class of very large wellfinanced and aggressive competitors each bringing its own new class of products to address this new market however with respect to this market we believe the network will be the intersection of innovation through an open ecosystem and standards we expect to see acquisitions further industry consolidation and new alliances among companies as they seek to serve the enterprise data center market as we enter this next market phase we expect that we will strengthen certain strategic alliances compete more with certain strategic alliances and partners and perhaps also encounter new competitors in our attempt to deliver the best solutions for our customers 

other market transitions on which we are focusing primary attention include those related to the increased role of video collaboration and networked web 20 technologies the key market transitions relative to the convergence of video collaboration and networked web 20 technologies which we believe will drive productivity and growth in network loads appear to be evolving even more quickly and more significantly than we had previously anticipated cisco telepresence systems are one example of product offerings that have incorporated video collaboration and networked web 20 technologies as customers evolve their communications and business models we are focused on simplifying and expanding the creation distribution and use of endtoend video solutions for businesses and consumers and our fiscal 2010 acquisition of tandberg asa “tandberg” is an example of our increased emphasis on the video market segment 

  

we believe that the architectural approach that has served us well in addressing the market adjacencies in the communications and information technology industry will be adaptable to other markets examples of market adjacencies where we aim to apply this approach are mobility the consumer and electrical services infrastructure with regard to mobility the growth of ip traffic on handheld devices is driving the need for more robust architectures equipment and services in order to accommodate not only an increasing number of worldwide mobile device users but also increased user demand for broadbandquality business network and consumer web applications to be seamlessly delivered on such devices our fiscal 2010 acquisition of starent networks corp “starent” reflects the significance of this market adjacency and our intent to offer solutions that help expand ip network load capabilities for mobile devices for the consumer market through collaboration with technology partners retailers service providers and content publishers we are striving to create compelling consumer experiences and make the network the platform for a variety of services in the home as broadband development moves from a devicecentric phase to a networkcentric model in the electrical services infrastructure market we are developing an architecture for managing energy in a highly secure fashion on electrical grids at various steps from energy generation to consumption in homes and buildings 

to address these market adjacencies we believe a collaborative strategy is required we believe that we need the subject area and functional skill expertise of not just one person but many within our company accordingly we have developed what we feel is an innovative organizational structure of boards and councils bringing together cisco managers from across many functional areas within our company to collaboratively define plan execute and monitor our progress in these many market adjacencies 

for a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report to shareholders note 15 is incorporated into this report by reference

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors hold inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” among others 

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

  

we provide financing arrangements such as leases financed service contracts and loans for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects leases include salestype direct financing and operating leases we also provide certain qualified customers with the option of financing longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services and typically range from one to three years our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing for the acquisition of our products and services but also may provide additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services for additional information regarding these financing arrangements see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2010 annual report to shareholders note 6 is incorporated into this report by reference 

product backlog 

our product backlog at july 31 2010 the last day of our 2010 fiscal year was approximately 41 billion compared with product backlog of approximately 39 billion at july 25 2009 the last day of our 2009 fiscal year the product backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our product backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net product sales for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all of the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services we work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions investments and alliances we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking and communications products and services 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with accenture ltd att inc cap gemini sa emc corporation fujitsu limited intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa johnson controls inc microsoft corporation nokia corporation nokia siemens networks oracle corporation sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy services ltd vmware inc wipro limited and others companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

  

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets and market adjacencies as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include alcatellucent arris group inc aruba networks inc avaya inc belden inc brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd citrix systems inc dlink corporation lm ericsson telephone company extreme networks inc f5 networks inc force10 networks inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc logmein inc meru networks inc microsoft corporation motorola inc netgear inc polycom inc riverbed technology inc and symantec corporation among others 

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were siloed due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among routers switches advanced technologies and other product technologies for this purpose our research and development expenditures were 53 billion 52 billion and 53 billion in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of focus include but are not limited to cisco telepresence systems products physical security digital media and the cisco unified computing system our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred 

  

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time defined as less than one year we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products in fiscal 2010 and continue to see challenges at some of our component suppliers this was attributable in part to increasing demand driven by the improvement in our overall markets and similar to what is happening in the industry the longer than normal lead time extensions also stemmed from supplier constraints based upon their labor and other actions taken during the global economic downturn 

although we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy we continue to operate manufacturing facilities including a principal facility in juarez mexico for the manufacture of settop boxes the manufacturing operations in juarez range from automated assembly lines for volume production to complete assembly of a particular product by one individual or a small group of individuals 




 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as to specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 instability in the global credit markets including the recent european economic and financial turmoil related to sovereign debt issues in certain countries the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions such as changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment the world has recently experienced a global macroeconomic downturn and if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

during the recent global economic downturn and while the related market uncertainty persists we have been investing in market adjacencies and also in the united states and targeted emerging countries and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we have been realigning and are dedicating resources to focus on certain market adjacencies such as enterprise data center virtualization videovisual networking collaboration architectures and globalization primarily in targeted geographic locations and to focus efforts particularly where we believe the economic recovery will progress the fastest such as the united states and targeted emerging countries creating opportunities for us even while other countries or markets may not be recovering however the return on our investments in such market adjacencies and in such geographic markets may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of the recent global economic downturn and related market uncertainty our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline which recently occurred in fiscal 2009 our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which we and our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in the united states and in our emerging markets theater and other emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

inventory management remains an area of focus we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products in fiscal 2010 this was attributable in part to increasing demand driven by the improvement in our overall markets and similar to what is happening in the industry the longer than normal lead time extensions also stemmed from supplier constraints based upon their labor and other actions taken during the global economic downturn we continue to see challenges at some of our component suppliers longer manufacturing lead times in the past have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively in addition our efforts to improve manufacturing leadtime performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results in addition we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which have contributed to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

  

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

  

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain of our advanced technologies in addition to longer sales cycles in the past we have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers over certain extended periods of time as market conditions have fluctuated sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition for example during fiscal 2009 we experienced a slowdown in service provider capital expenditures globally which may recur in future periods orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 

 

  

   

  

 in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets and market adjacencies as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 of this report 

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were siloed due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the application of these converging technologies is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

  

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors and retail partners generally is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements we continue to see challenges at some of our component suppliers and have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 

 

  

 a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products in fiscal 2010 and we continue to see challenges at some of our component suppliers see the risk factor above entitled “our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results” 

  

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts a return to growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity especially for laborintensive components components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply or reramping manufacturing capacity for highly complex products for example during fiscal 2010 we experienced longer than normal lead times on several of our products and we continue to see challenges at some of our component suppliers this was attributable in part to increasing demand driven by the improvement in our overall markets and similar to what is happening in the industry the longer than normal lead time extensions also stemmed from supplier constraints based upon their labor and other actions taken during the global economic downturn if shortages or delays persist or worsen the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources especially during times such as we are currently seeing when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future 

 

  

  

 manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which have contributed to an increase in purchase commitments increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in our 2010 annual report to shareholders which note is incorporated into this report by reference 

our key manufacturing facility for scientificatlanta’s products is located in juarez mexico and we may be materially and adversely affected by any prolonged disruption in the operation of this facility 

  

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe the industry is evolving to enable personal and business process collaboration enabled by networked web 20 the technologies that enable user collaboration as part of the second major phase of the internet as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multipleparty collaborative interaction would demand and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable networked web 20 and the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it in fiscal 2009 we launched our cisco unified computing system our nextgeneration enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing network storage access and virtualization resources in a single system which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center cisco unified computing system is one of several market adjacencies on which we are focusing resources 

the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in market adjacencies and in the united states and targeted emerging countries mentioned above to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking to collaborative systems does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share net sales and earnings the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies that we identify as “emerging technologies” or “advanced technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or advanced technologies 

over the long term we intend to increase our investment in engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while recently we have focused on managing our costs and expenses we expect to continue to increase our headcount in upcoming quarters and over the long term we intend to continue to add personnel and other resources to our engineering sales service marketing and manufacturing functions as we focus on developing market adjacencies emerging technologies the next wave of advanced technologies growing the commercial market segment capitalizing on our emerging market opportunities enhancing our evolving support model and increasing our market share gains we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of networked web 20 as part of the second major phase of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or economic uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure as we have recently seen we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

  

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 acquisitions may also cause us to 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities—for example storage wireless security transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network and other advanced technologies emerging technologies and market adjacencies—we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in the emerging markets theater demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets including our entry into the consumer market has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

  

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins in the past we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped although the cost of such remediation has not been material in the past there can be no assurance that such a remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states maintain a manufacturing facility for a substantial portion of our video systems products in juarez mexico and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners although sales in our emerging markets theater decreased during the recent global economic downturn our emerging markets theater generally has been a relatively fast growing theater and we have announced plans to expand our commitments and expectations in this theater as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into this theater we also intend to expand our level of business activity in two large emerging countries india and china and our growth in the asia pacific theater will also depend in part upon our increasing sales in these countries our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors relating to our operations outside the united states any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the recent global economic downturn and related market uncertainty including increased demand from customers in certain countries within our emerging markets theater we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us 

  

furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales taxes on internet product sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities 

  

in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict for example brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of our current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes and related penalties the claims are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and aggregate to approximately 190 million for the alleged evasion of import taxes approximately 85 million for interest and approximately 16 billion for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 31 2010 we have completed a thorough review of the matter and believe the asserted tax claims against us are without merit and we intend to defend the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for our alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against us and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we have investigated the alleged improper transactions referred to above we communicated with united states authorities to provide information and report on our findings and the united states authorities have investigated such allegations an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that may be affected by recent volcanic activity which could disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane volcano or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments during fiscal 2009 we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in our 2010 annual report to shareholders which section is incorporated by reference into this report our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and have established a joint venture to market services associated with our cisco unified computing system products these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties joint ventures can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners 

  

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of senior unsecured debt 

in february 2006 we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 65 billion of which 500 million matured in february 2009 30 billion will mature in february 2011 and the balance will mature in february 2016 in addition in february 2009 we issued an aggregate of 40 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature at specific dates in 2019 and 2039 a portion of the proceeds of the notes issued in february 2009 was used to repay in full the notes that matured that month also in november 2009 we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 50 billion of which 500 million will mature in november 2014 25 billion will mature in january 2020 and the balance will mature in january 2040 the outstanding notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to repay these notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities

 item 3 legal proceedings 

brazilian authorities have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of our current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian authorities have assessed claims against our brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import taxes and related penalties the claims are for calendar years 2003 through 2007 and aggregate to approximately 190 million for the alleged evasion of import taxes 85 million for interest and approximately 16 billion for various penalties all determined using an exchange rate as of july 31 2010 we have completed a thorough review of the matter and believe the asserted tax claims against us are without merit and we intend to defend the claims vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for our alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against us and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any we do not expect a final judicial determination for several years 

we have investigated the alleged improper transactions referred to above we communicated with united states authorities to provide information and report on our findings and the united states authorities have investigated such allegations 

we and other defendants were subject to patent claims asserted by network1 security solutions inc on february 7 2008 in the federal district court for the eastern district of texas network1 alleged that various of our products implement a method for remotely powering equipment that infringes united states patent no 6218930 network1 sought monetary damages the trial on these claims began on july 12 2010 during trial we and network1 settled our dispute on terms that are not material to us and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on august 6 2010 

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including intellectual property litigation while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for additional information regarding intellectual property litigation see “part i item 1a risk factors—we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” herein

we conduct our business globally and are managed geographically in five segments united states and canada european markets emerging markets asia pacific and japan the emerging markets theater consists of eastern europe latin america the middle east and africa and russia and the commonwealth of independent states for revenue and other information regarding these segments see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report to shareholders note 15 is incorporated into this report by reference 

we were incorporated in california in december 1984 and our headquarters are in san jose california the mailing address of our headquarters is 170 west tasman drive san jose california 951341706 and our telephone number at that location is 408 5264000 our website is wwwciscocom  through a link on the investor relations section of our website we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the securities and exchange commission “sec” our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13a or 15d of the exchange act all such filings are available free of charge 

products and services 

we sell ipbased networking and other products and services related to the communications and it industry our products and services are designed to address a wide range of customers’ needs including improving productivity reducing costs and gaining a competitive advantage in addition our products and services are designed to help customers build their own network infrastructures that support tools and applications that allow them to communicate with key stakeholders including customers prospects business partners suppliers and employees we focus on delivering networking products and solutions that are designed to simplify and secure customers’ network infrastructures we believe that integrating multiple network services into our products helps our customers reduce their total cost of network ownership our product offerings fall into the following categories our core technologies routing and switching advanced technologies and other products in addition to our product offerings we provide a broad range of service offerings including technical support services and advanced services our customer base spans virtually all types of public and private agencies and businesses comprising enterprise businesses service providers commercial customers and consumers 

our products are used individually or as integrated offerings to connect personal and business computing devices to networks or computer networks with each other—whether they are within a building across a campus or around the world our breadth of product and service offerings across multiple technology segments enables us to offer a wide range of products and services to meet customerspecific requirements we also provide products and services that allow customers to transition their various networks to a single multiservice data voice and video network enabling economies of scale 

  

as network architectures have become more robust to accommodate the demands of increasing numbers of users requiring an increasing array of network applications new networkrelated product markets have arisen alongside our core routing and switching markets we refer to these new markets that are similar related or adjacent to those in which we are active as market adjacencies 

in the past several years we have addressed market adjacencies related to our core routing and switching products through the development of various networkrelated offerings in our advanced technologies product category each of our advanced technologies product offerings as with product evolutions in our core routing and switching categories builds upon our existing competencies and we believe allows us to expand the overall market for our products and services in our pursuit of market adjacencies related to our routing and switching products we have focused our efforts on the following advanced technology product categories application networking services home networking security storage area networking unified communications video systems and wireless technology we have also continued to focus on developing a new wave of technologies which we refer to as emerging technologies which includes product areas such as cisco telepresence systems physical security digital media and the cisco unified computing system we are in the process of identifying additional advanced technologies for focus and investment in the future as has been the case from time to time in the past one or more of our currently identified advanced technologies may be curtailed or eliminated due to market developments or other factors 

we refer to the evolutionary process by which adjacencies arise as market transitions one example of a market in which a significant market transition appears to be underway is the enterprise data center market we believe the market is at an inflection point as awareness grows that intelligent networks are becoming the platform for productivity improvement and global competitiveness we further believe that disruption in the enterprise data center market will accelerate in the next 12 months due to changing technology trends such as the increasing adoption of virtualization and the rise in scalable processing virtualization is the process of aggregating the current siloed data center resources into unified shared resource pools that can be dynamically delivered to applications on demand thus providing the ability to move content and applications between devices and the network 

this market transition is being brought about through the convergence of networking computing storage and software technologies we are seeking to capitalize on this market transition through among other things our cisco unified computing system and cisco nexus product families which are designed to integrate the previously siloed technologies in the enterprise data center with a unified architecture 

the competitive landscape in our markets is changing and we expect there will be a new class of very large wellfinanced and aggressive competitors each bringing its own new class of products to address this new enterprise data center market however with respect to this market we believe the network will be the intersection of innovation through an open ecosystem and standards we expect to see acquisitions industry consolidation and new alliances among companies as they seek to serve the enterprise data center market as we enter this next market phase we expect that we will strengthen certain strategic alliances compete more with certain strategic alliances and partners and perhaps also encounter new competitors in our attempt to deliver the best solutions for our customers 

other market adjacencies on which we are focusing attention include those related to the increased role of video collaboration and networked web 20 technologies across our customer markets the key market transitions relative to the convergence of video collaboration and networked web 20 technologies which we believe will drive productivity and growth in network loads appear to be evolving even faster than we had anticipated earlier this year cisco telepresence systems are one example of our product offerings that have incorporated video collaboration and networked web 20 technologies as customers evolve their communications and business models 

we believe that the architectural approach that has served us well in addressing the market adjacencies in the communications and information technology industry will be adaptable to other markets examples of market adjacencies where we aim to apply this approach are the consumer electrical services infrastructure and video market segments for the consumer market through collaboration with technology partners retailers service providers and content publishers we are striving to create compelling consumer experiences and make the network the platform for a variety of services in the home as broadband development moves from a devicecentric phase to a networkcentric model in the electrical services infrastructure market we are developing an architecture for managing energy in a highly secure fashion on electrical grids at various steps from energy generation to consumption in homes and buildings with regard to the video market segment we are focused on simplifying and expanding the creation distribution and use of endtoend video solutions for businesses and consumers 

  

in order to manage our pursuit of diverse market adjacencies we believe we need the subject area and functional skill expertise of not just one person but many within our company accordingly we have developed what we feel is an innovative organizational structure of boards and councils bringing together cisco managers from across many functional areas within our company to collaboratively define plan execute and monitor our progress in these many market adjacencies while we believe that this collaborative management approach will allow us to take advantage of these often rapidly evolving market transitions and resulting opportunities this is a new management approach for us and therefore there can be no assurance that this organizational structure will help to produce revenue and market share successes in these market adjacencies

customers and markets 

many factors influence the it collaboration and networking requirements of our customers these include the size of the organization number and types of technology systems geographic location and the business applications deployed throughout the network our customer base is not limited to any specific industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales our customers primarily operate in the following markets enterprise service provider commercial and consumer 

enterprise 

enterprise businesses are large regional national or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1000 or more employees many enterprise businesses have unique it collaboration and networking needs within a multivendor environment our enterprise customers also include public sector entities and governments we take advantage of the network as the platform to integrate business processes with technology architectures to assist customer growth we offer service and support packages financing and managed network services through our service provider partners we sell these products through a network of thirdparty application and technology vendors and channel partners 

  

service providers 

service providers offer data voice video and mobilewireless services to businesses governments utilities and consumers worldwide they include regional national and international wireline carriers as well as internet cable and wireless providers we also group media broadcast and web portal providers within our service provider market as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional networkbased services and contentbased and applicationbased services service providers use a variety of our routing and switching optical security video connected home mobility and network management products and systems in their own networks in addition many service providers use cisco data center virtualization and collaboration technologies to offer managed or internetbased services to their business customers these technologies include cisco unified communications and call center products and applications cisco webex collaboration tools and cisco telepresence systems as well as other video and security products and systems that can be incorporated into networkattached data centers compared with other customers service providers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services because of the scale and complexity of their networks 

commercial 

generally we define commercial businesses as companies with fewer than 1000 employees the larger or midmarket customers within the commercial market are served by a combination of our direct salesforce and our channel partners these customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand but with less complexity small businesses or companies with fewer than 100 employees require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure install and maintain these smaller companies within the commercial market are primarily served by our channel partners 

consumer 

consumer customers are individuals who use the network at home or while away from home for personal use to enjoy a broad range of entertainment communications and information experiences cisco is able to deliver these solutions to consumers through an extensive vendor network of retailers partners service and content providers and direct online retailers the flip video family of camcorders represents a new addition to our consumer product line having been added to our product portfolio through the acquisition of pure digital technologies inc during fiscal 2009 the flip video family of camcorders is designed to make video simple accessible and fun by allowing people to easily capture and edit videos and then share them instantly with friends family and on popular videosharing websites 

sales overview 

as of the end of fiscal 2009 our worldwide sales and marketing department consisted of approximately 23250 employees including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in approximately 90 countries and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners 

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution some service providers are also systems integrators 

distributors hold inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

for information regarding risks related to our channels see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” among others 

  

our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting technical project quality and maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers 

we provide financing arrangements such as leases financed service contracts and loans for certain qualified customers to build maintain and upgrade their networks we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects leases include salestype direct financing and operating leases we also provide certain qualified customers with the option of financing longterm service contracts which primarily relate to technical support services and typically range from one to three years our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing for the acquisition of our products and services but also may provide additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services for additional information regarding these financing arrangements see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2009 annual report to shareholders note 6 is incorporated into this report by reference 

backlog 

our backlog at july 25 2009 the last day of our 2009 fiscal year was approximately 39 billion compared with backlog of approximately 48 billion at july 26 2008 the last day of our 2008 fiscal year the backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services we work to broaden the range of products and services we deliver to customers in target markets through acquisitions investments and alliances we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking and communications products and services 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with accenture ltd att inc cap gemini sa emc corporation fujitsu limited intel corporation international business 

  

machines corporation italtel spa johnson controls inc microsoft corporation nokia nokia siemens networks oracle corporation sap ag sprint nextel corporation tata consultancy services ltd vmware inc wipro limited and others companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets and market adjacencies as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include alcatellucent arris group inc aruba networks inc avaya inc belden inc brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd citrix systems inc dlink corporation lm ericsson telephone company extreme networks inc f5 networks inc force10 networks inc fortinet inc hewlettpackard company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc logmein inc meru networks inc microsoft corporation motorola inc netgear inc nortel networks corporation riverbed technology inc and symantec corporation among others 

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were siloed due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the application of these converging technologies is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets we allocate our research and development budget among routers switches advanced technologies and other product technologies for this purpose our research and development expenditures were 52 billion 53 billion and 46 billion in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively these expenditures are applied generally to all product areas with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time recent areas of focus include but are not limited to cisco telepresence systems physical security digital media and the cisco unified computing system our expenditures for research and development costs as well as inprocess research and development of 63 million 3 million and 81 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively were expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test product repair and product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

although we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy we continue to operate manufacturing facilities including a principal facility in juarez mexico for the manufacture of settop boxes the manufacturing operations in juarez range from automated assembly lines for volume production to complete assembly of a particular product by one individual or small group of individuals 

  




 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could 

  

adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as to specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 

 

  

  

  

  

 the turmoil in the global credit markets the instability in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and other disruptions such as changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment the world has been experiencing a global macroeconomic downturn and if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets remain uncertain persist or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

during the global economic downturn and while the related market uncertainty persists we have been investing in market adjacencies and also in the united states and select emerging countries and if the return on these investments is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating results may be harmed 

we continue to realign resources to focus on certain market adjacencies such as enterprise data center virtualization videovisual networking collaboration architectures and globalization primarily in targeted geographic locations moreover since we believe the united states will be among the first major countries to recover from the global economic downturn we continue to make a significant portion of these investments in the united states so that we can be positioned to benefit from this future recovery while other countries or markets may not be recovering additionally we believe countries such as china and india are positioned to minimize the effect of the global challenges on their own economies creating opportunities for us even while other countries or markets may not be recovering however the return on our investments in such market adjacencies and in such geographic markets may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of the global economic downturn and related market uncertainty our net sales declined in fiscal 2009 and may decline further or may grow at a slower rate than in past periods our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which we and our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in our emerging markets theater and other emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

  

in addition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to attempt to improve our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers in the past to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain of our advanced technologies in addition to longer sales cycles in the past we have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers over certain extended periods of time as market conditions have fluctuated sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in 

  

orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers which may be more prevalent in the global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition for example during fiscal 2009 we experienced a slowdown in service provider capital expenditures globally which may continue in future quarters orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 

 

  

  

  

 in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets and market adjacencies as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitors see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 of this report 

  

some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas 

for example the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies including computing networking storage and software that previously were siloed due to several factors including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors applicationspecific integrated circuits offering advanced services standards based protocols cloud computing and virtualization the application of these converging technologies is spanning multiple previously independent technology segments also some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center as a result of all of these developments we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies including competition from entities that are among our longterm strategic alliance partners companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

  

supply chain issues including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers or a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our costs or caused a delay in our ability to fulfill orders could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results 

 

  

 a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts a return to growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources and the global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact one or more of these sources we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future 

 

  

  

 manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements contained in our 2009 annual report to shareholders which note is incorporated into this report by reference 

  

our key manufacturing facility for scientificatlanta’s products is located in juarez mexico and we may be materially and adversely affected by any prolonged disruption in the operation of this facility 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe the industry is evolving to enable personal and business process collaboration enabled by networked web 20 the technologies that enable user collaboration as part of the second major phase of the internet as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multiple party collaborative interaction would demand and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable networked web 20 and the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it also in march 2009 we launched our unified computing system ucs our nextgeneration enterprise data center platform architected to unite computing network storage access and virtualization resources in a single system which is designed to address the fundamental transformation occurring in the enterprise data center ucs is one of several market adjacencies on which we are focusing resources the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources including the investments we have been making in market adjacencies and in the united states and select emerging countries mentioned above to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking to collaborative systems does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share net sales and earnings the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the products and technologies that we identify as “emerging technologies” such as cisco telepresence systems or “advanced technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or advanced technologies 

over the long term we intend to increase our investment in engineering sales service and manufacturing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

while recently we have focused on managing our costs and expenses over the long term we intend to continue to add personnel and other resources to our engineering sales service and manufacturing functions as we focus on developing emerging technologies the next wave of advanced technologies growing the commercial market segment capitalizing on our emerging market opportunities enhancing our evolving support model and increasing our market share gains we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of networked web 20 as part of the second major phase of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure as we are currently seeing we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

  

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 acquisitions may also cause us to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in charges in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities—for example storage wireless security transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network and other advanced technologies emerging technologies and market adjacencies—we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in the emerging markets theater demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets including our entry into the consumer market has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations for example some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions or announced new strategic alliances designed to position them with the ability to provide endtoend technology solutions for the enterprise data center companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins in the past we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped although the cost of such remediation has not been material in the past there can be no assurance that such a remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states maintain a manufacturing facility for a substantial portion of our video systems products in juarez mexico and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers component suppliers and distribution partners although sales in our emerging markets theater have 

  

decreased during the global economic downturn in recent prior periods our emerging markets theater has been a relatively fast growing theater and we have announced plans to expand our commitments and expectations in this theater as such our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into this theater we also intend to expand our level of business activity in two large emerging countries india and china and our growth in the asia pacific theater will also depend in part upon our increasing sales in these countries our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors relating to our operations outside the united states any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue and recently we have been experiencing an increase in this demand as the credit markets have been impacted by the global economic downturn and related market uncertainty we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by the global economic downturn or if there is a continuation or worsening of the downturn although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in europe 

  

latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as 

  

voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales taxes on internet product sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various requirements and regulations of the federal communications commission and other regulatory authorities in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict in addition brazilian authorities are investigating our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to the allegation of evading import taxes and other alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer we are conducting a thorough review of the matter during fiscal 2009 brazilian authorities asserted claims against us for calendar years 2003 and 2004 and we believe claims may also be asserted for calendar year 2005 through calendar year 2007 we believe the asserted claims are without merit and intend to defend the claims vigorously in addition we are investigating the allegations regarding improper transactions we have proactively communicated with united states authorities to provide information and report on our findings and the united states authorities are currently investigating such allegations an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments by changes in accounting principles or by changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules for example during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 a us federal court of appeals ruling impacted a tax position of cisco as a result of that ruling we recorded a onetime tax charge of 174 million and there was a reduction of additional paidin capital of approximately 550 million significant judgment is required to 

  

determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes —an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” fin 48 applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if such investments suffer market price declines as we experienced with some of our investments during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in our 2009 annual report to shareholders which section is incorporated by reference into this report our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however these alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 

  

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of senior unsecured debt 

in february 2006 we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 65 billion of which 500 million matured in february 2009 30 billion will mature in february 2011 and the balance will mature in february 2016 in addition in february 2009 we issued an aggregate of 40 billion of senior unsecured notes that mature at specific dates in 2019 and 2039 a portion of the proceeds of the notes issued in february 2009 was used to repay in full the notes that matured that month the outstanding notes bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually the fair value of the longterm debt is subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions in addition we will be required to have available in the united states sufficient cash to repay these notes on maturity there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities

 item 3 legal proceedings 

brazilian authorities are investigating our brazilian subsidiary and certain of its current and former employees as well as a brazilian importer of our products and its affiliates and employees relating to the allegation of evading import taxes and other alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer we are conducting a thorough review of the matter during fiscal 2009 brazilian authorities asserted claims against us for calendar years 2003 and 2004 and we believe claims may also be asserted for calendar year 2005 through calendar year 2007 we believe the asserted claims are without merit and intend to defend the claims vigorously we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome on any potential further claims against us while we believe there is no legal basis for our alleged liability due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any in addition we are investigating the allegations regarding improper transactions we have proactively communicated with united states authorities to provide information and report on our findings and the united states authorities are currently investigating such allegations

backlog 

our backlog at july 26 2008 the last day of our 2008 fiscal year was approximately 48 billion compared with backlog of approximately 39 billion at july 28 2007 the last day of our 2007 fiscal year backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services through acquisitions investments and alliances we work to broaden the range of products and services we are able to deliver to customers in target markets we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking and communications products and services 

 

  

  

  

 acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with accenture ltd att inc bearingpoint inc cap gemini sa dell inc emc corporation fujitsu limited hewlettpackard company intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa microsoft corporation nokia nokia siemens networks oracle corporation siemens ag sitronics telecom solutions czech republic as sprint nextel corporation thrupoint inc and wipro limited among others companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from 

  

china and we anticipate this will continue 

our competitors include alcatellucent arris group inc aruba networks inc avaya inc belden cdt inc brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd dlink corporation lm ericsson telephone company extreme networks inc f5 networks inc force10 networks inc fortinet inc foundry networks inc hewlettpackard company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc meru networks inc microsoft corporation motorola inc netgear inc nortel networks corporation riverbed technology inc and symantec corporation among others 

some of these companies compete across multiple product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features in areas including routers switches advanced technologies and other product technologies our research and development expenditures were 52 billion 45 billion and 41 billion in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively all of our expenditures for research and development costs as well as inprocess research and development of 3 million 81 million and 91 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively have been expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge still there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that such products will achieve market acceptance 

  

manufacturing 

we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printedcircuit board assembly incircuit test and product repair as well as product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls that are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to international organization for standardization iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

although we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy we continue to operate the facilities acquired in the february 2006 acquisition of scientificatlanta inc “scientificatlanta” including scientificatlanta’s principal facility in juarez mexico the manufacturing operations in juarez range from automated assembly lines for volume production to complete assembly of a particular product by one individual or small group of individuals 




 item 1a risk factors tableend set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed 

  

elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as to specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 

 

  

  

  

  

 recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world and changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment such as the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the united states if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets remain uncertain or persist spread or deteriorate further we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as in potential additional inventory managementrelated costs in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which we and our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

the timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter primarily in our emerging markets theater and other emerging countries from time to time we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue the timing of such orders is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in net sales as a result our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 

in addition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to attempt to improve our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers in the past to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

  

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain of our advanced technologies in addition to longer sales cycles in the past we have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers over certain extended periods of time as market conditions have fluctuated sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations weakness in orders from this industry including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition we have seen a slowdown in capital expenditures by a few of our service provider customers and believe there may be potential for a broader slowdown in the global service provider market   in the next few quarters orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets for example in the past many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy by overcapacity by changes in the service provider market by regulatory developments and by constraints on capital availability resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past and some of 

  

these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 

 

  

  

 in addition we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements to the extent that they fail to do so that could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

  

a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts especially if the economy grows growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future 

 

  

  

 manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2008 annual report to shareholders which note is incorporated into this report by reference 

a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease 

the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our operating results financial problems of contract manufacturers on which we rely or reservation of manufacturing capacity by other companies inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase costs 

our key manufacturing facility for scientificatlanta’s products is located in juarez mexico and we may be materially and adversely affected by any prolonged disruption in the operation of this facility 

  

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 of this report 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe the industry is evolving to enable personal and business process collaboration enabled by networked web 20 the technologies that enable user collaboration as part of the second major phase of the internet as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multiple party collaborative interaction would demand and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable networked web 20 and the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and it the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking to collaborative systems does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share net sales and earnings the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or 

  

technologies obsolete or noncompetitive specifically the products and technologies that we identify as “emerging technologies” such as cisco telepresence systems or “advanced technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or advanced technologies 

we are increasing our investment in engineering sales service and manufacturing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

we intend to continue to add personnel and other resources to our engineering sales service and manufacturing functions as we focus on developing emerging technologies the next wave of advanced technologies growing the commercial market segment capitalizing on our emerging market opportunities enhancing our evolving support model and increasing our market share gains we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of networked web 20 as part of the second major phase of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 acquisitions may also cause us to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in inprocess research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities—for example storage wireless security transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network and other advanced technologies and emerging technologies—we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in the emerging markets theater demand for these types of service support or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities 

  

further provision of greater levels of services support and financing by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets including our entry into the consumer market has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins in the past we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped although the cost of such remediation has not been material in the past there can be no assurance that such a remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states maintain a manufacturing facility for a substantial portion of our video systems products in juarez mexico and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers and our distribution partners recently our emerging markets theater has been a relatively fast growing theater and we have announced plans to expand our commitments and growth expectations in this theater as such our growth depends in part on our continuing to increase sales into this theater we also intend to expand our level of business activity in two large emerging countries india and china and our growth in the asia pacific theater will also depend in part upon our continuing to increase sales in these countries our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors relating to our operations outside the united states any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others foreign currency exchange rates political or social unrest economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region environmental and trade protection measures and other legal and regulatory requirements some of which may affect our ability to import our products to export our products from or sell our products in various countries political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries 

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if there is an economic slowdown although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 

  

in the past there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations additionally to the degree that the recent turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim 

  

against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales taxes on internet product sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various federal communications commission requirements and regulations in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and sharebased compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

  

adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict in addition brazilian authorities are investigating certain employees of our brazilian subsidiary and certain employees of a brazilian importer of our products relating to the allegation of evading import taxes and other alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer we are conducting a thorough review of the matter to date brazilian authorities have not asserted a claim against us in addition we are investigating the allegations regarding improper transactions we have proactively communicated with united states authorities to provide information and report on our findings and the united states authorities are currently investigating such allegations an unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the postacquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions into our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement by tax effects of nondeductible compensation by tax costs related to intercompany realignments or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations thereof significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in financial interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxesan interpretation of fasb statement no 109” “fin 48” in addition fin 48 applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely impact our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit 

  

the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax our portfolio includes fixed income securities and equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if the market price declines we may recognize in earnings the decline in fair value of our investments below the cost basis when the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in our 2008 annual report to shareholders which section is incorporated by reference into this report our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however these alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

we have issued 65 billion of senior unsecured notes and there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected 

we have issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 65 billion that mature at specific dates in 2009 2011 and 2016 the notes that mature in 2009 bear floatingrate interest payable quarterly while the notes that mature in 2011 and 2016 bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually during the third quarter of fiscal 2008 we terminated 60 billion of interest rate swaps which previously had the effect of converting fixedrate interest expense to floatingrate interest expense based on libor as a result the fair value of the longterm debt is effectively subject to market interest rate volatility the instruments governing the notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions we had not previously undertaken substantial amounts of debt for borrowed money there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities

we believe some of our advanced technologies may continue to grow over time to become material contributors to our overall business each of our advanced technologies in addition to our core switching and routing businesses builds upon our existing competencies and allows us to expand the overall market for our products and services we have currently identified the following advanced technologies application networking services home networking hosted smallbusiness systems security storage area networking unified communications video systems and wireless technology we are in the process of identifying additional advanced technologies for focus and investment in the future and our investments in some presently identified advanced technologies may be curtailed or eliminated depending on market developments beginning in fiscal 2007 our sales of optical networking products are no longer included in our advanced technologies product category and instead are included in the other product category prior fiscal years have been reclassified to reflect this change we have also continued to focus on developing a new wave of technologies which we refer to as emerging technologies including such products as digital media telepresence and physical security among others 

the investments we have made and our architectural approach are based on the belief that collaboration and “web 20” the technologies that enable user collaboration including such technologies as unified communications and telepresence and the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and information technology will create new market opportunities for us as part of the second major phase of the internet we believe the industry is evolving as both personal and business process collaboration and web 20 help to increase innovation and productivity with the acquisition of scientificatlanta in february 2006 we enhanced our video capabilities to help enable the convergence of data voice and video technologies in addition we seek to form and strengthen strategic business relationships with key service provider customers and to reach a broad range of consumers with our enhanced product line as a result of this acquisition we believe that video applications such as our unified communications and telepresence products have the potential to accelerate the growth of bandwidth demands and to increase loads on networks which may require upgrades to existing networks 

many of our strategic initiatives and investments are also based on our vision of the evolution of the network over time we believe that the internet and the various networks associated with it including corporate intranets cable broadband and dialup networks and voice and video networks will evolve to include embedded resources and the virtualization of applications and services to produce an integrated intelligent system this is our vision for the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems in this evolving environment we believe successful vendors will be capable of providing a broad spectrum of products aimed not at a particular technology platform but at solutions to networking problems that span all segments as such we aim many of our strategic initiatives and investments at meeting the requirements that an intelligent network would demand making the network the platform for the next generation of valueadded communications for a discussion of the risks associated with that strategy please see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report to shareholders which note is incorporated into this report by reference

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations please see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

our service offerings complement our products via a range of consulting technical project quality and maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers we facilitate and provide lease and other financing through our wholly owned subsidiaries to certain qualified customers for the purchase of equipment and other needs for additional information regarding these financing activities see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated into this report by reference 

backlog 

our backlog at july 28 2007 the last day of our 2007 fiscal year was approximately 39 billion compared with backlog of approximately 30 billion at july 29 2006 the last day of our 2006 fiscal year backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 

  

acquisitions investments and alliances 

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services through acquisitions investments and alliances we are able to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets 

we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking products and services we develop new technologies and products internally we enter into jointdevelopment efforts with other companies we resell other companies’ products and we acquire all or parts of other companies 

acquisitions 

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

investments in privately held companies 

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

strategic alliances 

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with accenture ltd att inc bearingpoint inc cap gemini sa electronic data systems corporation emc corporation fujitsu limited hewlettpackard company intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa microsoft corporation nokia nokia siemens networks siemens ag sitronics telecom solutions czech republic as sprint nextel corporation and wipro limited among others companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas the risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development” 

competition 

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially china and we anticipate this will continue companies with whom we compete in some areas we may also have strategic alliances with in other areas 

our competitors include alcatellucent arris group inc aruba networks inc avaya inc brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ltd dlink corporation lm ericsson telephone company extreme networks inc f5 networks inc force10 networks inc fortinet inc foundry networks inc hewlettpackard company huawei technologies co ltd international business machines corporation juniper networks inc meru networks inc microsoft corporation motorola inc netgear inc nortel networks corporation riverbed technology inc symantec corporation and trapeze networks inc among others 

some of these companies compete across multiple product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources 

  

than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products 

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we also face competition from customers to whom we license or supply technology and suppliers from whom we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

research and development 

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features in areas including routers switches advanced technologies and other product technologies our research and development expenditures were 45 billion 41 billion and 33 billion in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively all of our expenditures for research and development costs as well as inprocess research and development of 81 million 91 million and 26 million in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively have been expensed as incurred 

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge still there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that such products will achieve market acceptance 

manufacturing 

we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services although we continue to operate the scientificatlanta manufacturing facilities acquired in the scientificatlanta acquisition including its principal facility in juarez mexico scientificatlanta’s manufacturing operations range from automated assembly lines for volume production to complete assembly of a particular product by one individual or small group of individuals we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printed circuit board assembly incircuit test and product repair as well as product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements the manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and 

  

statistical process controls that are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we fully implemented the lean manufacturing model which we began transitioning to in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 

we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors these factors include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries at large as well as to specific segments and markets in which we operate resulting in 

 

  

  

  

  

 recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including terrorist activities and military actions particularly the continuing tension in and surrounding iraq and changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment if global economic and market conditions or economic conditions in the united states or other key markets deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as leading to additional costs arising out of inventory management in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which we and our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

in addition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to attempt to improve our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers in the past to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively 

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

  

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

our level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

  

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 

 

  

  

 our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by larger and more uneven purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain of our advanced technologies in addition to longer sales cycles we have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers over certain extended periods of time as market conditions have fluctuated sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations although some service providers may have increased capital expenditures over the depressed levels that have prevailed over the last few years weakness in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition slowdowns in the general economy overcapacity changes in the service provider market regulatory developments and constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers with many of these customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results and we expect that some or all of these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of services including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts especially if the economy grows growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels 

  

if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future 

 

  

  

 manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints including those caused by any possible disruption related to our recently completed implementation of the lean manufacturing model could be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2007 annual report to shareholders which note is incorporated into this report by reference 

a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease 

the fact that we do not own the bulk of our manufacturing facilities could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our operating results financial problems of contract manufacturers on whom we rely or reservation of manufacturing capacity by other companies inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase costs 

our key manufacturing facilities for scientificatlanta’s products are located in juarez mexico and we may be materially and adversely affected by any prolonged disruption in the operation of this facility 

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our revenue growth 

the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer relative advantages these market factors represent a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 of this report 

  

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe the industry is evolving to enable personal and business process collaboration enabled by web 20 the technologies that enable user collaboration as part of the second major phase of the internet as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that a network capable of multiple party collaborative interaction would demand and the investments we have made and our architectural approach are designed to enable web 20 and the increased use of the network as the platform for all forms of communications and information technology the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking to collaborative systems does not emerge as we believe it will or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share net sales and earnings the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive specifically the products and technologies that we identify as “emerging technologies” such as our telepresence products or “advanced technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or advanced technologies 

we are increasing our investment in engineering sales and manufacturing activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

we intend to continue to add personnel and other resources to our engineering sales and manufacturing functions as we focus on developing emerging technologies the next wave of advanced technologies growing the commercial market segment capitalizing on our emerging market opportunities enhancing our evolving support model and increasing our market share gains we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on the continued growth and evolution of the internet to the extent that an economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be certain performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased 

  

intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 acquisitions may also cause us to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in inprocess research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

as we focus on new market opportunities—for example storage wireless security and transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network and other advanced technologies and emerging technologies—we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past demand for these types of service or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities further provision of greater levels of services by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets including our entry into the consumer market has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins in the past we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped although the cost of such remediation has not been material in the past there can be no assurance that such a remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition 

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states maintain a manufacturing facility for a substantial portion of our video systems products in juarez mexico and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers and our distribution partners recently our emerging markets theater has been the fastest growing of our business segments and our growth depends in part on our continuing to increase sales into this theater our future results could be 

  

materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors relating to our operations outside the united states any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including among others foreign currency exchange rates political or social unrest economic instability or natural disasters in a specific country or region environmental and trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import our products to export our products from or sell our products in various countries political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services and for working capital purposes we do not recognize revenue on customer loan financing arrangements until cash payments are received 

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if there is an economic slowdown although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations 

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the 

  

united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales taxes on internet product sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

changes in telecommunications requirements or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the 

  

sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various federal communications commission requirements and regulations in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock option grants are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the adoption of sfas 123r or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition 

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries which have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries which have higher tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities by expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws by transfer pricing adjustments including the postacquisition integration of purchased intangible assets from certain acquisitions into our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement by tax effects of sharebased compensation by costs related to intercompany restructurings or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations thereof further as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities including one of our manufacturing facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of 

  

the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition likewise events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax part of this portfolio includes equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if the public equities market declines we may recognize in earnings the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments below the cost basis when the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in our 2007 annual report to shareholders which section is incorporated by reference into this report our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with whom we work to offer complementary products and services these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however these alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 

we are required to recognize expense for sharebased compensation related to employee sharebased awards and there is no assurance that the expense that we are required to recognize measures accurately the value of our sharebased payment awards and the recognition of this expense could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

on july 31 2005 we adopted sfas 123r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased compensation based on estimated fair values as a result starting with fiscal 2006 our operating results contain a charge for employee sharebased compensation expense this charge is in addition to sharebased compensation expense we recognized prior to fiscal 2006 related to acquisitions and investments the application of sfas 123r requires the use of an optionpricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased payment awards this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors optionpricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value in management’s opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas 123r and sab 107 using an optionpricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyerwilling seller market transaction 

as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r beginning with fiscal 2006 our earnings were lower than they would have been had we not been required to adopt sfas 123r this will continue to be the case for future periods we cannot predict the effect that this adverse impact on our reported operating results will have on the trading price of our common stock 

  

our stock price may be volatile 

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

we have issued 65 billion of senior unsecured notes and there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected 

on february 22 2006 we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 65 billion that mature at specific dates in 2009 2011 and 2016 the notes that mature in 2009 bear floatingrate interest payable quarterly while the notes that mature in 2011 and 2016 bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually we have entered into certain interest rate swaps to in effect convert the interest rates of the fixed interest notes into floatingrates based on libor higher shortterm interest rates would accordingly result in increased interest expense while we presently mitigate this risk by investing a portion of our interestbearing assets in instruments with similar interest rate characteristics as the swapped debt there can be no assurance that we will maintain a matched portfolio in the future the instruments governing the notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions we have not previously undertaken substantial amounts of debt for borrowed money there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we and other defendants were subject to patent claims asserted by qpsx developments 5 pty ltd now known as ipernica ltd against us and such other defendants on june 21 2005 in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas qpsx alleged that various cisco switches and routers infringed united states patent no 5689499 and sought damages and injunctive relief on april 10 2007 prior to trial we and qpsx settled our dispute on terms that are not material to us and the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice on may 2 2007 

we and other defendants were subject to claims asserted by telcordia technologies inc on july 16 2004 in the federal district court for the district of delaware alleging that various cisco routers switches and optical products infringed united states patent nos 4893306 4835763 and re 36633 telcordia sought damages and injunctive relief the court ruled that as a matter of law we do not infringe patent no 4893306 after conclusion of a trial on may 10 2007 a jury found that infringement had occurred and awarded damages in an amount that is not material to us we have asked the court to reverse the verdict as a matter of law and if necessary we intend to appeal the decision telcordia has asked the court to enhance damages and award it attorneys’ fees and also has the right to appeal we believe that the ultimate outcome of this matter and aggregate potential damages will not be material 

in september 2005 scientificatlanta inc which subsequently was acquired by us and another plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action against forgent networks in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas after forgent sued various scientificatlanta customers in the action scientificatlanta asserted that its products did not infringe forgent’s united states patent no 6285746 and that the patent was invalid on october 20 2005 forgent responded to the complaint and alleged that various scientificatlanta digital video recorders infringed the patent and sought damages and injunctive relief subsequent to that another declaratory judgment plaintiff moved to intervene and the cases were combined on april 25 2007 prior to trial scientificatlanta and forgent settled their dispute on terms that are not material to us and the lawsuits were dismissed with prejudice on april 30 2007 

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including intellectual property litigation while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for additional information regarding intellectual property litigation see “part i item 1a risk factors—we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” herein

customers and markets 

  

our customers’ networking needs are influenced by numerous factors including the size of the organization number and types of computer systems geographic location and the applications requiring communications our customer base is not concentrated in any particular industry geography or market segment in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales our customers are primarily in the following markets 

  

large enterprise businesses 

  

we define large enterprise businesses generally as regional national or global organizations with 1000 or more employees working in multiple locations or branch offices they have complex it infrastructures and networking needs within a multivendor environment our large enterprise customers include government education and healthcare organizations and retail finance manufacturing and transportation entities we create and deliver routing switching network security unified communications mobility storage and other products and services in collaboration with thirdparty application and hardware vendors and channel partners we also offer a wide variety of services including service and support packages financing and managed network service offerings through our service provider partners 

  

service providers 

  

service providers offer data voice and video communication services to businesses governments utilities and consumers they include regional national and international telecommunications carriers as well as internet cable and wireless service providers service providers use a variety of our routing switching optical storage security video systems and network management products in their own core networks compared to other enduser customers service provider customers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services due to the scale and complexity of their networks additionally many service providers offer managed network services incorporating our products for their residential enterprise and commercial customers 

  

commercial 

  

we define commercial customers primarily as small and mediumsized businesses having fewer than 1000 employees and a need for networks of their own as well as for connections to the internet and to business partners smaller organizations generally have limited resources and expertise in networking technology therefore we attempt to provide products that are affordable and easy to install and use the commercial market remains an area of potential growth for network adoption and deployment of intelligent networking 

  

consumer 

  

consumer customers primarily individuals and businesses operating in small offices or home offices have infrastructure and networking needs on a smaller scale 

  

sales overview 

  

as of the end of fiscal 2006 our worldwide sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 17000 individuals including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in more than 70 countries and sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our sales force a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners 

  

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution a number of service providers are also systems integrators 

  

distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition linksys home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms which allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

  

for information regarding risks related to our channels please see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins” 

  

for information regarding risks relating to our international operations please see “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment” “due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our costs expenses and financial condition” “we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows” and “manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

  

our service offerings complement our products via a range of consulting technical project quality and maintenance services including 24hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers we facilitate and provide lease and other financing through our wholly owned subsidiaries to certain qualified customers for the purchase of equipment and other needs for additional information regarding these financing activities see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2006 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated into this report by reference 

  

backlog 

  

our backlog at july 29 2006 the last day of our 2006 fiscal year was approximately 30 billion compared with backlog of approximately 20 billion at july 30 2005 the last day of our 2005 fiscal year scientificatlanta contributed approximately 400 million of the backlog at july 29 2006 backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 

  

acquisitions investments and alliances 

  

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services through acquisitions investments and alliances we are able to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets 

  

we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking products and services we develop new technologies and products internally we enter into jointdevelopment efforts with other companies we resell other companies’ products and we acquire all or parts of other companies 

  

acquisitions 

  

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions for example we acquired scientificatlanta in february 2006 for a total purchase price of approximately 71 billion mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

  

investments in privately held companies 

  

we make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “item 1a risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

  

strategic alliances 

  

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with accenture ltd att corp bearingpoint inc cap gemini sa electronic data systems corporation emc corporation ericsson fujitsu limited hewlettpackard company intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa microsoft corporation motorola inc siemens ag and sprint nextel corporation among others 

  

competition 

  

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets as we continue to expand our sales globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially china and we anticipate this will continue 

  

our competitors include 3com alcatel avaya avici systems brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ciena dlink corporation dell enterasys networks extreme networks f5 networks inc force10 networks inc foundry networks fujitsu hewlettpackard company huawei technologies juniper networks lucent technologies mcdata corporation motorola inc netgear inc nokia nortel networks redback networks siemens ag sycamore networks and symbol technologies inc among others 

  

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas 

  

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we also face competition from customers to whom we license or supply technology and suppliers from whom we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

  

research and development 

  

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features in areas including routers switches advanced technologies and other product technologies our research and development expenditures were 41 billion 33 billion and 32 billion in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively all of our expenditures for research and development costs as well as inprocess research and development of 91 million 26 million and 3 million in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively have been expensed as incurred 

  

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including 

  

universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge still there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that such products will achieve market acceptance 

  

manufacturing 

  

we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services although we continue to operate scientificatlanta’s manufacturing facilities including its principal facility in juarez mexico scientificatlanta’s manufacturing operations range from automated assembly lines for volume production to complete assembly of a particular product by one individual or small group of individuals our remaining manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of materials and components subassemblies final assembly and testing of products we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printed circuit board assembly incircuit test and product repair as well as product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is installed in our systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements we also use automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls that are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to iso 9001 or iso 9003 standards 

  

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property during fiscal 2006 we began a transition to what we refer to as a lean manufacturing model lean manufacturing is an industrystandard model that seeks to drive efficiency and flexibility in manufacturing processes and in the broader supply chain over time consistent with what we have experienced thus far we expect this process will result in incremental increases in purchase commitments with corresponding decreases in core manufacturing inventory 

  

we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

  

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

  

economic conditions worldwide have contributed to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries and may impact our business resulting in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including terrorist activities and military actions particularly the continuing tension in and surrounding iraq and changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

  

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as leading to additional costs arising out of inventory management in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which we and our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

  

in addition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to attempt to improve our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers in the past to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively 

  

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

  

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

  

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

  

our level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

  

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

  

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

  

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally 

  

given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

  

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

  

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 

  

   

   

   

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

  

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

  

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

  

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and often sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain of our advanced technologies in addition to longer sales cycles we have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers as market conditions have changed sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations although some service providers may be increasing capital expenditures over the depressed levels that have prevailed over the last few years weakness in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition slowdowns in the general economy overcapacity changes in the service provider market regulatory developments and constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers with many of these customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion 

  

plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results and we expect that some or all of these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of service including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

  

a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

  

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts especially if the economy grows growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

  

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future 

  

   

   

   

manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints including those caused by any possible disruption related to our implementation of lean manufacturing could be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing leadtime performance and to help assure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2006 annual report to shareholders 

  

a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease 

  

the fact that we do not own the bulk of our manufacturing facilities could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our operating results financial problems of contract manufacturers on whom we rely or reservation of manufacturing capacity by other companies inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase costs 

  

our key manufacturing facilities for scientificatlanta’s products are located in juarez mexico and we may be materially and adversely affected by any prolonged disruption in the operation of this facility 

  

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our revenue growth 

  

for information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 of this report 

  

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

  

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe that the internet and the various networks associated with it including corporate intranets cable broadband and dialup networks and voice and video networks will evolve to include embedded resources and the virtualization of applications and services to produce an integrated intelligent system or as we refer to it an intelligent information network this is our vision for the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that an intelligent information network would demand the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems does not emerge as we believe it will many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share net sales and earnings the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive specifically the products and technologies that we identify as “emerging technologies” or “advanced technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or advanced technologies 

  

we are increasing our investment in engineering and sales activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

  

we intend to continue to add personnel and other resources to both our engineering and sales functions as we focus on developing emerging technologies the next wave of advanced technologies growing the commercial market segment capitalizing on our emerging market opportunities enhancing our evolving support model and increasing our market share gains we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

  

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on the continued growth of the internet to the extent that an economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

  

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be certain performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

  

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

  

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

  

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

  

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

acquisitions may also cause us to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

  

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in inprocess research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings in addition our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factors above including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

  

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

  

as we focus on new market opportunities—for example storage wireless security and transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network—we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications 

  

equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past demand for these types of service or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities further provision of greater levels of services by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets including our entry into the consumer market has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

  

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

  

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins in the past we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped although the cost of such remediation has not been material in the past there can be no assurance that such a remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on our revenue margins and net income 

  

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

  

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

  

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our costs expenses and financial condition 

  

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states maintain a manufacturing facility for a substantial portion of our video systems products in juarez mexico and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers and our distribution partners for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 we derived approximately 475 and 488 respectively of our net sales from sales outside the united states accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates political or social unrest economic instability or natural disasters in a specific country or region environmental and trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import our products to export our products from or sell our products in various countries such as the restriction of hazardous substances directive rohs adopted in february 2003 by the european union and subsequently by certain other countries political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns health or 

  

similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our costs expenses and financial condition 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

  

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

  

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

  

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

  

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services and for working capital purposes we do not recognize revenue on customer loan financing arrangements until cash payments are received 

  

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if there is an economic slowdown although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations 

  

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

  

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

  

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

  

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

  

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the 

  

need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

  

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

  

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales taxes on internet product sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

  

changes in telecommunications requirements in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

  

future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various federal communications commission requirements and regulations in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

  

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock option grants are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the adoption of sfas 123r or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees as a result of one or more of these factors we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the united states which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

  

adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition 

  

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to 

  

predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof further as a result of certain ongoing employment and capital investment commitments made by us our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates and in some cases is wholly exempt from tax our failure to meet such commitments could adversely impact our effective tax rate in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

  

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities including one of our manufacturing facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake a hurricane or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

  

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition similarly events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax part of this portfolio includes equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if the public equities market 

  

declines we may recognize in earnings the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments below the cost basis when the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in our 2006 annual report to shareholders which section is incorporated by reference into this report our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

  

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

  

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with whom we work to offer complementary products and services these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however these alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 

  

we are required to recognize expense for stockbased compensation related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases and there is no assurance that the expense that we are required to recognize measures accurately the value of our sharebased payment awards and the recognition of this expense could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

  

on july 31 2005 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas 123r” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stockbased compensation based on estimated fair values as a result starting with fiscal 2006 our operating results contain a charge for stockbased compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases this charge is in addition to stockbased compensation expense we have recognized in prior periods related to acquisitions and investments the application of sfas 123r requires the use of an optionpricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased payment awards this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors optionpricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value in management’s opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas 123r and sab 107 using an optionpricing model that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyerwilling seller market transaction 

  

as a result of the adoption of sfas 123r beginning with fiscal 2006 our earnings were lower than they would have been had we not been required to adopt sfas 123r this will continue to be the case for future periods we cannot predict the effect that this adverse impact on our reported operating results will have on the trading price of our common stock 

  

our stock price may be volatile 

  

historically our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions or any difficulties associated with such transactions by us or our current or potential competitors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price 

  

we have issued 65 billion of senior unsecured notes and there can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected 

  

on february 22 2006 we issued senior unsecured notes in an aggregate principal amount of 65 billion that mature at specific dates in 2009 2011 and 2016 the notes that mature in 2009 bear floatingrate interest payable quarterly while the notes that mature in 2011 and 2016 bear fixedrate interest payable semiannually we have entered into certain interest rate swaps to in effect convert the interest rates of the fixed interest notes into floatingrates based on the london interbank offered rate libor higher shortterm interest rates would accordingly result in increased interest expense while we presently mitigate this risk by investing a portion of our interestbearing assets in instruments with similar interest rate characteristics as the swapped debt there can be no assurance that we will maintain a matched portfolio in the future the instruments governing the notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions we have not previously undertaken substantial amounts of debt for borrowed money there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources including cash currently held offshore further we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition in addition changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities

 item 3 legal proceedings

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including intellectual property litigation while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for additional information regarding intellectual property litigation please see “item 1a risk factors—we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” herein

service providers offer data voice and video communication services to businesses governments utilities and consumers they include regional national and international telecommunications carriers as well as internet cable and wireless service providers service providers use a variety of our routing switching optical storage security and network management products in their own core networks compared to other enduser customers service provider customers are more likely to require network design deployment and support services additionally many service providers offer managed network services incorporating our products for their residential enterprise and commercial customers 

  

commercial 

  

we define commercial customers primarily as small and mediumsized businesses having fewer than 1000 employees and a need for networks of their own as well as for connections to the internet and to business partners smaller organizations generally have limited resources and expertise in networking technology therefore we attempt to provide products that are affordable and easy to install and use the commercial market remains an area of potential growth for network adoption and deployment of intelligent network 

  

consumer 

  

consumer customers primarily individuals and businesses operating in small offices or home offices have infrastructure and networking needs on a smaller scale we offer products to consumers through our linksys division 

  

sales overview 

  

as of the end of fiscal 2005 our worldwide sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 14000 individuals including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in more than 60 countries and sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our sales force a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners 

  

systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators 

  

distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition our linksys division home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms which allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

  

for information regarding risks related to our channels please see the section of this report entitled “risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins”

we facilitate and provide lease and other financing through our wholly owned subsidiaries to certain qualified customers for the purchase of equipment and other needs for additional information regarding these financing activities see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2005 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated into this report by reference 

  

acquisitions investments and alliances 

  

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all the technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services through acquisitions investments and alliances we are able to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets 

  

we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking products and services we develop new technologies and products internally we enter into jointdevelopment efforts with other companies we resell other companies’ products and we acquire all or parts of other companies 

  

acquisitions 

  

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in the section of this report entitled “risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

  

investments in privately held companies 

  

in addition to passive portfolio investments we make minority investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in the section of the report entitled “risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

  

strategic alliances 

  

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with accenture ltd att corp bearingpoint inc bell south corporation cap gemini sa electronic data systems corporation ericsson fujitsu limited hewlettpackard company intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa microsoft corporation motorola inc sbc communications inc siemens ag and sprint corporation among others 

  

backlog 

  

our backlog at july 30 2005 the last day of our 2005 fiscal year was approximately 20 billion compared with backlog of approximately 19 billion at july 31 2004 the last day of our 2004 fiscal year backlog 

  

includes orders confirmed with a purchase order for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets as we continue to expand our sales globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we are seeing pricefocused competitors from asia especially china and we anticipate this will continue 

  

our competitors include 3com alcatel avaya avici systems brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ciena dlink corporation dell enterasys networks extreme networks f5 networks inc force10 networks inc foundry networks fujitsu hewlettpackard company huawei technologies juniper networks lucent technologies mcdata corporation netgear inc nokia nortel networks redback networks siemens ag sycamore networks and symbol technologies inc among others 

  

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area 

  

barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products companies with whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas 

  

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we also face competition from customers to whom we license or supply technology and suppliers from whom we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers suppliers and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

  

research and development 

  

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features in areas including routers switches advanced technologies and other product technologies our research and development expenditures were 33 billion 32 billion and 31 billion in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively all of our expenditures for research and development costs as well as inprocess research and development of 26 million 3 million and 4 million in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively have been expensed as incurred 

  

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success depends in part upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership in order to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge still there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that such products will achieve market acceptance 

  

manufacturing 

  

we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services our manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of materials and components subassemblies final assembly and testing of products we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printed circuit board assembly incircuit test and product repair as well as product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is installed in our systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements we also use automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls that are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally iso 9001 or iso 9003 certified 

  

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

  




 risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

  

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment 

  

economic conditions worldwide have contributed to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries and may impact our business resulting in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including terrorist activities and military actions particularly the continuing tension in and surrounding iraq and changes in energy costs may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results 

  

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or may decline our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred as well as leading to additional costs arising out of inventory management in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods in which we and our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter 

  

in addition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to attempt to improve our manufacturing leadtime performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers in the past to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively 

  

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short term business changes 

  

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

  

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

  

our recent level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods 

  

disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins 

  

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected 

  

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include systems integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to endusers and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also systems integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators service providers and other resellers in addition with the acquisition of the linksys business home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing 

  

programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a degree the timing of orders from our customers 

  

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

  

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model which could harm our sales and margins including the following 

  

   

   

   

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

  

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand revenue to our distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

  

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

  

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and often sporadic purchases especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain of our advanced technologies in addition to longer sales cycles we have experienced significant weakness in sales to service providers as market conditions have changed sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations although some service providers may be increasing capital expenditures over the depressed levels that have prevailed over the last few years weakness in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition slowdowns in the general economy overcapacity changes in the service provider market regulatory developments and constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers with many of these customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results and we expect that some or all of these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future finally service provider customers typically have 

  

longer implementation cycles require a broader range of service including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

  

a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

  

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues that have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts especially if the economy grows growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

  

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future 

  

   

   

   

manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing lead time performance and to help assure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2005 annual report to shareholders a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for products could materially 

  

adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease 

  

the fact that we do not own the bulk of our manufacturing facilities could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on operating results financial problems of contract manufacturers on whom we rely or reservation of manufacturing capacity by other companies inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase costs 

  

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our revenue growth 

  

for information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 of this report 

  

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

  

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe that the internet and the various networks associated with it including corporate intranets cable broadband and dialup networks and voice and video networks will evolve to include embedded resources and the virtualization of applications and services to produce an integrated intelligent system or as we refer to it an intelligent information network this is our vision for the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that an intelligent information network would demand the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems does not emerge as we believe it will many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share net sales and earnings the success of new products depends on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive specifically the products and technologies that we identify as “advanced technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other advanced technologies 

  

we are increasing our investment in engineering and sales activities and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits which could harm our operating results 

  

we intend to continue to add personnel and other resources to both our engineering and sales functions as we focus on developing the next wave of advanced technologies growing the commercial market segment capitalizing on our emerging market opportunities and increasing our market share gains we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

  

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on the continued growth of the internet to the extent that an economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

  

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be certain performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility because we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

  

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

  

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technologyrelated writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 

  

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

  

our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

acquisitions may also cause us to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

  

from time to time we have made acquisitions that resulted in inprocess research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factor above entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

  

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

  

as we focus on new market opportunities—for example storage wireless security and transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network—we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past demand for these types of service or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities further provision of greater levels of services by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets including our recent entry into the consumer market has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

  

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue gross margins and net income 

  

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins in the past we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped although the cost of such remediation has not been material in the past there can be no assurance that such a remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on revenue margins and net income 

  

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

  

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

  

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our costs expenses and financial condition 

  

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers and our distribution partners for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 we derived 488 and 493 of our net sales respectively from sales outside the united states accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates political or social unrest economic instability or natural disasters in a specific country or region environmental and trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import our products to export our products from or sell our products in various countries political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns health or similar issues such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in asia difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our costs expenses and financial condition 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

  

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have 

  

extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

  

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

  

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

  

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services and for working capital purposes we do not recognize revenue on structured loan financing arrangements until cash payments are received 

  

our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if there is an economic slowdown although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations 

  

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

  

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states although we are not 

  

dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

  

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

  

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

  

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

  

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

  

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption 

  

technology sales taxes on internet product sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

  

changes in telecommunications requirements in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various federal communications commission requirements and regulations in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

  

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock option grants are designed to reward employees for their longterm contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom have been granted stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

  

adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition 

  

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations accounting principles or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous 

  

examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

in july 2005 the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation “accounting for uncertain tax positions—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” the proposed interpretation proposes changes to the current accounting for uncertain tax positions while we cannot predict with certainty the rules in the final interpretation there is risk that the final interpretation could result in a cumulative effect charge to earnings upon adoption increases in future effective tax rates andor increases in future interperiod effective tax rate volatility 

  

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

  

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities including one of our manufacturing facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

  

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition efforts to limit the ability of malicious third parties to disrupt the operations of the internet or undermine our own security efforts may meet with resistance in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition similarly events such as widespread blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax part of this portfolio includes equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility to the extent unhedged if there is an economic slowdown which adversely affects the public equities market we may recognize in earnings the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments below the cost basis when the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” included in our 2005 annual report to shareholders which section is incorporated by reference into this report our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

  

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

  

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with whom we work to offer complementary products and services these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however these alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 

  

our stock price may continue to be volatile 

  

our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business security of our products or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

beginning on april 20 2001 a number of purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against cisco and certain of our officers and directors the lawsuits have been consolidated and the consolidated action is purportedly brought on behalf of those who purchased our publicly traded securities between august 10 1999 and february 6 2001 plaintiffs allege that defendants have made false and misleading statements purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for liability due to the uncertainty surrounding the litigation process we are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss if any at this time 

  

beginning on april 23 2001 a number of purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the superior court of california county of santa clara in the superior court of california county of san mateo and in the united states district court for the northern district of california these actions were later consolidated the complaints included claims for breach of fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets mismanagement unjust enrichment and violations of the california corporations code sought compensatory damages disgorgement and other relief and were based on essentially the same allegations as the class actions on march 22 2005 the superior court approved a comprehensive settlement of all of these derivative claims which provided for dismissal with prejudice of all of plaintiffs’ claims reimbursement of a portion of plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and agreement to maintain certain of our policies and consider others 

  

on february 16 2005 a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the superior court of california county of santa clara against various of our officers and directors and naming us as a nominal defendant the lawsuit includes claims for breach of fiduciary duty unjust enrichment constructive trust and violations of the california corporations code is based upon allegations of wrongdoing in connection with option grants and compensation to officers and directors the timing of option grants and our share repurchase plan and seeks unspecified compensation and other damages rescission of options and other relief 

  

in addition we were subject to patent claims asserted by storage technology corporation against us on december 10 1999 claims related to one patent were dismissed and a trial relating to claims related to a second patent commenced may 19 2005 in the federal district court for the northern district of california the claims which were the subject of the trial included an assertion that netflow feature acceleration infringed united states patent no 5842040 and included demands for damages and injunctive relief on june 7 2005 the court entered judgment in our favor when the jury returned a verdict finding no infringement by us and that the patent claims at issue in the case were invalid 

  

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business including intellectual property litigation while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows for additional information regarding intellectual property litigation see “risk factors—we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” herein

over time we believe that the internet and the various networks associated with it including corporate intranets cable broadband and dialup networks and voice and video networks will evolve to include embedded resources and the virtualization of applications and services to produce an integrated intelligent system or as we refer to it an intelligent information network this is our vision for the 

  

evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems in this evolving environment we believe successful vendors will be capable of providing a broad spectrum of products aimed not at a particular technology platform but at solutions to networking problems that span all segments as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that an intelligent information network would demand for a discussion of the risks associated with that strategy please see the section of this report entitled “risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for information regarding sales of our major products and services see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2004 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated into this report by reference

consumer customers primarily individuals and small officehome office soho businesses have infrastructure and networking needs on a smaller scale we offer products to consumers through our linksys division 

  

sales overview 

  

as of the end of fiscal 2004 our worldwide sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately 13000 individuals including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel we have field sales offices in more than 60 countries and sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our sales force a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include system integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners 

  

system integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales system integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution and a number of service providers are also system integrators 

  

distributors stock inventory and typically sell to system integrators service providers and other resellers in addition with the acquisition of the linksys business home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms which allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs 

  

for information regarding risks related to our channels please see the section of this report entitled “risk factors” including the risk factors entitled “disruption of or changes in our distribution model or customer base could harm our sales and margins” and “our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins”

acquisitions investments and alliances 

  

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological 

  

complexity and rapid change within our markets makes it difficult for a single company to develop all technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of products and services through acquisitions investments and alliances we are able to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets 

  

we employ the following strategies to address the need for new or enhanced networking products and solutions we develop new technologies and products internally we enter into jointdevelopment efforts with other companies we resell other companies’ products and we acquire all or parts of other companies 

  

acquisitions 

  

we have acquired many companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if the acquired company has yet to ship a product no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in the section of this report entitled “risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

  

investments in privately held companies 

  

in addition to passive portfolio investments we make minority investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or provide strategic value the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in the section of the report entitled “risk factors” including the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

  

strategic alliances 

  

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product and solution development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with att corp bearingpoint inc bell south corporation cap gemini sa electronic data systems corporation hewlettpackard company intel corporation international business machines corporation italtel spa microsoft corporation motorola inc sbc communications inc and sprint corporation among others 

  

backlog 

  

our backlog at july 31 2004 the last day of our 2004 fiscal year was approximately 19 billion compared with backlog of approximately 20 billion at july 26 2003 the last day of our 2003 fiscal year backlog includes orders confirmed with a purchase order for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets as we continue to expand our sales globally we may see new competitors in different geographic regions especially asia 

  

our competitors include 3com alcatel avaya avici systems brocade communications systems inc check point software technologies ciena dlink systems inc dell enterasys networks extreme networks force10 networks inc foundry networks fujitsu hewlettpackard company huawei technologies juniper networks lucent mcdata corporation netgear inc nokia nortel networks redback networks siemens ag and sycamore networks among others 

  

some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area 

  

barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition some of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products 

  

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we also face competition from customers to whom we license or supply technology and suppliers from whom we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

  

research and development 

  

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features in areas including routers switches advanced technologies and other product technologies 

  

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success in part depends upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership in order to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge still there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that such products will achieve market acceptance 

  

our research and development expenditures were 32 billion 31 billion and 34 billion in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively all of our expenditures for research and development costs as well as inprocess research and development of 3 million 4 million and 65 million in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively have been expensed as incurred 

  

manufacturing 

  

we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services our manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of materials and components subassemblies final assembly and testing of products we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printed circuit board assembly incircuit test and product repair as well as product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is installed in our systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements we also use automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls that are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally iso 9001 or iso 9003 certified 

  

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an asneeded basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

  




 risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

  

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by the uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions 

  

economic conditions worldwide have contributed to recent slowdowns in the communications and networking industries and may continue to impact our business resulting in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including terrorist activities and military actions particularly the continuing tension in and surrounding iraq may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate we may experience material impacts on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our revenues for a particular period are difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results 

  

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenues for a particular quarter are difficult to predict our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods and may decline our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns in addition to making it difficult to predict revenues for a particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs as irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods when overtime expenses may be incurred as well as leading to additional costs arising out of inventory management in addition to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future and particularly in periods when we and our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity it is possible that revenues for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters are not remediated within the same quarter 

  

in addition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to attempt to improve our manufacturing lead time performance which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers in the past to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively 

  

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the short term a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations as we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short term business changes 

  

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

  

we expect gross margin to vary over time and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

  

our recent level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals 

  

disruption of or changes in our distribution model or customer base could harm our sales and margins 

  

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected furthermore a change in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise or a change in the mix of direct and indirect sales could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 

  

a substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners and the remainder is sold through direct sales our channel partners include system integrators service providers other resellers distributors and retail partners system integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation technical support professional services and other support services in addition to network equipment sales system integrators also typically integrate our products into an 

  

overall solution and a number of service providers are also system integrators distributors stock inventory and typically sell to system integrators service providers and other resellers in addition with the acquisition of the linksys business home networking products are generally sold through distributors and retail partners we refer to sales through distributors and retail partners as our twotier system of sales to the end customer revenue from distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms which allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a certain degree the timing of orders from our customers 

  

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

  

some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model or customer base which could harm our sales and margins including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

our inventory management relating to our sales to our twotier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

  

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors and retail partners effectively because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations our distributors and retail partners may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products they also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end user demand revenue to our distributors and retail partners is recognized based on a sellthrough method using information provided by them and they are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing programs in addition due to the expansion of our product line breadth and continued need for higher inventory levels of certain subassemblies of highdemand products in order to manage customer lead times our inventory levels have increased in recent periods we may continue to see these higher inventories in the shorter term inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and writedown inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

  

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and continued declines or delays in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

  

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and often sporadic purchases with longer sales cycles we have experienced significant decreases in sales to service providers as market conditions have changed sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent that service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations although some service providers may be increasing capital expenditures over the depressed levels that have prevailed over the last few years continued declines or delays in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the recent slowdown in the general economy overcapacity changes in the service provider market and constraints on capital availability 

  

have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers with many of such customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans these conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results and we expect that some or all of these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of service including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

  

a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margins 

  

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers we have experienced component shortages in the past including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues which have affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing process issues manufacturing process issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers capacity problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers or strong demand in the industry for those parts especially if the economy grows growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed our operating results would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more components than we need there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

  

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future 

  

   

   

   

manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant issues for us we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing lead time performance and to help assure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements in certain instances these agreements allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2004 annual report to shareholders a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers a failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs or a decrease in demand for products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used our gross margins could decrease 

  

the fact that we do not own the bulk of our manufacturing facilities could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on operating results financial problems of contract manufacturers on whom we rely or reservation of manufacturing capacity by other companies inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase costs 

  

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our revenue growth 

  

for information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 of this report 

  

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

  

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe that the internet and the various networks associated with it including corporate intranets cable broadband and dialup networks voice and video networks will evolve to include embedded resources and the virtualization of applications and services to produce an integrated intelligent system or as we refer to it an intelligent information network this is our vision for the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems as such many of our strategic initiatives and investments are aimed at meeting the requirements that an intelligent information network would demand the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources to developing new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking from connectivity products to intelligent systems does not emerge as we believe it will many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenues and earnings the success of new products is dependent on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive specifically the products and technologies that we have identified as “advanced technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other advanced technologies 

  

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems 

  

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on the continued growth of the internet as a result of the recent economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending which have particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on internet infrastructure declined which has materially harmed our business to the extent that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could continue to experience material harm to our business operating results and financial condition 

  

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be certain performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility as we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

  

changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses and asset impairments 

  

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technology related writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess 

  

facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 

  

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

  

our growth is dependent upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

acquisitions may also cause us to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results prior acquisitions have 

  

resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

  

from time to time we have made acquisitions that result in inprocess research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings 

  

risks related to new product development also apply to acquisitions please see the risk factor above entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information 

  

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

  

as we focus on new market opportunities—for example storage wireless security and transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network—we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past demand for these types of service or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities further provision of greater levels of services by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition entry into other markets including our recent entry into the consumer market has subjected and will subject us to additional risks particularly to those markets including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

  

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenues gross margins and net income 

  

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins in the past we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped while the cost of such remediation has not been material in the past there can be no assurance that such a remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on revenues margins and net income 

  

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

  

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

  

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our costs expenses and financial condition 

  

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers and our distribution partners for fiscal 2004 we derived 493 of our revenues from sales outside the united states accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns health or similar issues such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in asia difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our costs expenses and financial condition 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

  

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

  

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

  

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

  

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services and for working capital purposes we do not recognize revenue on structured loan financing arrangements until cash payments are received 

  

because of the recent slowdown in the global economy our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

a portion of our sales is derived through our distributors and retail partners these distributors and retail partners are generally given business terms which allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms however distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations 

  

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

  

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products while we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our rights will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states while we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create the innovative products that have enabled us to be successful 

  

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

  

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

  

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

  

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

  

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sales taxes on internet product sales and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

  

changes in telecommunications requirements in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various federal communications commission requirements and regulations in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

  

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel in spite of the recent economic slowdown competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees virtually all of whom have been granted stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

  

adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition 

  

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

  

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities including one of our manufacturing facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

  

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business operating results and financial condition similarly events such as the blackouts in the eastern united states and recurrences of these blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as availableforsale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax part of this portfolio includes equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility the recent economic downturn and other factors have adversely affected the public equities market and general economic conditions may worsen as a result we may recognize in earnings the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments below the cost basis when the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in our 2004 annual report to 

  

shareholders which is incorporated by reference in item 7a of this report our investments in private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky as the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

  

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

  

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with whom we work to offer complementary products and services these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however these alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 

  

our stock price may continue to be volatile 

  

our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

beginning on april 20 2001 a number of purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against us and certain of our officers and directors the lawsuits have been consolidated and the consolidated action is purportedly brought on behalf of those who purchased our publicly traded securities between august 10 1999 and february 6 2001 plaintiffs allege that defendants made false and misleading statements purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously 

  

in addition beginning on april 23 2001 a number of purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the superior court of california county of santa clara and in the superior court of california county of san mateo there is a procedure in place for the coordination of such actions one of which has been dismissed and is currently on appeal two purported derivative suits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california and those federal court actions have been consolidated the consolidated federal court derivative action was dismissed by the court and plaintiffs have appealed from that decision the complaints in the various derivative actions include claims for breach of fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets mismanagement unjust enrichment and violations of the california corporations code seek compensatory and other damages disgorgement and other relief and are based on essentially the same allegations as the class actions 

  

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

acquisitions investments and alliances 

  

the markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of technological complexity and rapid change within our markets make it difficult for a single company to develop all technological solutions that it desires to offer within its family of product and services through acquisitions investments and alliances we are able to deliver a broader range of products and services to customers in target markets 

  

we employ the following strategies to satisfy the need for new or enhanced networking products and solutions we develop new technologies and products internally we enter into jointdevelopment efforts with other companies we resell other companies’ products and we acquire all or part of other companies 

  

acquisitions 

  

since 1993 we have acquired several companies and we expect to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if no product has been shipped by the acquired company no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in the section of this report entitled “risk factors” including but not limited to the risk factor entitled “we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results” 

  

investments in privately held companies 

  

we make minority investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or provide strategic value by investing in new ventures we strengthen our relationships with such companies the risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in the section of the report entitled “risk factors” including but not limited to the risk factor entitled “we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings” 

  

strategic alliances 

  

we pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product and solution development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently we have strategic alliances with att bearingpoint bell south cap geminiernst  young eds hewlettpackard ibm intel italtel microsoft motorola sbc and sprint among others 

  

backlog 

  

our backlog at july 26 2003 was approximately 20 billion compared with a backlog of approximately 23 billion at july 27 2002 our backlog at september 8 2003 was approximately 16 billion compared with a backlog of approximately 14 billion at september 9 2002 backlog includes orders confirmed with a purchase order for products scheduled to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty we do not believe that our backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period 

  

competition 

  

we compete in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet these markets are characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us we compete with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase also the composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our advanced technology markets 

  

our competitors include 3com alcatel avaya avici check point software ciena dell ericsson enterasys extreme networks foundry networks fujitsu huawei juniper lucent netscreen nokia nortel networks redback networks riverstone siemens ag and sycamore networks among others some of these companies compete across many of our product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed in addition several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but from other competitors as well including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products 

  

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we also face competition from customers to whom we license or supply technology and suppliers from whom we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success 

  

research and development 

  

we regularly seek to introduce new products and features in areas including among others data voice and video over ip advanced access and aggregation technologies such as cable wireless and other broadband technologies advanced enterprise switching optical transport storage networking content networking security network management and advanced core and edge routing technologies 

  

the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result our success in part depends upon our ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership in order to achieve these objectives our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations we also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate to provide us with access to new technologies we intend to continue developing products that meet key industry standards and to support important protocol standards as they emerge still there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that such products will achieve market acceptance 

  

our research and development expenditures were 31 billion 34 billion and 39 billion in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively all of our expenditures for research and development costs as well as inprocess research and development of 4 million 65 million and 855 million in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively have been expensed as incurred 

  

manufacturing 

  

we primarily employ an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services our manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of materials and components subassemblies final assembly and testing of products we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printed circuit board assembly incircuit test and product repair as well as product assembly proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is installed in our systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements we also use automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection 

  

testing and statistical process control that are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products the manufacturing processes and procedures are generally iso 9001 or iso 9003 certified 

  

our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality cost and delivery requirements as well as manufacturing process terms such as continuity of supply inventory management flexibility regarding capacity quality and cost management oversight of manufacturing and conditions for use of our intellectual property we have not entered into any significant longterm contracts with any manufacturing service provider we generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as needed basis primarily annually these arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond certain amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time 

  




 risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report 

  

our operating results may fluctuate in future periods which may adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of a number of factors these factors include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price 

  

our operating results may be adversely affected by the uncertain geopolitical environment and unfavorable economic and market conditions 

  

adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries and may continue to impact our business resulting in 

  

   

   

   

   

   

recent turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world including terrorist activities and military actions particularly the aftermath of the war in iraq may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate further we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise we do not expect the trend of lower capital spending among service providers to reverse itself in the near term 

  

our revenues for a particular period are difficult to predict and a shortfall in revenues may harm our operating results 

  

as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenues for a particular quarter are difficult to predict our net sales may grow at a slower rate than in past periods and in particular periods may decline our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time during which shipments exceeded net bookings leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns this can increase costs as irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods when overtime expenses may be incurred as well as leading to additional costs arising out of inventory management 

  

in addition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to attempt to reduce our manufacturing lead times which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers in the past to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and cancel the duplicative orders when the product is received or place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively 

  

we plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the shortterm a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations as we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes 

  

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results 

  

we expect that gross margin variability and our recent level of product gross margin may not be sustainable 

  

although we have experienced increasing product gross margins our recent level of product gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including but not limited to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals 

  

disruption of or changes in the mix of our products and services distribution model or customer base could harm our sales and margins 

  

if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected furthermore a change in the mix of our customers between service provider and 

  

enterprise or a change in the mix of direct and indirect sales could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins 

  

we use a variety of channels to bring our products and services to our enduser customers including system integrators twotier distributors and direct sales system integrators integrate our products and services into an overall network solution that they typically resell to an end user twotier distributors stock inventory and sell to resellers who may themselves be system integrators direct sales occur to both enterprise accounts and service providers a substantial portion of our products and services is distributed through our channel partners and the remainder is distributed through direct sales if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a certain degree the timing of orders from our customers 

  

historically we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels although variability to date has not been significant because each distribution channel has a unique profile there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability 

  

for example 

  

   

   

   

   

our inventory management relating to our sales to distributors is complex and excess finished goods may harm our gross margins 

  

we must manage our inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively with respect to finished goods inventory held by our twotier distributors could affect our results of operations distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to the distributor and in response to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand 

  

if we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins our twotier distribution channels in contrast to our onetier distributors are given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we recognize revenue to twotier distributors based on a sellthrough method utilizing information provided by our distributors and we also maintain accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 

  

sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and continued declines or delays in sales orders from this industry may harm our operating results and financial condition 

  

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and often sporadic purchases with longer sales cycles although we continue to invest in development of new products aimed at this market segment we have experienced significant decreases in sales to service providers as market conditions have changed sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent that service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations continued declines or delays in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the slowdown in the general economy overcapacity changes in the service provider market and the constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers with numerous such customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans these conditions have had a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and we expect that these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future finally service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles require a broader range of service including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often require acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers 

  

a shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply that could adversely affect our gross margins 

  

our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers we have experienced component shortages in the past that have adversely affected our operations we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts or problems experienced by suppliers if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely 

  

manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales 

  

we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges going forward 

  

   

   

   

manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant issues for us we use several contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with certain contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in our 2003 annual report to shareholders a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually utilized our gross margins could decrease 

  

the fact that we do not own the bulk of our manufacturing facilities could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on operating results financial problems of contract manufacturers on whom we rely or reservation of manufacturing capacity by other companies inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase costs 

  

the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our revenue growth 

  

for information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 of this report 

  

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer 

  

the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products we believe the internet and other data voice and video networks are evolving into a “network of networks” which will require common technology platforms and broad endtoend solutions for particular applications rather than products aimed at particular market segments in that environment customers will be more concerned with overall solutions rather than with whether the solution is built around a particular technology such as routing or switching the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources to develop new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if the “network of networks” model does not emerge as we believe it will many of our investments may prove to be without value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion or a lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenues and earnings the success of new products is dependent on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive specifically the products and technologies that we have identified as “advanced technologies” may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other advanced technologies that will be important for our future success 

  

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses 

  

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of the internet as a result of the current economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending which have particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on internet infrastructure has declined which has had a material adverse effect on our business to the extent that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending on 

  

internet infrastructure we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be certain performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility as we are a large supplier of networking products our business operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business 

  

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technology related writeoffs workforce reduction costs charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions further our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 

  

we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

  

our growth is dependent upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies product lines technologies and personnel acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

acquisitions may also cause us to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products 

  

from time to time we have made acquisitions that result in inprocess research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings 

  

see also the discussion of risks related to new product development which also applies to acquisitions above under the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs our operating results and market share may suffer” 

  

entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations 

  

as we focus on new market opportunities such as storage wireless security transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past demand for these types of service or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities further provision of greater levels of services by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition in addition if we successfully move into other 

  

markets such as the consumer market we will be subject to additional risks associated with that market including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence 

  

product quality problems could lead to reduced revenues gross margins and net income 

  

we produce highly complex products that incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects—either in individual products or which could affect numerous shipments—which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins in the past we have had to recall certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of bugs in products that we had shipped while the cost of such recalls and remediation has not been material in the past there can be no assurance that such a recall or remediation depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market segment damage to our reputation inventory costs or product reengineering expenses any of which could have a material impact on revenues margins and net income 

  

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results 

  

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 

  

due to the global nature of our operations political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our costs expenses and financial condition 

  

we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers and our distribution partners for fiscal 2003 we derived 489 of our revenues from sales outside the united states accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our 

  

products from various countries political considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries in addition if the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in asia continues or recurs this could have an adverse impact on our asian operations if there is a significant spread of sars beyond asia other aspects of our operations could be negatively impacted any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our costs expenses and financial condition 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows 

  

because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 

  

currently we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the shortterm impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables in addition we periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 

  

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets which could result in material losses 

  

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with typical payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and 

  

integration of our products and services and for working capital purposes we do not recognize revenue on such loan financing arrangements until cash payments are received 

  

because of the current slowdown in the global economy our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above has increased although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

a portion of our sales is derived through our resellers in twotier distribution channels these resellerscustomers are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such exposures however such resellers tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations 

  

our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce 

  

we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products while we have been issued a number of patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that any rights granted under these patents will in fact provide competitive advantages to us furthermore many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards which are usable by all market entrants in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states the outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the united states while we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create the innovative products which have enabled us to be successful 

  

we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others 

  

third parties including customers have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical nor even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe or will infringe the patent rights of others the asserted claims andor initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all in all such circumstances or that our indemnification by their suppliers will be adequate to cover their costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers furthermore because of the potential for high court awards which are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant funds if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks further in the past third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition 

  

we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses 

  

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

  

our operating results and future prospects could be materially harmed by uncertainties of regulation of the internet 

  

currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol encryption technology and access charges for internet service providers the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our success largely depends on our ability to retain and recruit key personnel and any failure to do so would harm our ability to meet key objectives 

  

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel in spite of the economic slowdown competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees all of whom have been granted stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future 

  

adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition 

  

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report 

  

changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our 

  

deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

  

our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events 

  

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally a certain number of our facilities including one of our manufacturing facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 

  

despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to these economies and create further uncertainties similarly events such as the recent blackouts in the eastern united states and recurrences of these blackouts could have similar negative impacts to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates impairment of our investments could harm our earnings 

  

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax part of this portfolio includes equity investments in several publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility the current economic downturn and other factors have adversely affected the public equities market and general economic conditions may continue to worsen as a result we may 

  

recognize in earnings the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments below the cost basis when the decline is judged to be other than temporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates refer to the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” in our 2003 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference in item 7a of this report furthermore our equity investments in both publicly traded companies and private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 

  

if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances we may experience increased competition or delays in product development 

  

we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with whom we work to offer complementary products and services these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however these alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties 

  

changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs could harm our prospects and future sales 

  

changes in telecommunications requirements in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe that there may be future changes in us telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various federal communications commission requirements and regulations in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

  

our stock price may continue to be volatile 

  

our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and political conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future additionally volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees all of whom are compensated in part based on the performance of our stock price

 patents intellectual property and licensing 

  

we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate we also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements we have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the united states and in other countries there can be no assurance however that these patents are valid or can be enforced against competitive products in every jurisdiction although we believe the protection afforded by our patents patent applications copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws 

  

many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products we believe based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 

  

the industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us or that our rights will give us a competitive 

  

advantage in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in the section of this report entitled “risk factors” including but not limited to the risk factors entitled “our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce” “we may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” and “we rely on the availability of thirdparty licenses” 

  

employees 

  

as of july 26 2003 we had approximately 34000 employees including 6000 in manufacturing and service 12000 in engineering 13000 in sales and marketing and 3000 in finance and administration approximately 9000 employees are in locations outside the united states we consider the relationships with our employees to be positive competition for technical personnel in the industry in which we compete is intense we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date we believe that we have been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in the future 

  




 item 3   legal proceedings tableend   

beginning on april 20 2001 a number of purported shareholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against us and certain of our officers and directors the lawsuits have been consolidated and the consolidated action is purportedly brought on behalf of those who purchased our publicly traded securities between august 10 1999 and february 6 2001 plaintiffs allege that defendants have made false and misleading statements purport to assert claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief we believe the claims are without merit and intend to defend the actions vigorously 

  

in addition beginning on april 23 2001 a number of purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the superior court of california county of santa clara and in the superior court of california county of san mateo there is a procedure in place for the coordination of such actions two purported derivative suits have also been filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california and those federal court actions have been consolidated the consolidated federal court derivative action was dismissed by the court and plaintiffs have appealed from that decision the complaints in the various derivative actions include claims for breach of fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets mismanagement unjust enrichment and violations of the california corporations code seek compensatory and other damages disgorgement and other relief and are based on essentially the same allegations as the class actions 

  

in addition we are subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1 business general this annual report on form 10k “report” including the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” which is incorporated by reference from cisco’s 2002 annual report to shareholders contains forwardlooking statements regarding future events and the future results of cisco that are based on current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the industries in which cisco operates and the beliefs and assumptions of the management of cisco words such as ‘expects’ ‘anticipates’ ‘targets’ ‘goals’ ‘projects’ ‘intends’ ‘plans’ ‘believes’ ‘seeks’ ‘estimates’ variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forwardlooking statements factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed in this report under the section entitled “risk factors” and elsewhere and in other reports cisco files with the securities and exchange commission “sec” specifically the most recent reports on form 8k and form 10q each as it may be amended from time to time cisco undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forwardlooking statements for any reason cisco systems inc “cisco” manufactures and sells networking and communications products and provides services associated with that equipment and its use its products are installed at corporations public institutions and telecommunication companies and are also found in small and mediumsized commercial enterprises cisco provides a broad line of products for transporting data voice and video within buildings across campuses or around the world cisco conducts its business globally and is managed geographically in four segments the americas europe the middle east and africa “emea” asia pacific and japan see note 12 “segment information and major customers” on pages 46 and 47 of cisco’s 2002 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference herein cisco was incorporated in california in december 1984 and is headquartered in san jose cisco’s headquarters mailing address is

networking products that cover a wide range of customers’ networking needs cisco’s products and services help customers build their own network infrastructure while also providing tools to allow them to communicate with their customers prospects business partners suppliers and employees products are used individually or in combinations to connect computing devices to networks or computer networks with each other — whether they are within a building across a campus or around the world cisco’s breadth of product and service offerings enables it to offer a wide 3   range of products and services to meet customer requirements cisco also provides products and services that allow customers to transition their various networks to a single multiservice data voice and video network over time cisco believes that the internet and the various networks associated with it including but not limited to corporate intranets cable broadband and dialup networks and voice and video networks will converge into a “network of networks” in that environment the successful vendors will be those capable of providing an endtoend spectrum of products aimed not at a particular technology platform but at solutions to networking problems which cut across the segmentation that currently defines the industry as such a large part of cisco’s strategic initiatives and investments is aimed at meeting the requirements that such a network of networks would demand for a discussion of the risks associated with that strategy please see the portion of this report entitled “risk factors” including but not limited to the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and are subject to rapid changes in technology and the market” cisco’s offerings fall into several categories routing routing is a foundation technology for computer networking routers interconnect computer networks and move information from one network to another cisco’s routing products offer features to increase security of transmissions and increase efficiency in use of transmission capacity we offer a broad range of routers from core backbone infrastructure to small office deployments in addition cisco’s storage networking products offer customers a variety of options in accessing and interconnecting storage networks that can be shared and managed globally switching switching is another integral networking technology that is used in both localarea networks “lans” and widearea networks wans cisco’s switching products are designed to help users migrate from traditional shared lans to fully switched networks cisco solutions employ several widely used switching technologies including ethernet gigabit ethernet token ring and asynchronous transfer mode atm access cisco access products give remotely located groups and individuals similar levels of connectivity and information access to achieve seamless connections for users whether they are located at a company’s head office or at home or while they are traveling asynchronous and integrated services digital network isdn remoteaccess routers dialup access servers wireless solutions digital subscriber line dsl technologies and cable universal broadband routers provide telecommuters mobile workers and students with remote network access 4   other products other cisco offerings include the following products ip telephony cisco provides ip telephony products for transmitting voice communications over a network using an open standardsbased internet protocol cisco’s ip telephony products use a single network infrastructure for the transmission of data voice and video traffic to deliver ip voice and fully integrated communications ip telephony products provide a seamless migration to full ip communications by interoperating with existing systems internet network service and security cisco offers internet network products and services to improve a network manager’s ability to cope with challenges posed by the popularity of the internet such as network traffic volume and network address shortages cisco seeks to achieve architectural consistency by focusing on standardsbased services between clients and servers such as endtoend quality of service “qos” and endtoend security optical networking cisco provides optical networking products for both the enterprise and service provider markets advances in nextgeneration synchronous optical networksynchronous digital hierarchy sonetsdh provide an evolutionary path for telecommunications carriers from their existing infrastructures as well as giving newer carriers and enterprises the capability to deploy costeffective multiservice networks cisco also uses optical technologies such as dense wave division multiplexing dwdm and coarse wave division multiplexing cwdm to scale optical bandwidth as highbandwidth applications such as gigabit ethernet and storage to become more commonplace network management software cisco’s network management offerings are built around ciscoworks software a family of management applications based on internet standards these tools are designed to enable customers to better secure monitor and manage large complex networks for service providers cisco internet oss is a foundation and framework designed for nextgeneration internet protocol “ip”based services and packet network infrastructure cisco internet oss provides management enablement of intelligent network services the technologies offered in conjunction with product offerings are cisco avvid and cisco ios® software cisco avvid provides an intelligent network infrastructure for internet business solutions and consists of several architectural building blocks for key internet services cisco ios software is a common networking software platform deployed across a broad spectrum of cisco products 5   service in addition to its product offerings cisco provides a broad range of service offerings including technical maintenance support and consultative services to assist customers in building and maintaining highavailability networks in knowledge transfer and in building customer satisfaction cisco services provide devicelevel networklevel and applicationlevel support for all stages of the network life cycle these services help customers and channel partners by assisting them to deploy new technologies achieve highavailability networking streamline business processes and reduce operating costs customers and markets networking needs are influenced by a number of factors including the size of the organization number and types of computer systems geographic location and the applications requiring communications cisco’s customer base is not concentrated in any particular industry and in each of the past three fiscal years no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of cisco’s net sales for additional information regarding segment information see note 12 “segment information and major customers” on pages 46 and 47 of cisco’s 2002 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference herein cisco’s customers are primarily in the following markets large enterprise businesses large enterprise businesses are generally defined as organizations with 500 or more employees and often have complex networking needs as well as multiple locations and various types of computer systems such enterprise customers include corporations government agencies utilities and educational institutions cisco products for these customers include those designed for enterprise routing switching security and ip telephony service providers service providers offer data voice andor video communication services to businesses governments utilities and consumers they include regional national and international telecommunications carriers as well as internet cable and wireless service providers many service providers resell cisco products to their own residential enterprise or commercial customers these customers use a variety of cisco switching routing and management products in their networks compared to other enduser customers service provider customers are more likely to require network design services and their business is characterized by long design cycles historically service providers relied on equipment suppliers to take greater responsibility for implementation of turnkey solutions or to act as prime contractors in deploying network solutions with implications for timing of revenue recognition the large number of new entrants to this business in the late 1990s and the eventual lack of sufficient customer demand for telecommunications services to meet the business plans of all entrants has led to a condition of oversupply leading many service providers to cease operations and the remaining 6   companies particularly in the united states to significantly reduce projected and actual technologyrelated capital expenditures commercial commercial customers primarily small and mediumsized businesses have fewer than 500 employees and a need for networks of their own as well as connection to the internet and to business partners however these customers generally have limited resources and expertise in networking technology therefore cisco attempts to provide products that are affordable and easy to install and use the commercial market remains an area of potential growth for network adoption and deployment of intelligent network solutions the emerging markets which include network security mobility and converged voice and data solutions are of specific interest to small and mediumsized businesses cisco also works to set standards for the consumer market through the internet home alliance cisco sales overview cisco’s worldwide sales and marketing organization at july 27 2002 consisted of approximately 14000 individuals including managers sales representatives and technical support personnel cisco has field sales offices in more than 60 countries and sells its products and services both directly and through channel partners with support from its sales force channel partners include distributors valueadded resellers system integrators and service providers the system integrators and valueadded resellers buying through distributors often provide system installation technical support and followup services to the end customers for additional information regarding cisco’s sales see note 12 “segment information and major customers” on pages 46 and 47 of cisco’s 2002 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference herein cisco’s service offerings complement its products via a range of consulting technical project quality and maintenance supportlevel services including 24x7 online and telephone support through technical assistance centers cisco systems capital corporation facilitates and provides lease and other financing to certain qualified customers for the purchase of equipment and other needs for additional information regarding cisco systems capital corporation’s financing activities see note 6 “lease receivables net” on page 37 of cisco’s 2002 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference herein 7   acquisitions investments and alliances the markets in which cisco competes require a wide variety of technologies products and capabilities the combination of complexity and rapid change make it difficult for one company no matter how large to develop all technological solutions alone through acquisitions investments and alliances cisco is able to deliver products and services to customers in target markets cisco employs the following strategies to satisfy the need for new or enhanced networking products and solutions develop new technologies and products internally enter into jointdevelopment efforts with other companies resell another company’s product or acquire all or part of another company acquisitions since 1993 cisco has acquired a number of companies and cisco expects to make future acquisitions mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky especially if no product has been shipped by the acquired company no assurance can be given that cisco’s previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect its financial condition or operating results prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in the “risk factors” section contained in item 1 of this report investments in privately held companies cisco makes minority investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to cisco products or provide strategic value by investing in new ventures cisco strengthens its relationships with such companies the risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in the “risk factors” section contained in item 1 of this report strategic alliances cisco pursues strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets the objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product and solution development joint sales and marketing or newmarket creation currently cisco has entered into strategic alliances with callisma cap geminiernst  young eds hewlettpackardcompaq ibm intel italtel kpmg consulting microsoft motorola oracle sony and sun microsystems among others 8   backlog cisco’s backlog at september 9 2002 was approximately 14 billion compared with a backlog of approximately 20 billion at september 14 2001 we include in backlog only orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit status because of the generally short cycle between order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty cisco does not believe that its backlog as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual net sales for any future period competition cisco competes in the networking and communications equipment markets providing products and services for transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the internet the market is characterized by rapid change converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages these market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to cisco cisco competes with numerous vendors in each product category the overall number of competitors providing niche product solutions may increase due to the market’s longterm attractive growth cisco’s competitors include 3com alcatel avaya avici check point software ciena dell ericsson enterasys extreme networks foundry networks fujitsu huawei juniper lucent marconi nokia nortel networks redback networks riverstone siemens ag and sycamore networks among others some of these companies compete across many of cisco’s product lines while others are primarily focused in a specific product area barriers to entry are relatively low and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with cisco’s products are regularly formed in addition several of cisco’s current and potential competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than it does the principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include  cisco also faces competition from customers to whom it licenses or supplies technology and suppliers from whom it transfers technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability as such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many 9   companies any inability of cisco to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers and suppliers or the uncontrollable and unpredictable acts of others could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition and accordingly affect its chances of success research and development cisco regularly seeks to introduce new products and features in areas including among others data voice and video over ip advanced access and aggregation technologies such as cable wireless and other broadband technologies advanced enterprise switching optical transport storage networking content networking security network management and advanced core and edge routing technologies the industry in which cisco competes is subject to rapid technological developments evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and new product introductions and enhancements as a result cisco’s success in part depends upon its ability on a costeffective and timely basis to continue to enhance its existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership in order to achieve these objectives cisco’s management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities laboratories and corporations cisco also expects to continue to make acquisitions and investments where appropriate cisco intends to work to achieve products that meet key industry standards and to continue to support important protocol standards as they emerge still there can be no assurance that cisco will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that such products will achieve market acceptance cisco’s research and development expenditures were 34 billion 39 billion and 27 billion in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively all of cisco’s expenditures for research and development costs as well as inprocess research and development of 65 million 855 million and 14 billion in fiscal 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively have been expensed as incurred manufacturing cisco primarily employs an outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies on contract manufacturers for manufacturing services cisco’s manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of materials and components subassemblies final assembly and test of products we presently use a variety of independent thirdparty companies to provide services related to printed circuit board assembly incircuit test and product repair as well as product assembly cisco and its suppliers install proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips installed in its systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain quality control and security the manufacturing process enables cisco to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements cisco also uses automated testing equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process control to ensure the quality and reliability of its products cisco and its partners’ manufacturing processes and procedures are 10   generally iso 9001 or iso 9003 certified patents intellectual property and licensing cisco seeks to establish and maintain its proprietary rights in its technology and products through the use of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws cisco has a program to file applications for and obtain patents copyrights and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where it believes filing for such protection is appropriate cisco also seeks to maintain its trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements cisco has obtained a substantial number of patents in the united states and in other countries the existence of patents does not mean however that these patents are valid or can be enforced against competitive products in every jurisdiction although cisco believes the protection afforded by its patents patent applications copyrights trademarks and trade secrets has value the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process makes cisco’s future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise and management abilities of its employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws many cisco products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products cisco believes based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms nonetheless there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability of cisco to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on its business operating results and financial condition moreover inclusion in cisco’s products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit cisco’s ability to protect its proprietary rights in its products the industry in which cisco competes is characterized by rapidly changing technology a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights there can be no assurance that cisco’s patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to cisco or that its rights will give cisco a competitive advantage in which it competes in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect cisco’s proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states the risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in the “risk factors — our business depends upon our proprietary rights which might prove difficult to enforce and there is a risk our products could be held to infringe rights of third parties ” section contained in item 1 of this report employees as of july 27 2002 cisco has approximately 36000 employees including 6000 in manufacturing and service 13000 in engineering 14000 in sales and marketing and 3000 in finance and administration approximately 10000 employees are in locations outside the united 11   states cisco considers the relationships with its employees to be positive competition for technical personnel in the industry in which cisco competes is intense cisco believes that its future success depends in part on its continued ability to hire assimilate and retain qualified personnel to date cisco believes that it has been successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that it will continue to be successful in the future 12   risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in the report our operating results may fluctuate in future periods our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of a number of factors these factors include  as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods any of the foregoing factors or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 13   our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions adverse economic conditions worldwide have contributed to slowdowns in the communications and networking industries and may continue to impact our business resulting in  recent political turmoil in many parts of the world including terrorist and military actions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions if the economic and market conditions in the united states and globally do not improve or if they deteriorate further we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business operating results and financial condition as a consequence of the above factors or otherwise we do not expect the trend of lower capital spending among service providers to reverse itself in the near term our difficulty in predicting revenues may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results as a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report our revenues for a particular quarter are difficult to predict our net sales may grow at a slower rate than experienced in past periods and in particular periods may decline our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in certain of our past quarters recurs in future periods we have experienced periods of time where shipments exceeded net bookings leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns this can increase costs as irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods when overtime expenses may be incurred as well as leading to additional costs arising out of inventory management in addition to improve customer satisfaction we continue to attempt to reduce our manufacturing lead times which may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net sales and operating results going forward in the past long manufacturing lead times caused our customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and cancel the duplicative orders when the product is received from one of the channels from where it was ordered or place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times such multiple ordering along with other factors may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and as a result could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively 14   we plan our operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue levels these expenses and the impact of longterm commitments are relatively fixed in the shortterm a shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations as we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm business changes any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results we expect gross margin variability over time although we have experienced increasing product gross margins during fiscal 2002 product gross margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including but not limited to  changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as the changes in mix between technical support and consultative services as well as the timing of support contract renewals disruption of or changes in the mix of our product distribution model or customer base could affect sales and margins if we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected furthermore a change in the mix of our customers between service provider and enterprise or a change in mix of direct sales and indirect sales can adversely affect revenues and gross margins we use a variety of channels to bring our products to our customers including system integrators twotier distributors who in turn sell to resellers and direct sales to both enterprise accounts and service providers since each distribution channel has a distinct profile the failure 15   to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our gross margin and therefore profitability for example  we must manage inventory effectively particularly with respect to sales to distributors distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to the distributor and to seasonal fluctuations in enduser demand if we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins our twotier distribution channels in contrast to our onetier distributors are given privileges to return a portion of inventory and participate in various cooperative marketing programs in addition if sales through indirect channels increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and to a certain degree the timing of orders from our customers we recognize revenue to twotier distributors based on information provided by our distributors and also maintain accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs sales to the service provider market are especially volatile sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and often sporadic purchases with longer sales cycles we have experienced significant decreases in sales to service providers as market conditions have changed sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding and the extent that service providers are affected by regulatory economic and business conditions in the country of operations continued declines or delays in sales orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition particularly as we continue to invest in development of new products aimed at this market segment the slowdown in the general economy overcapacity changes in the service 16   provider market and the constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers with a number of such customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans these conditions have had a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and we expect that these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future finally service provider customers typically have longer design cycles require a broader range of service including design services demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks often have acceptance provisions which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendors all these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers we are dependent upon adequate component supply and manufacturing capacity our growth and ability to meet customer demands also depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers we have experienced component shortages in the past that have adversely affected our operations we may in the future experience a short supply of certain component parts as a result of strong demand in the industry for those parts or problems experienced by suppliers if shortages or delays persist the price of these components may increase or the components may not be available at all we may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed accordingly our revenues and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges going forward  manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant issues for us we use several contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide manufacturing services for our products during the normal course of business in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with certain contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components which could adversely affect our gross margins for additional information regarding our purchase commitments see note 8 “commitments and contingencies” on pages 17   38 to 40 of our 2002 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference herein a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the price of one or more components a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers or a decrease in demand of products could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships furthermore as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually utilized our gross margins could decrease the fact that we do not own the bulk of our manufacturing facilities could have an adverse impact on future products supply and on operating results financial problems of contract manufacturers on whom we rely or reservation of capacity by other companies inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase costs we have many substantial competitors for additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled “competition” contained in item 1 of this report we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and are subject to rapid changes in technology and the market the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and operating networks our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the costs to produce existing products as we have indicated in part 1 of this report we believe the internet and other data voice and video networks are evolving into a “network of networks” which will require common technology platforms and broad endtoend solutions for particular applications rather than products aimed at particular market segments in that environment customers will be more concerned with overall solutions rather than with whether the solution is built around a particular technology such as routing or switching the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed we must commit significant resources to develop new products before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept in particular if the “network of networks” does not emerge as we believe it will many of our investments may prove to be without value furthermore we may not execute successfully on that vision because of errors in product planning or timing technical hurdles which we fail to overcome in timely fashion or because of lack of appropriate resources this could result in competitors providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share revenues and earnings the success of new products is dependent on several factors including proper new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products 18   differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely manner and achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internetbased systems changes in industry structure could lead to product discontinuances a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the continued growth of the internet as a result of the economic slowdown and the reduction in capital spending which has particularly affected telecommunications service providers spending on internet infrastructure has declined which has had a material adverse effect on our business to the extent that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business operating results and financial condition because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as costeffectiveness and security we believe that there could be certain performance problems with internet communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility as we are a large supplier of networking products we may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business and could materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or to dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges such as inventory and technology related writeoffs and workforce reduction costs or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets including purchased intangible assets could change as a result of such assessments and decisions additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 19   we expect to make future acquisitions acquisitions involve numerous risks our growth is dependent upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis we have and will continue to address the need to develop new products through acquisitions of other companies and technologies including the personnel such acquisitions may bring to us acquisitions involve numerous risks including the following  acquisitions may also cause us to  mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions we make could harm our business and operating results in a material way prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products from time to time we have made acquisitions that result in inprocess research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter these charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our quarterly earnings 20   see also the discussion of risks related to new product development which also applies to acquisitions above under the risk factor entitled “we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products and are subject to rapid changes in technology and the market” the entrance into new or developing markets exposes our business and operations to risks as we focus on new market opportunities such as transporting data voice and video traffic across the same network we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies several of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater levels of service support and financing than we have provided in the past we expect that demand for these types of service or financing contracts may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities further provision of greater levels of services by us may result in a delay in the timing of revenue recognition product quality problems could lead to reduced revenues and gross margins we produce highly complex products which incorporate leadingedge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains “bugs” which can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations there can be no assurance that our preshipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects — either in individual products or which could affect numerous shipments — which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sales opportunities or affect gross margins if the cost of remedying the problems exceeded reserves established for that purpose in the past we have had to recall certain components while the cost of such recalls was not material there can be no assurance that such a recall depending on the product involved would not have a material impact an inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line and withdrawal at least temporarily from a product or market segment damage to our reputation inventory costs product reengineering expenses and a material impact on revenues and margins the industry in which we compete and the industries in which our customers compete are subject to consolidation there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years we expect this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more variability in operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers with 21   the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace comprised of more numerous participants our business is subject to risks from global operations we conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries outside of the united states and also depend on nonus operations of our contract manufacturers and our distribution partners for fiscal 2002 we derived 46 of our revenues from sales outside the united states accordingly our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates political or social unrest or economic instability in a specific country or region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements which may affect our ability to import or export our products from various countries service provider and government spending patterns affected by political considerations difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our future business we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states we face exposure to adverse movements in nonus currency exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales in japan canada and australia and certain nondollardenominated operating expenses in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the united states where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies currently we hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging activities undertaken by us are intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities our attempts to hedge against these risks may not be successful resulting in an adverse impact on our net income 22   we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets most of our sales are on an “open credit” basis with payment terms of 30 days typically in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the united states we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts beyond our open credit arrangements we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements we expect demand for customer financing to continue we believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and for working capital purposes because of the current slowdown in the global economy our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above have increased although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements particularly among internet businesses and service providers causing us to incur economic or financial losses there can be no assurance that should economic conditions not improve additional losses would not be incurred and that such losses would not be material although these losses have not been material to date future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition a portion of our sales is derived through our resellers in twotier distribution channels these resellerscustomers are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in various cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such exposures however such resellers tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations our business depends upon our proprietary rights which might prove difficult to enforce and there is a risk our products could be held to infringe rights of third parties we generally rely on patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products while we have been issued a number of patents and other patent applications are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that any rights granted under these patents will in fact provide competitive advantages to us in addition there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed 23   on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights in a market we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who do not have to incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create the innovative products which have enabled us to be successful from time to time third parties have asserted exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us these assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions particularly in the united states because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patents and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical nor even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe or will infringe the patent rights of others third parties including customers have asserted claims andor initiated litigation and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products regardless of the merit of these claims they can be timeconsuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into license agreements where claims are made by customers resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions if at all in all such circumstances or that our indemnification by their suppliers will be adequate to cover their costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 24   we face risks from the uncertainties of regulation of the internet currently few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulations could include matters such as voice over the internet or using internet protocol encryption technology and access charges for internet service providers our business could be materially adversely affected by the changes in the regulations surrounding the telecommunications industry the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition our success largely depends on our ability to retain and recruit key personnel our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel in spite of the economic slowdown competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees all of whom have been granted stock options the loss of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key objectives such as timely and effective product introductions in addition companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future we face certain litigation risks we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are involved see item 3 “legal proceedings” contained in part i of this report changes in effective tax rates could affect our results our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 25   our business is especially subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operations and our manufacturing facilities are located in the silicon valley area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally certain of our facilities which include one of our manufacturing facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake or a flood could have a material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial condition in addition despite our implementation of network security measures our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition in addition the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition the terrorist attacks in new york and washington dc on september 11 2001 disrupted commerce throughout the world and intensified the uncertainty of the us and other economies the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat or any future acts of terrorism may cause further disruptions to these economies and create further uncertainties to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax part of this portfolio includes equity investments in several publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility recent events have adversely affected the public equities market and general economic conditions may continue to worsen as a result we may recognize in earnings the decline in fair value of our publicly traded equity investments below the cost basis when the decline is judged to be otherthantemporary for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates see the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” on pages 23 and 24 of our 2002 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference herein furthermore our equity investments in both publicly traded companies and private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies 26   we are subject to risks associated with strategic alliances we have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with whom we work to offer complementary products and services these arrangements are generally limited to specific projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards if successful these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however these alliances carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties we face risks associated with changes in telecommunications regulation and tariffs changes in telecommunications requirements in the united states or other countries could affect the sales of our products in particular we believe it is possible that there may be changes in us telecommunications regulations in the future that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the united states our products must comply with various federal communications commission requirements and regulations in countries outside of the united states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition our stock price may continue to be volatile our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a result of variations between our actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position financial condition results of operations business or significant transactions can cause changes in stock price in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in particular and that have often been

customers and markets

networking needs are influenced by a number of factors including the size of
the organization number and types of computer systems geographic location and
the applications requiring data communications the cisco customer base is not
concentrated in any particular industry and in each of the past five fiscal
years no single customer has accounted for 10 percent or more of the companys
net sales for additional information regarding segment information for the
company see note 13 segment information and major customers on pages 43 to
45 of the companys 2001 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by
reference herein

ciscos customers are primarily in the following markets

large enterprise businesses

enterprise customers generally are large organizations with 500 or more
employees with complex networking needs usually spanning multiple locations and
types of computer systems enterprise customers include corporations government
agencies utilities and educational institutions

service providers

these customers provide data voice and video communication services to
businesses and consumers they include regional national and international
long distance telecommunications carriers as well as internet cable and
wireless service providers

small and mediumsized businesses

these customers have fewer than 500 employees and a need for networks of their
own as well as connection to the internet and to business partners however
these customers generally have limited resources and expertise in networking
technology therefore the company attempts to provide products that are
affordable and easy to install and use

cisco also works to set standards for the consumer market through the internet
home alliance this notforprofit open alliance was established based on a
shared mission of making a difference through market collaboration and
education

acquisitions investments and alliances

the endtoend networking strategy pursued by cisco requires a wide variety of
technologies products and capabilities the combination of complexity and
rapid change make it difficult for one company no matter how large to develop
all technological solutions alone acquisitions investments and alliances are
tools used by the company to fill technical gaps in its offerings and enable it
to deliver complete solutions to customers and prospects in its target markets
the companys acquisitions have reinforced its commitment to providing an
endtoend networking solution

satisfying customers networking needs requires a constant monitoring of market
and technology trends plus an ability to act quickly cisco employs one of the
following strategies to satisfy the need for new or enhanced networking products
and solutions develop new technologies and products internally enter into
jointdevelopment efforts with other companies resell another companys
product or acquire all or part of another company

since 1993 cisco has acquired a number of companies the company expects to
make future acquisitions where it believes that it can acquire new technologies
and products mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are
inherently risky and no assurance can be given that the companys previous or
future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect
the companys financial condition or operating results the risks associated
with acquisitions are more fully discussed in the risk factors section
contained in item 1 of this report


                                       8

minority investments

the company makes minority investments in companies that develop technology or
provide services that are complementary to cisco products or that support the
internet by investing in new ventures cisco strengthens its partnerships with
such companies together cisco and its partners can offer more complete
solutions to the market

strategic alliances

cisco pursues strategic alliances with other industry leaders in areas where
collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new markets
the objectives and goals for a strategic alliance can include one or more of the
following technology exchange product and solution development joint sales
and marketing and newmarket creation to date cisco has entered into
alliances with callisma cap geminiernst  young compaq hewlett packard
intel ibm italtel kpmg consulting inc microsoft motorola oracle sun
microsystems and thrupoint among others

backlog

the companys backlog at september 14 2001 was approximately 203 billion
compared with a backlog of approximately 340 billion at september 25 2000
the company includes in its backlog only orders confirmed with a purchase order
for products to be shipped within 90 days to customers with approved credit
status during fiscal 2001 the company changed its backlog policy to include
products that will be shipped within 90 days from the previous policy of 120
days under the terms of the previous policy the backlog at september 25 2000
was approximately 383 billion because of the generally short cycle between
order and shipment and occasional customer changes in delivery schedules or
cancellation of orders which are made without significant penalty the company
does not believe that its backlog as of any particular date is necessarily
indicative of actual net sales for any future period

competition

cisco competes in the internet infrastructure market providing solutions for
transporting data voice and video traffic across intranets extranets and the
internet the market is characterized by rapid change converging technologies
and a conversion to new world solutions that offer superior advantages these
market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to cisco
the company competes with numerous vendors in each product category the overall
number of competitors providing niche product solutions may increase due to the
markets longterm attractive growth on the other hand the company expects the
number of vendors supplying endtoend networking solutions will decrease due
to consolidations in and accompanying economic pressure upon the industry the
company believes its primary competition comes from nimble startups and young
companies offering innovative niche solutions

ciscos competitors include alcatel ciena ericsson extreme networks foundry
networks juniper lucent nortel networks redback networks siemens ag and
sycamore networks


                                       9
page   10

among others some of the companys competitors compete across many of its
product lines while others do not offer as wide a breadth of solutions several
of the companys current and potential competitors have greater resources
including technical and engineering resources than it does

the principal competitive factors in the markets in which the company presently
competes and may compete in the future are

      the ability to provide endtoend networking solutions and support

      performance

      price

      the ability to provide new technologies and products

      the ability to provide valueadded features such as security
       reliability and investment protection

      conformance to standards

      market presence

      the ability to provide financing

the company also faces competition from customers to whom it licenses technology
and suppliers from whom it transfers technology the inherent nature of
networking requires interoperability as such the company must cooperate and at
the same time compete with these companies the companys inability to
effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers and suppliers
or the uncontrollable and unpredictable acts of others could have a material
adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial
condition

research and development

the company has enhanced and extended its product lines with new product and
feature introductions in areas including data voice and video over ip
wireless access dial access enterprise switching optical transport storage
networking content networking security network management advanced routing
and switching technologies dsl technologies cable and other broadband
technologies among others

however the industry in which cisco competes is subject to rapid technological
developments evolving industry standards changes in customer requirements and
new product introductions and enhancements as a result the companys success
in part depends upon its ability on a costeffective and timely basis to
continue to enhance its existing solutions and to develop and introduce new
solutions that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership in order
to achieve these objectives the companys management and engineering personnel
work closely with customers to identify and respond to customer needs as well
as with other innovators of internetworking products including universities
laboratories and corporations the company also expects to continue to make
strategic acquisitions and equity investments where appropriate the company
intends to remain dedicated to industry standards and to continue to support
important protocol standards as they emerge still there can be no assurance
that cisco will be able to successfully develop new products to address new
customer requirements and


                                       10
page   11

technological changes or that such products will achieve market acceptance

the companys research and development expenditures were 392 billion 270
billion and 166 billion in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively all of
the companys expenditures for research and development costs as well as
inprocess research and development of 855 million 137 billion and 471
million in fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively have been expensed as
incurred

manufacturing

the companys manufacturing operations primarily consist of quality assurance of
materials components and subassemblies additionally the company performs
final assembly and test the company presently uses a variety of independent
thirdparty companies to perform printed circuit board assembly incircuit
test and product repair the company and its supply partners install
proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips installed in
its systems in order to configure products to customer needs and to maintain
quality control and security the manufacturing process enables the company to
configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide
variety of individual customer requirements and provide turnkey solutions to its
customers the company and its supply partners also use automated testing
equipment and burnin procedures as well as comprehensive inspection
testing and statistical process control to assure the quality and reliability
of its products the companys and its partners manufacturing processes and
procedures are iso 9001 or iso 9003 certified

patents intellectual property and licensing

ciscos success is dependent upon its proprietary technology cisco generally
relies upon patents copyrights trademarks and trade secret laws to establish
and maintain its proprietary rights in its technology and products cisco has a
program to file applications for and obtain patents in the united states and in
selected foreign countries where a potential market for ciscos products exists
cisco has been issued a number of patents other patent applications are
currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patents will not
be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that any rights granted
thereunder will provide competitive advantages to cisco in addition there can
be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that
claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect
ciscos technology in addition the laws of some foreign countries may not
permit the protection of ciscos proprietary rights to the same extent as do the
laws of the united states although cisco believes the protection afforded by
its patents patent applications copyrights and trademarks has value the
rapidly changing technology in the networking industry makes ciscos future
success dependent primarily on the innovative skills technological expertise
and management abilities of its employees rather than on patent copyright and
trademark protection

the industry in which cisco competes is characterized by the existence of a
large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding
patent and other intellectual property rights from time to time third parties
have asserted exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual
property rights to technologies and related standards that are important to


                                       11
page   12

cisco these claims have increased recently as a result of the companys
acquisitions of businesses and technologies such parties have pursued and may
in the future assert claims or initiate litigation against the company or its
manufacturers suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their
proprietary rights with respect to the companys existing or future products
regardless of the merit of these claims they could be timeconsuming result in
costly litigation and diversion of technical management personnel or require
cisco to develop a noninfringing technology or enter into royalty or license
agreements if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made
against the company by any third party is successful or if the company fails to
develop noninfringing technology or license the proprietary rights the
companys business could be materially and adversely affected

many of ciscos products are designed to include software or other intellectual
property licensed from third parties while it may be necessary in the future to
seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of its products cisco
believes that based upon past experience and standard industry practice such
licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms because
of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field and the
rapid rate of issuance of new patents it is not economically practical to
determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringe patent
rights of others from time to time cisco receives notices from or is sued by
third parties regarding patent infringement claims if infringement claims are
found to have merit cisco believes that based upon industry practice any
necessary license or rights under such patents may be obtained on terms that
would not have a material adverse effect on ciscos business operating results
or financial condition nevertheless there can be no assurance that the
necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms if at all the
inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses
or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding
these matters could have a material adverse effect on ciscos business
operating results and financial condition

employees

as of july 28 2001 the company employed approximately 38000 persons
including 7000 in manufacturing service and support 13000 in engineering
15000 in sales and marketing and 3000 in finance and administration
approximately 11000 employees were in international locations the company
considers the relationships with its employees to be positive the company has
not experienced any work stoppages competition for technical personnel in the
industry in which cisco competes may be intense the company believes that its
future success depends in part on its continued ability to hire assimilate and
retain qualified personnel to date cisco believes that the company has been
successful in recruiting qualified employees but there is no assurance that the
company will continue to be successful in the future

risk factors

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file
with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking
statements contained in the report

you should expect that our operating results may fluctuate in future periods

the results of operations for any quarter or fiscal year are not necessarily
indicative of results to be expected in future periods our operating results
have in the past been and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual
fluctuations as a result of a number of factors these factors include

      overall information technology spending

      changes in general economic conditions and specific market conditions in
       the communications and networking industries

      fluctuations in demand for our products and services

      the long sales and implementation cycle for our products and the reduced
       visibility into our customers spending plans and associated revenue

      inventory levels exceeding our requirements based upon future demand
       forecasts

      existing network capacity sharing of existing network capacity and
       network capacity utilization rates of our customers

      price and product competition in the networking industry

      the overall trend toward industry consolidation

      the introduction and market acceptance of new technologies and products
       as well as the adoption of new networking standards

      variations in sales channels product costs or mix of products sold

      the timing of orders timing of shipments and the ability to satisfy all
       contractual obligations in customer contracts

      manufacturing lead times

      the impact of acquired businesses and technologies

      the geographical mix of our revenue and the associated impact on gross
       margin

      our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions

      adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets

      the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund
       capital expenditures

      the trend toward sales of integrated network solutions

      the timing and amount of employer payroll tax to be paid on employees
       gains on stock options exercised

as a consequence operating results for a particular future period are difficult
to predict especially in recent periods any of the foregoing factors or any
other factors discussed elsewhere herein could have a material adverse effect
on our business results of operations and financial condition


                                       13
page   14

in response to changes in industry and market conditions we may strategically
realign our resources and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise
exiting businesses any decision to limit investment in or to dispose of or
otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of accrued liabilities for
special onetime charges such as workforce reduction costs additionally
estimates with respect to the useful life and ultimate recoverability of our
carrying basis of assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets
could change as a result of such assessments and decisions

we are exposed to general economic and market conditions

our business is subject to the effects of general economic conditions in the
united states and globally and in particular market conditions in the
communications and networking industries in recent quarters our operating
results have been adversely affected as a result of unfavorable economic
conditions and reduced capital spending in the united states europe and asia
in particular sales to service providers ecommerce and internet businesses
and the manufacturing industry in the united states were adversely affected
during fiscal 2001 if the economic conditions in the united states and globally
do not improve or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown
we may continue to experience material adverse impacts on our business
operating results and financial condition

operating results for a particular quarter are difficult to predict

as a result of a variety of factors discussed herein operating results for a
particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict our net sales may grow at
a slower rate than experienced in previous periods and in particular periods
may decline our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely
affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in certain of our recent quarters
recurs in future periods we generally have had at least one quarter of the
fiscal year when backlog has been reduced although such reductions have not
occurred consistently in recent years they are difficult to predict and may
occur in the future in addition in response to customer demand we continue to
attempt to reduce our product manufacturing lead times which may result in
corresponding reductions in order backlog a decline in backlog levels could
result in more variability and less predictability in our quartertoquarter net
sales and operating results going forward on the other hand for certain
products lead times are longer than our goal if we cannot reduce manufacturing
lead times for such products our customers may place the same orders within our
various sales channels cancel orders or not place further orders if shorter
lead times are available from other manufacturers

as a result of our growth in past periods our fixed costs have increased with
increased levels of spending and the impact of longterm commitments an
inability to meet expected revenue levels in a particular quarter could have a
material adverse impact on our operating results for that period as we may not
be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to shortterm
business changes

any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations
and financial results for example from time to time we have made acquisitions
that result in inprocess


                                       14

research and development expenses being charged in an individual quarter these
charges may occur in any particular quarter resulting in variability in our
quarterly earnings additionally the operating results for a quarter could be
materially adversely affected if a number of large orders are either not
received or are delayed for example due to cancellations delays or deferrals
by customers

we expect gross margin variability over time

we expect gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or
labor costs higher inventory balances obsolescence charges loss of cost
savings price competition and changes in channels of distribution or in the
mix of products sold in particular optical and access products

if product or related warranty costs associated with our products are greater
than we have experienced gross margin may be adversely affected our gross
margin may also be adversely affected by geographic mix as well as the mix of
configurations within each product group we continue to expand into thirdparty
or indirectdistribution channels which generally results in a lower gross
margin these distribution channels are generally given privileges to return
inventory in addition increasing thirdparty and indirectdistribution
channels generally results in greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our
products and to a certain degree the timing of orders from our customers

we plan our operating expense levels primarily based on forecasted revenue
levels because these expenses are relatively fixed in the shortterm a
shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations

we are dependent upon adequate component supply and manufacturing capacity

our growth and ability to meet customer demands also depend in part on our
capability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers we have
experienced component shortages in the past that have adversely affected our
operations although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of
shortages there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems
in the future although we generally use standard parts and components for our
products certain components are presently available only from a single source
or limited sources

while our suppliers have performed effectively and have been relatively flexible
to date we believe that we may be faced with the following challenges going
forward

      new markets that we participate in may grow quickly and thus consume
       significant component capacity


                                       15
page   16

      as we continue to acquire companies and new technologies we are
       dependent at least initially on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively
       small supply partners

      we face competition for certain components which are supply constrained
       from existing competitors and companies in other markets

manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could be significant
issues for us we use several supply partners to manufacture our products
during the normal course of business in order to reduce manufacturing lead
times and ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreements with
certain supply partners which allow these partners to procure inventory based
upon criteria as defined by us for additional information regarding our
purchase commitments see note 9 commitments and contingencies on pages 36 to
38 of our 2001 annual report to shareholders which is incorporated by reference
herein a reduction or interruption in supply a significant increase in the
price of one or more components or a decrease in demand of products could
materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial
condition and could materially damage customer relationships

we compete in the highly competitive telecommunications equipment market

for additional information regarding our competition see the section entitled
competition contained in item 1 of this report

we have invested in and will continue to invest in new and existing market
opportunities

we have made investments in headcount inventory manufacturing capacity and
product development through internal efforts and acquisitions as a result of
growth in existing opportunities and new or emerging opportunities in our target
markets over the past years we will continue to invest in these markets either
through additional investments or through realignment of existing resources

we depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing
products and are subject to rapid changes in technology and the market

our operating results may depend on our ability to develop and introduce new
products into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the costs to produce
existing products the success of new products is dependent on several factors
including proper new product definition product cost timely completion and
introduction of new products differentiation of new products from those of our
competitors and market acceptance of these products the markets for our
products are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry
standards new product introductions and evolving methods of building and
operating networks there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify
new product opportunities develop and bring new products to market in a timely
manner and achieve market acceptance of our products or that products and
technologies developed by others will not render our products or technologies
obsolete or noncompetitive

our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and
internetbased systems

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the continued
growth of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers that
depend on the growth of the internet as a result of the economic slowdown and
the reduction in capital spending spending on internet infrastructure has
declined which has had a material adverse effect on our business to the extent
that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to
adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure we could continue to
experience material adverse effects on our business operating results and
financial condition

we believe that there will be certain performance problems with internet
communications in the future which could receive a high degree of publicity and
visibility as we are a large supplier of networking products we may be
materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problems are
due to the performance of our products such an event could also result in a
material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and could
materially adversely affect our business operating results and financial
condition

we expect to make future acquisitions where advisable and acquisitions involve
numerous risks

the networking business is highly competitive and as such our growth is
dependent upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing products and
our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis one of the ways we have
addressed and will continue to address the need to develop new products is
through acquisitions of other companies and technologies acquisitions involve
numerous risks including the following

      difficulties in integrating the operations technologies and products of
       the acquired companies

      the risk of diverting managements attention from normal daily operations
       of the business

      potential difficulties in completing projects associated with inprocess
       research and development

      risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior
       experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market
       positions

      initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply
       partners

      insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with
       acquisitions

      the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and
no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be
successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating
results or financial condition we must also manage any growth effectively
failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquisitions we
make could harm our business and operating results in a material way


                                       17

the entrance into new or developing markets exposes our business and operations
to risks

as we focus on new market opportunities such as transporting data voice and
video traffic across the same network we will increasingly compete with large
telecommunications equipment suppliers such as alcatel ericsson lucent
nortel and siemens ag among others and several startup companies several of
our current and potential competitors may have greater resources including
technical and engineering resources than we do additionally as customers in
these markets complete infrastructure deployments they may require greater
levels of service support and financing than we have experienced in the past
we have not entered into a material amount of laborintensive service contracts
which require significant production or customization however we expect that
demand for these types of service contracts may increase in the future there
can be no assurance that we can provide products service support and
financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities further
provision of greater levels of services by us may result in less favorable
timing of revenue recognition than we have historically experienced

sales to the service provider market are subject to variation

sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and often
sporadic purchases sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of
completion of expanding network infrastructures the availability of funding
and the extent that service providers are affected by regulatory economic and
business conditions in the country of operations a decline or delay in sales
orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business
operating results and financial condition the slowdown in the general economy
changes in the service provider market and the constraints on capital
availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider
customers with a number of such customers going out of business or
substantially reducing their expansion plans these conditions have had a
material adverse effect on our business and operating results and we expect
that these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future

the industry in which we compete is subject to consolidation

there has been a trend toward industry consolidation for several years we
expect this trend toward industry consolidation to continue as companies attempt
to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry we believe
that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better
able to compete as solesource vendors for customers this could lead to more
variability in operating results as we compete to be a single vendor solution
and could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and
financial condition

our business is subject to risks from international operations

we conduct business globally accordingly our future results could be
materially adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing
factors including among others foreign currency exchange rates regulatory
political or economic conditions in a specific country or


                                       18
page   19

region trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements service
provider and government spending patterns and natural disasters any or all of
these factors could have a material adverse impact on our future international
business

we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency

as a global concern we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency
exchange rates these exposures may change over time as business practices
evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results
historically our primary exposures have related to nondollardenominated sales
in japan canada and australia and nondollardenominated operating expenses in
europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in us dollars
additionally we have exposures to emerging market currencies which have extreme
currency volatility we will continue to monitor our exposure and may hedge
against these or any other emerging market currencies as necessary

the increasing use of the euro as a common currency for members of the european
union could impact our foreign exchange exposure we are currently hedging
against fluctuations with the euro and will continue to evaluate the impact of
the euro on our future foreign exchange exposure as well as on our internal
systems at the present time we hedge only those currency exposures associated
with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and
periodically will hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows the hedging
activity undertaken by us is intended to offset the impact of currency
fluctuations on certain nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities

we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit
exposures in weakened markets

a portion of our sales is derived through our resellers in twotier distribution
channels these resellerscustomers are generally given privileges to return
inventory receive credits for changes in selling prices and participate in
cooperative marketing programs we maintain estimated accruals and allowances
for such exposures however such resellers tend to have access to more limited
financial resources than other resellers and enduser customers and therefore
represent potential sources of increased credit risk we have experienced
increased demands for customer financing including loan financing and leasing
solutions we expect demands for customer financing may continue we believe
customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business particularly
in supplying customers involved in significant infrastructure projects our loan
financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our
products but also providing additional funds for soft costs associated with
network installation and integration of our products and for working capital
purposes due to the current slowdown in the economy the credit risks relating
to these resellerscustomers have increased although we have programs in place
to monitor and mitigate the associated risk there can be no assurance that such
programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks we also continue to
monitor credit exposures from weakened financial conditions in certain
geographic regions and the impact that such conditions may have on the
worldwide economy we have experienced losses due to customers failing to meet
their obligations although these losses have not been


                                       19
page   20

significant future losses if incurred could harm our business and have a
material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition

our business depends upon our proprietary rights and there is a risk of
infringement

for additional information regarding our proprietary rights see the section
entitled patents intellectual property and licensing contained in item 1 of
this report

we face risks from the uncertainties of regulation of the internet

there are currently few laws or regulations that apply directly to access or
commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by
regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate
on technology such as voice over the internet encryption technology and access
charges for internet service providers our business could be materially
adversely affected by the changes in the regulations surrounding the
telecommunications industry the adoption of regulation of the internet and
internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and at the same time
increase the cost of selling our products which could have a material adverse
effect on our business operating results and financial condition

our success largely depends on our ability to retain and recruit key personnel

our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and
retain highly skilled technical managerial sales and marketing personnel in
spite of the economic slowdown competition for these personnel is intense
especially in the silicon valley area of northern california volatility or lack
of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability
to retain key employees all of whom have been granted stock options the loss
of services of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract
qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel
particularly engineers and sales personnel could make it difficult to meet key
objectives such as timely product introductions in addition companies in the
networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently
claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices we have
received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this
effect in the future

we face certain litigation risks

we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business litigation can
be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations moreover
the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict an
unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse
effect on our business results of operations or financial condition for
additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits in which we are
involved see item 3 legal proceedings contained in part i of this report

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes floods and other
catastrophic events

our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development
operations and our manufacturing facilities are located in the silicon valley
area of northern california a region known for seismic activity additionally
certain of our facilities which include one of our manufacturing facilities
are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past a
significant natural disaster such as an earthquake or a flood could have a
material adverse impact on our business operating results and financial
condition in addition despite our implementation of network security measures
our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses breakins and similar
disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems any such
event could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results
and financial condition in addition the effects of war or acts of terrorism
could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and
financial condition

the energy crisis in california could disrupt our business and the businesses of
our suppliers and supply partners and could increase our expenses

the western united states and california in particular has experienced
repeated episodes of diminished electrical power supply and we anticipate that
this situation could continue or worsen in the near future as a result of
these episodes certain of our operations or facilities have been and may
continue to be subject to rolling blackouts or other unscheduled interruptions
of electrical power the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue
for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict their occurrence or
duration certain of our suppliers and supply partners are also located in this
area and their operations may also be materially and adversely affected by such
interruptions these suppliers and manufacturers may be unable to manufacture
sufficient quantities of our products to meet our demands or they may increase
the costs of such products which in turn could have a material adverse effect
on our business or results of operations

we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments
and in interest rates

we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings types and maturities
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and
consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized
gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income loss net of tax part of this portfolio includes
minority equity investments in several publicly traded companies the values of
which are subject to market price volatility for example as a result of market
price volatility of our publicly traded equity investments we experienced a
576 billion 381 billion net of tax decrease in net unrealized gains
during fiscal 2001 on these investments as of july 28 2001 our publicly
traded equity investments had gross unrealized losses of 784 million recent
events have adversely affected the public equities market and general economic
conditions may continue to worsen as a result subsequent to fiscal 2001 we
may recognize in earnings declines in fair value of our publicly traded equity
investments below the cost basis that are considered to be otherthantemporary

we cannot predict the impact of recent actions and comments by the sec

the sec has been reviewing registrants valuation methodologies of inprocess
research and development related to business combinations we believe we are in
compliance with all of the existing rules and related guidance as applicable to
our business operations however the sec may change these rules or issue new
guidance applicable to our business in the future there can be no assurance
that the sec will not seek to reduce the amount of inprocess research and
development previously expensed by us this would result in the restatement of
our previously filed financial statements and could have a material adverse
effect on our operating results and financial condition for periods subsequent
to the acquisitions

we are subject to risks associated with strategic alliances

we have a number of strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and
our ecosystem partners these arrangements are generally limited to specific
projects the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and
adoption of industry standards if successful these relationships may be
mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however these alliances
carry an element of risk because in most cases we must compete in some
business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and at
the same time cooperate with that company in other business areas also if
these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as
expected we could suffer delays in product development or other operational
difficulties

we face risks associated with changes in telecommunications regulation and
tariffs

changes in domestic and international telecommunications requirements could
affect the sales of our products in particular we believe it is possible that
there may be changes in domestic telecommunications regulation in the near
future that could slow the expansion of the service providers network
infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business operating results
and financial condition future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or
application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect
the sales of our products for certain classes of customers additionally in the
united states our products must comply with various federal communications
commission requirements and regulations in countries outside of the united
states our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications
authorities changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of
products could have a material adverse effect on our business operating
results and financial condition

our stock price may be volatile

our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility particularly as a
result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results the
published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our
competitors and us in addition the stock market has experienced extreme price
and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology
companies in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating
performance of these companies these factors as well as general economic and
political conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our
common stock in the future additionally volatility or a lack of positive
performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key
employees all of whom have been granted stock options

item 3 legal proceedings

the company is subject to legal proceedings claims and litigation arising in
the ordinary course of business while the outcome of these matters is currently
not determinable management does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve
these matters will have a material adverse effect on the companys consolidated
financial position results of operations or cash flows

beginning on april 20 2001 a number of purported shareholder class action
lawsuits have been filed in the united states district court for the northern
district of california against the company and certain of its officers and
directors the lawsuits are essentially identical and purport to bring suit on
behalf of those who purchased the companys publicly traded securities between
august 10 1999 and april 16 2001 plaintiffs allege that defendants made false
and misleading statements purport to assert claims for violations of the
federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other
relief the company believes the claims are without merit and intends to defend
the actions vigorously

in addition beginning on april 23 2001 a number of purported shareholder
derivative lawsuits have been filed in the superior court of california county
of santa clara against the company as a nominal defendant its directors and
certain officers at least two purported derivative suits have also been filed
in the united states district court for the northern district of california and
another has been filed in the superior court of california county of san mateo
the complaints in the various derivative actions include claims for breach of
fiduciary duty waste of corporate assets mismanagement unjust enrichment and
violations of the california corporations code seek compensatory and other
damages disgorgement and other relief and are based on essentially the same
allegations as the class actions
