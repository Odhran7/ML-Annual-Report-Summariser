 item 1 business 

we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world our operations began in 1930 and we are incorporated in delaware with headquarters in dallas texas we have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries our two reportable segments are analog and embedded processing and we report the results of our remaining business activities in other in 2021 we generated 1834 billion of revenue 

for decades we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors we were pioneers in the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits as each generation became more reliable more affordable and lower in power semiconductors were used by a growing number of customers and markets this passion is alive today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications particularly in industrial and automotive markets 

for many years we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind first we will act like owners who will own the company for decades second we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing and third we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner when we are successful in achieving these ambitions our employees customers communities and shareholders all win 

as engineers we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innovate to create a better world technology is the foundation of our company but ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate longterm value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share 

our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements 

the first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitive advantages this business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made over the years and that continue today the four sustainable competitive advantages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products the reach of our market channels and diversity and longevity of our products markets and customer positions in combination these four competitive advantages provide tangible benefits are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers together these competitive advantages help position ti in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners we make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages 

the second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital this spans how we select rd projects develop new capabilities like ticom invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners over a 10year period from 2012 to 2021 we allocated 79 billion which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation the largest allocation over this period was to drive organic growth which includes investments in rd sales and marketing capital expenditures and working capital for inventory in this period we allocated just over 8 billion to capital expenditures and in the years ahead this amount will increase as we expect it to be the largest driver of longterm free cash flow growth beyond that we also allocated capital to dividends and share repurchases dividends are designed to appeal to a broad set of investors and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretive capture of future free cash flow for longterm investors lastly for inorganic growth we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectives 

the third element of our strategy is efficiency which we think of as constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent this is about getting our investments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of longterm free cash flow per share it is not just about optimizing costcutting to get to the last dollar of expense we bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improvement to all areas of the company and this focus on efficiency contributes to revenue growth improved gross margins disciplined rd and sga expense free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth 

we believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets ti apart from our peers and will for a long time to come we will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies finally we will remain focused on the belief that longterm growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value 

product information 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as “chips” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit we have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes approximately 80000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results 

analog 

our analog segment generated 1405 billion of revenue in 2021 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting distributing storing discharging isolating and measuring electrical energy whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery as the digitization of electronics continues there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings the real world and other electronic devices our analog products are used in many markets particularly industrial automotive and personal electronics 

sales of our analog products generated about 77 of our revenue in 2021 

our analog segment includes the following major product lines power and signal chain 

power 

power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels including batterymanagement solutions dcdc switching regulators acdc and isolated controllers and converters power switches linear regulators voltage references and lighting products 

signal chain 

signal chain includes products that sense condition and measure realworld signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control our signal chain products include amplifiers data converters interface products motor drives clocks logic and sensing products 

embedded processing 

our embedded processing segment generated 305 billion of revenue in 2021 embedded processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment they are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application our devices vary from simple lowcost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices such as motor control our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotive 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next 

sales of embedded processing products generated about 17 of our revenue in 2021 

our embedded processing segment includes microcontrollers digital signal processors dsps and applications processors microcontrollers are selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors are designed for specific computing activity 

other 

we report the results of our remaining business activities in other which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments other generated 125 billion of revenue in 2021 and includes revenue from dlp ® products primarily used to project highdefinition images calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics 

in other we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments examples of these items include acquisition integration and restructuring charges as well as certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions 

markets for our products 

the table below lists the major markets for our products in 2021 and the estimated percentage of our 2021 revenue that the market represented the chart also lists in declining order of our revenue the sectors within each market 

market characteristics 

competitive landscape 

despite recent consolidation the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia 

we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and reach of its channels to market technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities in addition manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

seasonality 

our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation historically our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters 

customers sales and distribution 

we sell our products to over 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with more than 40 of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100 

we market and sell our products through direct sales channels including our website and broad sales and applications team and to a lesser extent through distributors over the past several years we have been investing in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships for example in 2021 about twothirds of our revenue was direct and transactions on ticom grew to about 10 of our revenue as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design additionally broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs 

our investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and ecommerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services we expanded the reach of our ticom ecommerce channel by offering a localized online experience in many countries with convenience features such as immediate availability local currency payment methods invoicing and importer of record in addition to doing business directly with ti we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few regionspecific distributors for order fulfillment 

manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities 

we invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing inhouse this strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage provides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain we have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced 300millimeter capacity an unpackaged chip built on a 300millimeter wafer costs about 40 less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200millimeter wafer 

we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our longterm capacity planning progress and investments include 

• continuing construction of rfab2 richardson texas our next 300millimeter wafer fabrication facility to begin production in the second half of 2022 

• purchasing a 300millimeter wafer fabrication facility in lehi utah to support analog and embedded processing manufacturing which is expected to begin production in early 2023 and 

• planning construction on our next two 300millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in sherman texas to begin in 2022 this north texas site has the potential for up to four fabrication facilities to meet demand over time as semiconductor growth in electronics particularly in industrial and automotive markets is expected to continue well into the future production is expected to begin in 2025 

together these investments are designed to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage provide us with lower costs and greater control of our supply chain and support growth over the next 10 to 15 years 

we assess and are careful to address potential health safety and environmental risks presented by our operations including our manufacturing operations we care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials controlling harmful emissions and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances 

we expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2021 we sourced about 20 of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 of our assemblytest services from subcontractors 

inventory 

our objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service maintain stable and competitive lead times minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization to meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand our strategy is to build ahead of demand our broadbased products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from solesource suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have license agreements which vary in duration involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti a company with broad international operations like many companies we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results dividends or share repurchases and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

risks related to our business and industry 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition is uncertain 

the global spread of the coronavirus covid19 has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption both nearterm and potentially longterm we have modified and might further modify our business practices in response to the covid19 pandemic related thirdparty responses including from government authorities and our suppliers customers and distributors and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which ti operates the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to affect our business results of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including the duration and scope of the pandemic government social business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic and the effect of the pandemic on short and longterm general economic conditions we have experienced and continue to experience short or longterm constrained supply or volatility in customer demand which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political social economic or other conditions 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries about 90 of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states shipments of products to chinabased customers represent about 25 of our revenue certain countries where we operate have experienced and other countries may experience trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs import or export restrictions trade embargoes and sanctions restrictions on crossborder investment and other trade barriers trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into china cause chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results 

we are exposed to political social and economic conditions security risks terrorism or other hostile acts health conditions and epidemics labor conditions climate change risks and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate in addition our global operations expose us to periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment these actions in conjunction with trade tensions may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively certain competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows our results of operations may be adversely affected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments changes in demand for customer products or trade restrictions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets natural events epidemics or domestic or international political social economic or other conditions breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast due to strong demand our manufacturing lead times for some products are longer than normal and lead times might continue to extend we manufacture products with the intent to provide high levels of customer service our manufacturing forecasts are based on multiple assumptions and if inaccurate could cause us to hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity events breaches disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems 

breaches disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses system failures restricted network access unauthorized access terrorism employee malfeasance or human error these events could among other things compromise our information technology networks result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in the release of personal data or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection remediation regulatory inquiries or penalties or claims for damages any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers vendors and other third parties are frequent and constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them 

our ability to successfully implement strategic business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

from time to time we undertake strategic business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our objectives for example the purchase of our 300millimeter semiconductor factory in lehi utah in 2021 if we do not successfully implement these changes our business plans and operating results could be adversely affected we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth cost savings or other benefits of strategic business and organizational changes and charges associated with these actions could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations climate change might exacerbate these occurrences or cause natural disasters to occur with greater frequency a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations as listed in the properties section in item 2 may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products 

rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a timely and costeffective manner we make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products develop new products to meet changing customer demands and improve our production processes in some cases we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured further projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed 

we face supply chain and manufacturing risks 

we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a costeffective and timely manner our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our own or suppliers’ operations as a result of for example quality excursions uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets domestic or international political social economic and other conditions natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate or limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials natural resources services and utilities additionally a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

in particular our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment and those of our suppliers require that certain key materials natural resources services and utilities be available suppliers of these items have and might continue to extend lead times limit supply or increase prices due to factors beyond our control limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials natural resources services and utilities could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree 

our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we have made and will continue to make significant investments in manufacturing capacity and we might not realize our expected return on those investments we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have longterm contracts with all of these suppliers and the number of alternate suppliers is limited reliance on these suppliers involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely costeffective and appropriate manner the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property 

our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims product liability claims product recalls or legal proceedings 

claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures or other grounds relating to our products software manufacturing services designs communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a claim we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a ti part for example with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance 

in 2021 about onethird of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business 

our margins vary 

our profit margins vary due to a number of factors which may include customer demand and shipment volume our manufacturing processes product mix inventory levels tariffs freight costs and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards in addition we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel as well as the effective management of succession for key employees skilled and experienced personnel in our industry including engineering management marketing technical and staff personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws and policies including changes to or the administration or interpretation of those laws and policies 

legal and regulatory risks 

our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject 

we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example the environment and climate change safety health trade bribery and corruption financial reporting tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition market access epidemics intellectual property ownership and infringement and the movement of currency compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business if we do not comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business 

increased focus from government authorities investors customers and other key stakeholders on environmental social and governance esg matters has led to new and more stringent reporting standards and disclosure requirements as the nature scope and complexity of esg reporting diligence and disclosure requirements expand we might have to undertake costly efforts to control assess and report on esg metrics 

some of these complex laws rules and regulations – for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resources or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products a substitute for a prohibited material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate if our tax rate increases our results of operations could be adversely affected a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions changes in available tax credits or deductions including for amounts relating to stock compensation changes in applicable tax rates changes in tariff regulations or surcharges changes in accounting principles or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation changes in these laws and regulations including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax expense will change 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business there can be no assurance that as our business evolves we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on technology from others for which a license is required there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such a license at all or on terms we consider reasonable we directly and indirectly face infringement claims from third parties including nonpracticing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies we also face infringement claims where we or our customers make use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable these assertions whether or not of any merit expose us to claims for damages andor injunctions from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights however our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information including for example third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 

risks related to our financing activities and other risks 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including our other risk factors many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise might be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders or could cause us to raise funds by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling assets 

our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts a portfolio of investments access to one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and the ability to issue debt to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted 

material impairments of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet charges associated with impairments of goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world technology is the foundation of our company but ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate longterm value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share 

our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements 

1 a great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages the four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits 

i a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain 

ii a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments 

iii the reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs 

iv diversity and longevity of our products markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments 

together these competitive advantages help position ti in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners we make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages 

2 discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities this spans how we select rd projects develop new capabilities like ticom invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners 

3 efficiency which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent 

we believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets ti apart from our peers and will for a long time to come we will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies finally we will remain focused on the belief that longterm growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operations 

• our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results see note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments 

• when we discuss our results 

◦ unless otherwise noted changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes 

◦ new products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products 

◦ from time to time our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higherpriced or lowerpriced products which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped 

◦ because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase 

• for an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate” see the nongaap financial information section 

• all dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of us dollars 

our results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2021 and 2020 and yeartoyear comparisons between 2021 and 2020 discussion of 2019 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this form 10k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide including at ti therefore we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations 

results of operations 

our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets industrial automotive personal electronics communications equipment enterprise systems and other while all end markets represent good opportunities we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets which we believe represent the best growth opportunities gross margin of 675 reflected the quality of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy including the benefit of 300millimeter production 

our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations our cash flow from operations of 876 billion underscored the strength of our business model free cash flow was 629 billion and represented 343 of revenue during 2021 we returned 441 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases over the same period our dividend represented 62 of free cash flow underscoring its sustainability 

details of financial results – 2021 compared with 2020 

revenue of 1834 billion increased 388 billion or 27 due to higher revenue from analog and to a lesser extent embedded processing 

gross profit of 1238 billion was up 311 billion or 34 primarily due to higher revenue as a percentage of revenue gross profit increased to 675 from 641 

operating expenses rd and sga were 322 billion compared with 315 billion 

acquisition charges were 142 million compared with 198 million and were noncash 

restructuring chargesother was 54 million due to integration charges at our lehi utah manufacturing facility partially offset by gains on sales of assets compared with 24 million due to an embedded processing action in 2020 

operating profit was 896 billion or 488 of revenue compared with 589 billion or 408 of revenue 

other income and expense oie was 143 million of income compared with 313 million of income which decreased primarily due to lower royalty income see note 11 to the financial statements 

our provision for income taxes was 115 billion compared with 422 million this increase was due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2020 which included a 249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciationrelated uncertain tax position 

our annual operating tax rate which does not include discrete tax items was 14 in both periods we use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate our effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items was 13 in 2021 compared with 7 in 2020 see note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us statutory corporate tax rate to our effective tax rate 

net income was 777 billion compared with 560 billion eps was 826 compared with 597 

segment results – 2021 compared with 2020 

analog includes power and signal chain product lines 

analog revenue increased in both product lines led by signal chain operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit 

embedded processing includes microcontrollers and processors 

embedded processing revenue increased operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit 

other includes dlp ® products calculators and custom asic products 

 includes acquisition charges and restructuring chargesother 

other revenue increased 240 million and operating profit increased 154 million 

financial condition 

at the end of 2021 total cash cash and cash equivalents plus shortterm investments was 974 billion an increase of 317 billion from the end of 2020 

accounts receivable were 170 billion an increase of 287 million compared with the end of 2020 days sales outstanding at the end of 2021 were 32 compared with 31 at the end of 2020 

inventory was 191 billion a decrease of 45 million from the end of 2020 days of inventory at the end of 2021 were 116 compared with 123 at the end of 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and access to debt markets we also have a variable rate revolving credit facility as of december 31 2021 our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding cash flows from operating activities for 2021 were 876 billion an increase of 262 billion due to higher net income and lower cash used for working capital 

investing activities for 2021 used 410 billion compared with 922 million in 2020 capital expenditures were 246 billion compared with 649 million in 2020 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods including the purchase of our 300millimeter semiconductor factory in lehi utah during 2021 as we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our longterm capacity planning we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than historical levels shortterm investments used cash of 165 billion in 2021 compared with 241 million in 2020 

financing activities for 2021 used 314 billion compared with 455 billion in 2020 in 2021 we received net proceeds of 150 billion from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and retired maturing debt of 550 million in 2020 we received net proceeds of 150 billion from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and retired maturing debt of 500 million dividends paid in 2021 were 389 billion compared with 343 billion in 2020 reflecting an increased dividend rate we used 527 million to repurchase 29 million shares of our common stock compared with 255 billion used in 2020 to repurchase 234 million shares employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of 377 million compared with 470 million in 2020 

we had 463 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 511 billion of shortterm investments as of december 31 2021 we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend and debtrelated payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months 

nongaap financial information 

this mda includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure these are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flows from operating activities also referred to as cash flow from operations 

we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity our cashgenerating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders as well as insight into our financial performance these nongaap measures are supplemental to the comparable gaap measures 

reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures is provided in the table below 

this mda also includes references to an annual operating tax rate a nongaap term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate a gaap measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items we believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items 

critical accounting estimates 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 2 the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes however based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements we consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment 

income taxes 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws and significant judgment is necessary to i determine whether based on the technical merits a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and ii measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 

as part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require adjustments to the valuation allowances and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

inventory valuation allowances 

inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials work in process and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance such as an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors 

commitments and contingencies 

see note 10 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign exchange risk 

the us dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies and exchange rate fluctuations in those jurisdictions may impact our effective tax rate 

our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts which are based on yearend 2021 balances and currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately 1 million 

we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures as of december 31 2021 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 313 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 127 million to sell japanese yen 82 million to sell british pounds and 42 million to sell euros similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2020 

interest rate risk 

we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates i the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and ii the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt 

as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by about 15 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 715 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debt 

equity risk 

longterm investments at yearend 2021 include the following 

• investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements the mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments 

• investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships accounted for under either the equity method or at cost with adjustments to observable market changes or impairments 

• equity investments – includes nonmarketable nonpublicly traded equity securities 

investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities nonmarketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method see note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other longterm investments 

we also utilize total return swaps to economically hedge exposure to changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements with employees gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps generally offset the related losses or gains on the deferred compensation liabilities

 item 1 business 

we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world our operations began in 1930 and we are incorporated in delaware with headquarters in dallas texas we have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries our two reportable segments are analog and embedded processing and we report the results of our remaining business activities in other in 2020 we generated 1446 billion of revenue 

for decades we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors we were pioneers in the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits as each generation became more reliable more affordable and lower in power semiconductors were used by a growing number of customers and markets this passion is alive today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications particularly in industrial and automotive markets 

for many years we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind first we will act like owners who will own the company for decades second we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing and third we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor when we are successful in achieving these ambitions our employees customers communities and shareholders all win 

as engineers we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innovate to create a better world technology is the foundation of our company but ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate longterm value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share 

our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements 

the first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitive advantages this business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made over the years and that continue today the four sustainable competitive advantages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products the reach of our market channels and diversity and longevity of our products markets and customer positions in combination these four competitive advantages provide tangible benefits are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers together these competitive advantages help position ti in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners we make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages 

the second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital this spans how we select rd projects develop new capabilities like ticom invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners over a 10year period from 2011 to 2020 we allocated 83 billion which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation the largest allocation over this period was to drive organic growth which includes investments in rd sales and marketing capital expenditures and working capital for inventory beyond that we also allocated capital to dividends and share repurchases dividends are designed to appeal to a broad set of investors and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretive capture of future free cash flow for longterm investors lastly we allocate to acquisitions for inorganic growth which we last did in 2011 when we acquired national semiconductor 

the third element of our strategy is efficiency which we think of as constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent this is about getting our investments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of longterm free cash flow per share it is not just about optimizing costcutting to get to the last dollar of expense we bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improvement to all areas of the company and this focus on efficiency contributes to revenue growth improved gross margins disciplined rd and sga expense free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth 

we believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets ti apart from our peers and will for a long time to come we will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies finally we will remain focused on the belief that longterm growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value 

product information 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as “chips” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit we have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes approximately 80000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results 

analog 

our analog segment generated 1089 billion of revenue in 2020 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting distributing storing discharging isolating and measuring electrical energy whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery as the digitization of electronics continues there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings the real world and other electronic devices our analog products are used in many markets particularly industrial automotive and personal electronics 

sales of our analog products generated about 75 of our revenue in 2020 

our analog segment includes the following major product lines power and signal chain 

power 

power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems in all end markets our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels including batterymanagement solutions dcdc switching regulators acdc and isolated controllers and converters power switches linear regulators voltage supervisors voltage references and lighting products 

signal chain 

signal chain includes products that sense condition and measure realworld signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control our signal chain products which serve a variety of end markets include amplifiers data converters interface products motor drives clocks logic and sensing products 

embedded processing 

our embedded processing segment generated 257 billion of revenue in 2020 embedded processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment they are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application our devices vary from simple lowcost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices such as motor control our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotive 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next 

sales of embedded processing products generated about 18 of our revenue in 2020 

our embedded processing segment includes microcontrollers digital signal processors dsps and applications processors microcontrollers are selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors are designed for specific computing activity 

other 

we report the results of our remaining business activities in other which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments other generated 101 billion of revenue in 2020 and includes revenue from dlp ® products primarily used to project highdefinition images calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics 

in other we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments examples of these items include acquisition charges restructuring charges and certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions 

markets for our products 

the table below lists the major markets for our products in 2020 and the estimated percentage of our 2020 revenue that the market represented the chart also lists in declining order of our revenue the sectors within each market 



market characteristics 

competitive landscape 

despite recent consolidation the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia 

we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and reach of its channels to market technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities in addition manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle a semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

we employ several strategies which have many benefits including dampening the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti as an example we are focused on building closer direct relationships with customers when it comes to market cycles these relationships provide improved insight into customer demand and allow us to more accurately and efficiently manage factory loadings and inventory levels which lead to more stable lead times and higher product availability finally we focus our resources on analog and embedded processing products and industrial and automotive markets generally our products serve a large and diverse customer base which reduces our dependence on the performance of any single product market or customer in addition they typically have long shelf lives and low risk of obsolescence industrial and automotive markets also benefit from long product life cycles with revenue often lasting 10 years or more which help to smooth the impact of cyclicality 

seasonality 

our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation historically our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters 

customers sales and distribution 

we sell our products to over 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with more than onethird of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100 

we market and sell our products through direct sales channels including our website and broad sales and applications team and through distributors over the past several years we have been investing in new capabilities and evolving our distribution network to better align with our strategy to establish closer direct relationships with our customers with less business flowing through the distribution channel we require fewer distributors during 2020 we completed our transition to a single worldwide distributor coupled with a few regionspecific distributors for order fulfillment building closer direct customer relationships strengthens our reach of market channel advantage which gives us access to more customers and more of their design projects leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design additionally broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs 

our investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and ecommerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services 

manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities 

we invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing inhouse this strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage delivers tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain we have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300millimeter capacity an unpackaged chip built on 300millimeter wafers costs about 40 less than an unpackaged chip built on 200millimeter wafers to strengthen this advantage construction is underway on our new 300millimeter wafer fabrication facility in richardson texas as 300millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our analog growth 

we assess and are careful to address potential health safety and environmental risks presented by our operations including our manufacturing operations we care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials controlling harmful emissions and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances 

we expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2020 we sourced about 20 of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 of our assemblytest services from subcontractors 

inventory 

our objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service maintain stable and competitive lead times minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization to meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand we build ahead of demand our broadbased products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from solesource suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have license agreements which vary in duration involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti a company with broad international operations like many companies we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results dividends or share repurchases and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

risks related to our business and industry 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition is uncertain 

the global spread of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sarscov2 and the coronavirus disease covid19 has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption both nearterm and potentially longterm we have modified and might further modify our business practices in response to the covid19 pandemic related thirdparty responses including from government authorities and our suppliers customers and distributors and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which ti operates the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to affect our business results of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including the duration and scope of the pandemic government social business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic and the effect of the pandemic on short and longterm general economic conditions we might experience short or longterm constrained supply or volatility in customer demand which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results in future periods 

our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political social economic or other conditions 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries about 90 of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states shipments of products to chinabased customers represent about 20 of our revenue certain countries where we operate have experienced and other countries may experience trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs import or export restrictions trade embargoes and sanctions restrictions on crossborder investment and other trade barriers trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into china cause chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results 

we are exposed to political social and economic conditions security risks terrorism or other hostile acts health conditions and epidemics labor conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate in addition our global operations expose us to periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment these actions in conjunction with trade tensions may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively certain competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows our results of operations may be adversely affected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments changes in demand for customer products or trade restrictions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets natural events epidemics or domestic or international political social economic or other conditions breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions and if inaccurate could cause us to hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems 

breaches disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses system failures restricted network access unauthorized access terrorism employee malfeasance or human error these events could among other things compromise our information technology networks result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in the release of personal data or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection remediation regulatory inquiries or penalties or claims for damages any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers vendors and other third parties are frequent and constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them 

our ability to successfully implement strategic business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

from time to time we undertake strategic business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our objectives if we do not successfully implement these changes our business plans and operating results could be adversely affected we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth cost savings or other benefits of strategic business and organizational changes and charges associated with these actions could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations as listed in the properties section in item 2 may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products 

rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a timely and costeffective manner we make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products develop new products to meet changing customer demands and improve our production processes in some cases we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured further projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed 

we face supply chain and manufacturing risks 

we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a costeffective and timely manner our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers’ operations as a result of for example quality excursions uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets domestic or international political social economic and other conditions natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate or limited or delayed access to key raw materials natural resources and utilities additionally a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

in particular our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree 

our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have longterm contracts with all of these suppliers and the number of alternate suppliers is limited reliance on these suppliers involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely costeffective and appropriate manner the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property 

our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims product liability claims product recalls or legal proceedings 

claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures or other grounds relating to our products manufacturing services designs communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a claim we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a ti part for example with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory 

we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance 

in 2020 about half of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business 

our margins vary 

our profit margins vary due to a number of factors which may include customer demand and shipment volume our manufacturing processes product mix inventory levels tariffs freight costs and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards in addition we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel as well as the effective management of succession for key employees skilled and experienced personnel in our industry including engineering management marketing technical and staff personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws 

legal and regulatory risks 

our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject 

we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example the environment and climate change safety and health trade bribery and corruption financial reporting tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition market access epidemics intellectual property ownership and infringement and the movement of currency compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business if we do not comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business 

some of these complex laws rules and regulations – for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resources or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate if our tax rate increases our results of operations could be adversely affected a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions changes in available tax credits or deductions including for amounts relating to stock compensation changes in applicable tax rates changes in tariff regulations or surcharges changes in accounting principles or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation changes in these laws and regulations including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax expense will change 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business there can be no assurance that as our business evolves we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on technology from others for which a license is required there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such a license at all or on terms we consider reasonable we directly and indirectly face infringement claims from third parties including nonpracticing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies we also face infringement claims where we or our customers make use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable these assertions whether or not of any merit expose us to claims for damages andor injunctions from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights however our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information including for example third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 

increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans including the actual return on plan assets discount rates plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding cash flow and results of operations and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions 

risks related to our financing activities and other risks 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including our other risk factors many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise might be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders or could cause us to raise funds by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling assets 

our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted 

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world technology is the foundation of our company but ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate longterm value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share 

our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements 

1 a great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages the four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits 

i a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain 

ii a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments 

iii the reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs 

iv diversity and longevity of our products markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments 

together these competitive advantages help position ti in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners we make our investments with an eye towards longterm strengthening and leveraging of these advantages 

2 discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities this spans how we select rd projects develop new capabilities like ticom invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners 

3 efficiency which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent 

we believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets ti apart from our peers and will for a long time to come we will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies finally we will remain focused on the belief that longterm growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operations 

• our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results during 2020 we reorganized the product lines within our analog segment to simplify our business structure into our power and signal chain product lines these changes had no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial statements or on our reportable segment results see note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments 

• when we discuss our results 

◦ unless otherwise noted changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes 

◦ new products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products 

◦ from time to time our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higherpriced or lowerpriced products which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped 

◦ because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand 

• for an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate” see the nongaap financial information section 

• all dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of us dollars 

our results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2020 and 2019 and yeartoyear comparisons between 2020 and 2019 discussion of 2018 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this form 10k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 

impact of covid19 

the coronavirus covid19 pandemic and its followon effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact business activity across industries worldwide including ti therefore we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years 

the impact to our lead times and ability to fulfill orders was minimal in 2020 however depending on pandemicrelated factors like the potential of local manufacturing restrictions on our factories we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders in future periods the coronavirus pandemic remains dynamic with uncertainty around its duration and broader impact we continue to monitor and assess the situation and address implications to our business supply chain and customer demand 

we have long had a business continuity plan in place for unforeseeable situations like we have seen with covid19 additionally over the past several years we have invested in building inventory and expanding our global internally owned manufacturing footprint investing in these capabilities has given us flexibility such as the ability to build products across multiple manufacturing sites these investments have helped to minimize disruptions but may not be sufficient to eliminate them 

results of operations 

our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets industrial automotive personal electronics communications equipment enterprise systems and other while all end markets represent good opportunities we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets which we believe represent the best growth opportunities gross margin of 641 reflected the quality of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy including the benefit of 300millimeter analog production 

our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations our cash flow from operations of 614 billion underscored the strength of our business model free cash flow was 549 billion and represented 380 of revenue during 2020 consistent with our commitment to return free cash flow to owners we returned 598 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases our dividend represented 62 of free cash flow underscoring its sustainability 

details of financial results – 2020 compared with 2019 

revenue of 1446 billion increased 78 million or 1 primarily due to higher revenue from analog partially offset by lower revenue from embedded processing 

gross profit of 927 billion was up 105 million or 1 due to higher revenue and increased factory loadings as a percentage of revenue gross profit increased to 641 from 637 

operating expenses rd and sga were 315 billion compared with 319 billion 

acquisition charges were 198 million compared with 288 million and were noncash see note 7 to the financial statements 

restructuring chargesother was a charge of 24 million due to an embedded processing action compared with a credit of 36 million due to the sale of our manufacturing facility in greenock scotland in 2019 

operating profit was 589 billion or 408 of revenue compared with 572 billion or 398 of revenue 

other income and expense oie was 313 million of income compared with 175 million of income which increased primarily due to higher royalty income see note 12 to the financial statements 

interest and debt expense of 190 million increased 20 million due to the issuance of additional longterm debt 

our provision for income taxes was 422 million compared with 711 million the decrease was due to higher discrete tax benefits which included a 249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciationrelated uncertain tax position and to a lesser extent higher us tax benefits partially offset by higher income before income taxes 

our annual operating tax rate which does not include discrete tax items was 14 compared with 16 in 2019 we use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate our effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items was 7 in 2020 compared with 12 in 2019 see note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us statutory corporate tax rate to our effective tax rate 

net income was 560 billion compared with 502 billion eps was 597 compared with 524

financial condition 

at the end of 2020 total cash cash and cash equivalents plus shortterm investments was 657 billion an increase of 118 billion from the end of 2019 

accounts receivable were 141 billion an increase of 340 million compared with the end of 2019 days sales outstanding at the end of 2020 were 31 compared with 29 at the end of 2019 

inventory was 196 billion a decrease of 46 million from the end of 2019 days of inventory at the end of 2020 were 123 compared with 144 at the end of 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and a variable rate revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2020 were 614 billion a decrease of 510 million primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital partially offset by higher net income 

our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investmentgrade banks and allows us to borrow up to 2 billion until march 2024 this credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper as of december 31 2020 our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding 

investing activities for 2020 used 922 million compared with 192 billion in 2019 capital expenditures were 649 million compared with 847 million in 2019 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods shortterm investments used cash of 241 million in 2020 compared with 114 billion in 2019 

financing activities for 2020 used 455 billion compared with 473 billion in 2019 in 2020 we received net proceeds of 150 billion from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and retired maturing debt of 500 million in 2019 we received net proceeds of 149 billion from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and retired maturing debt of 750 million dividends paid in 2020 were 343 billion compared with 301 billion in 2019 reflecting an increase in the dividend rate partially offset by fewer shares outstanding we used 255 billion to repurchase 234 million shares of our common stock compared with 296 billion used in 2019 to repurchase 274 million shares employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of 470 million compared with 539 million in 2019 

we had 311 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 346 billion of shortterm investments as of december 31 2020 we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend and debtrelated payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months 

nongaap financial information 

this mda includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure these are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flows from operating activities also referred to as cash flow from operations 

we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity our cashgenerating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders as well as insight into our financial performance these nongaap measures are supplemental to the comparable gaap measures 

reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures is provided in the table below 



this mda also includes references to an annual operating tax rate a nongaap term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate a gaap measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items we believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items 

longterm contractual obligations 



a principal and related interest payments for our longterm debt obligations including amounts classified as the current portion of longterm debt 

b includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed noncancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule excludes cancellable arrangements see note 11 to the financial statements 

c includes payments for the onetime transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the 2017 enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act 

d includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases see note 10 to the financial statements 

e estimated payments for certain liabilities that existed as of december 31 2020 

f excludes 89 million of uncertain tax liabilities under asc 740 as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans we plan to contribute about 10 million in 2021 but funding projections beyond 2021 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance interest rates and potential us and nonus legislation 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 2 the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes however based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements we consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment 

income taxes 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws and significant judgment is necessary to i determine whether based on the technical merits a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and ii measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 

as part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

inventory valuation allowances 

inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials work in process and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance such as an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors 

changes in accounting standards 

see note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding the status of new accounting and reporting standards 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

commitments and contingencies 

see note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign exchange risk 

the us dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently impact our effective tax rate 

our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts which are based on yearend 2020 balances and currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately 3 million 

we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures as of december 31 2020 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 416 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 147 million to sell japanese yen 85 million to sell euros and 82 million to sell british pounds similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2019 

interest rate risk 

we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates i the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and ii the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt 

as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by about 9 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 650 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debt 

equity risk 

longterm investments at yearend 2020 include the following 

• investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements the mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments 

• investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as nonmarketable equity securities 

• equity investments – includes nonmarketable nonpublicly traded equity securities 

investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities nonmarketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method see note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other longterm investments 

we also utilize total return swaps to economically hedge exposure to changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements with employees gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps generally offset the related losses or gains on the deferred compensation liabilities

 item 1 business 

we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world our operations began in 1930 and we are incorporated in delaware with headquarters in dallas texas we have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries our two reportable segments are analog and embedded processing and we report the results of our remaining business activities in other in 2019 we generated 1438 billion of revenue 

for many years we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind first we will act like owners who will own the company for decades second we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing and third we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor when we are successful in achieving these ambitions our employees customers communities and shareholders all win 

our business model is designed around four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe in combination put us in a unique class of companies these advantages include i a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology ii a broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing products iii reach of market channels including our sales force and ticom and iv diversity and longevity of our products markets and customer positions our strategic focus and where we invest the majority of our resources is on analog and embedded processing with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets we believe these markets represent the best growth opportunities over the next decade or longer due to increasing semiconductor content additionally analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles intrinsic diversity and less capitalintensive manufacturing which we believe offer stability profitability and strong cash generation 

this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth especially on a pershare basis is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term we also believe that free cash flow cash flow from operations less capital expenditures will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders ti’s business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders 

the combined effect of our ambitions business model and sustainable competitive advantages is that we have continued to build a stronger company over time we have gained market share in analog and embedded processing and grown and returned all free cash flow to our owners 

product information 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as “chips” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit we have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results 

analog 

our analog segment generated 1022 billion of revenue in 2019 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting distributing storing discharging isolating and measuring electrical energy whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery our analog products are used in many markets particularly industrial automotive and personal electronics 

sales of our analog products generated about 71 of our revenue in 2019 according to external sources the market for analog semiconductors was about 54 billion in 2019 our analog segment’s revenue in 2019 was about 19 of this fragmented market which is the leading position we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

our analog segment includes the following major product lines power signal chain and high volume 

power 

power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels using battery management solutions portable components power supply controls pointofload products switches and interfaces integrated protection devices highvoltage products and mobile lighting and display products 

signal chain 

signal chain includes products that sense condition and measure realworld signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control our signal chain products which serve a variety of end markets include amplifiers data converters interface products motor drives clocks and sensing products 

high volume 

high volume includes integrated analog and standard products that are primarily sold into markets such as personal electronics industrial and automotive these products support applications like displays and automotive safety systems 

embedded processing 

our embedded processing segment generated 294 billion of revenue in 2019 embedded processing products are the “brains” of many types of electronic equipment embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application our devices vary from simple lowcost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems adas our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotive 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next 

sales of embedded processing products generated about 20 of our revenue in 2019 according to external sources the market for embedded processors was about 18 billion in 2019 our embedded processing segment’s revenue in 2019 was about 16 of this fragmented market which is among the leaders we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

our embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines connected microcontrollers and processors 

connected microcontrollers 

connected microcontrollers includes microcontrollers microcontrollers with integrated wireless capabilities and standalone wireless connectivity solutions microcontrollers are selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment 

processors 

processors includes digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors are designed for specific computing activity 

other 

we report the results of our remaining business activities in other which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments other generated 122 billion of revenue in 2019 and includes revenue from dlp ® products primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics 

in other we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments examples of these items include acquisition charges restructuring charges and certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance settlements and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions 

markets for our products 

the table below lists the major markets for our products in 2019 and the estimated percentage of our 2019 revenue that the market represented the chart also lists in declining order of our revenue the sectors within each market 



market characteristics 

competitive landscape 

despite recent consolidation the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate 

we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and depth of its channels to market technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability manufacturing capacity and capabilities and price in addition manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products 

product cycle 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

we employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we focus our resources on analog and embedded processing products and industrial and automotive markets these products and markets serve a large and diverse customer base which reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers industrial and automotive markets also benefit from long product life cycles which help to smooth the impact of cyclicality in addition we plan manufacturing facility and equipment expansion ahead of demand as well as utilize consignment inventory programs to give us improved insight into customer demand and more accurately manage factory loadings 

seasonality 

our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation historically our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters 

customers sales and distribution 

we sell our products to about 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with more than onethird of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100 

we market and sell our products through direct sales channels including our broad sales force and our website and through distributors in 2019 about 65 of our sales were fulfilled through our distributors and they maintain inventory of our products 

over the past several years we have been investing in new capabilities and evolving our distribution network to better align with our strategy to establish closer more direct relationships with our customers closer direct customer relationships give us better insight into customer needs and allow us to provide better service and greater assurance of supply among other benefits as we expand these direct customer relationships over the next several years we will have less business flowing through the distribution channel and therefore will require fewer distributors 

our investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and ecommerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services 

manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities with most products requiring about two to three months for completion 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation 

we invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing inhouse this strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products we have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300millimeter capacity which has about a 40 cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200millimeter to strengthen this advantage we are moving forward with our plan to build our new 300millimeter wafer fabrication facility in richardson texas as 300millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our analog growth 

we expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand we use the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2019 we sourced about 20 of our total wafers from external foundries most of which support our embedded processing segment and about 40 of our assemblytest services from subcontractors 

inventory 

our objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service and stable lead times minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization to meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand we build ahead of demand longlived lowvolume products and maintain inventory of other products that have a broad customer base and low risk of obsolescence further we have improved insight into demand and are better able to manage our factory loadings because over time we have increased consignment inventory programs and are building closer more direct relationships with our customers in 2019 about 65 of ti revenue was fulfilled from consignment programs our strategy and expected customer demand will cause our inventory levels to fluctuate over time 

backlog 

we define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations further our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery ie when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory our backlog of orders was 10 billion at december 31 2019 and 15 billion at december 31 2018 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from solesource suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have license agreements which vary in duration involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti a company with broad international operations like many companies we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results dividends or share repurchases and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political social economic or other conditions 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries about 85 of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states shipments of products into china represent a large portion of our revenue certain countries where we operate have experienced and other countries may experience increasing protectionism that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs import or export restrictions trade embargoes and sanctions restrictions on crossborder investment and other trade barriers this protectionism impacts our ability to deliver products and product support into china could cause chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results 

we are exposed to political social and economic conditions security risks terrorism or other hostile acts health conditions labor conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate in addition our global operations expose us to periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment these actions in conjunction with trade tensions may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively certain competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows our results of operations may be adversely affected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments or trade restrictions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets natural events or domestic or international political social economic or other conditions breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems 

breaches disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses system failures restricted network access unauthorized access terrorism employee malfeasance or human error these events could among other things compromise our information technology networks result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in the release of personal data or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection remediation regulatory inquiries or penalties or claims for damages any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers vendors and other third parties are frequent and constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them 

our ability to successfully implement strategic business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

from time to time we undertake strategic business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth cost savings or other benefits of strategic business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations as listed in item 2 properties may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products 

rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a timely manner we make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products develop new products to meet changing customer demands and improve our production processes in some cases we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured further projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed 

we face supply chain and manufacturing risks 

we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a costeffective and timely manner our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers’ operations as a result of for example quality excursions uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets domestic or international political social economic and other conditions natural events or health epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate or limited or delayed access to key raw materials natural resources and utilities additionally a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

in particular our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree 

our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have longterm contracts with all of these suppliers and the number of alternate suppliers is limited reliance on these suppliers involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property 

our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims product liability claims product recalls or legal proceedings 

claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures or other grounds relating to our products manufacturing services designs communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a claim we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a ti part for example with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation 

our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject 

we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example the environment safety and health trade bribery and corruption financial reporting tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition market access intellectual property ownership and infringement and the movement of currency compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business 

some of these complex laws rules and regulations – for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resources or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate if our tax rate increases our results of operations could be adversely affected a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions changes in available tax credits or deductions including for amounts relating to stock compensation changes in applicable tax rates changes in tariff regulations or surcharges changes in accounting principles or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation changes in these laws and regulations including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax expense will change 

our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory 

we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance 

in 2019 about 65 of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us disputes with significant distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business 

our margins vary 

our profit margins vary due to a number of factors which may include customer demand and shipment volume our manufacturing processes product mix inventory levels tariffs and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards in addition we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business there can be no assurance that as our business evolves we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable we directly or indirectly face infringement claims from third parties including nonpracticing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies we also face infringement claims where we or our customers make use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable these assertions whether or not of any merit expose us to claims for damages andor injunctions from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights however our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information including for example third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including our other risk factors many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders or could cause us to raise funds by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling assets 

our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted 

increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans including the actual return on plan assets discount rates plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding cash flow and results of operations and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel as well as the effective management of succession for key employees skilled and experienced personnel in our industry including engineering management marketing technical and staff personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws 

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world for many years we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind first we will act like owners who will own the company for decades second we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing and third we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor when we are successful in achieving these ambitions our employees customers communities and shareholders all win 

our business model is designed around the following four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe in combination put us in a unique class of companies 

• a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology we invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing inhouse this strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products we have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300millimeter capacity which has about a 40 cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200millimeter to strengthen this advantage we are moving forward with our plan to build our new 300millimeter wafer fabrication facility in richardson texas as 300millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our analog growth 

• broad portfolio   of differentiated analog and embedded processing products our customers need multiple chips for their systems the breadth of our portfolio means we can meet more of these needs than our competitors can which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system we invest more than 1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio which includes tens of thousands of products   

• reach of market channels customers often begin their initial product selection process and designin journey on our website and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors’ websites our web presence and global sales and applications team are advantages that give us unique access and insight to about 100000 customers designing ti semiconductors into their end products   

• diversity and longevity of our products markets and customer positions together the attributes above result in diverse and longlived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders because of the breadth of our portfolio we are not dependent on any single product customer technology or market some of our products generate revenue for decades which strengthens the return on our investments 

our strategic focus and where we invest the majority of our resources is on analog and embedded processing with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets we believe these markets represent the best growth opportunities over the next decade or longer due to increasing semiconductor content additionally analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles intrinsic diversity and less capitalintensive manufacturing which we believe offer stability profitability and strong cash generation 

this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth especially on a pershare basis is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term we also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders 

the combined effect of our ambitions business model and sustainable competitive advantages is that we have continued to build a stronger company over time we have gained market share in analog and embedded processing and grown and returned all free cash flow to our owners 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operations 

• our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results see note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments 

• when we discuss our results 

◦ unless otherwise noted changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes 

◦ new products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products 

◦ from time to time our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higherpriced or lowerpriced products which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped 

◦ because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand 

• all dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of us dollars 

our results of operations discussed below provides details of our financial results for 2019 and 2018 and yeartoyear comparisons between 2019 and 2018 discussion of 2017 items and yeartoyear comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this form 10k can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of the company’s annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018 

results of operations 

in 2019 we continued our focus on analog and embedded processing products and the industrial and automotive markets together these products and markets represent highly diverse opportunities with thousands of applications and longterm growth potential gross margin of 637 reflected the quality of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy including the benefit of 300millimeter analog production 

our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations our cash flow from operations of 665 billion underscored the strength of our business model free cash flow was 580 billion and represented 403 of revenue up from 384 a year ago during 2019 we returned 597 billion to shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends our strategy is to return all free cash flow to shareholders our dividends represented 52 of free cash flow underscoring their sustainability for an explanation of free cash flow see the nongaap financial information section 

details of financial results – 2019 compared with 2018 

revenue of 1438 billion decreased 140 billion or 9 primarily due to lower revenue from embedded processing and analog 

gross profit of 916 billion was down 111 billion or 11 primarily due to lower revenue as a percentage of revenue gross profit decreased to 637 from 651 

operating expenses rd and sga were 319 billion compared with 324 billion 

acquisition charges of 288 million were noncash see note 7 to the financial statements 

restructuring chargesother was a credit of 36 million due to the sale of our manufacturing facility in greenock scotland 

operating profit was 572 billion or 398 of revenue compared with 671 billion or 425 of revenue 

other income and expense oie was 175 million of income compared with 98 million of income see note 12 to the financial statements 

interest and debt expense of 170 million increased 45 million due to the issuance of additional longterm debt 

our provision for income taxes was 711 million compared with 111 billion the decrease was due to lower income before income taxes and a lower annual operating tax rate our annual operating tax rate which does not include discrete tax items was 16 compared with 20 in 2018 we use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate as explained further in the nongaap financial information section 

our effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items was 12 in 2019 compared with 17 in 2018 see note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate 

net income was 502 billion compared with 558 billion eps was 524 compared with 559 

segment results – 2019 compared with 2018 

analog includes power signal chain and high volume product lines 



analog revenue decreased due to power high volume and to a lesser extent signal chain operating profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and associated gross profit 

embedded processing includes connected microcontrollers and processors product lines 



embedded processing revenue decreased in both product lines led by processors operating profit decreased due to lower revenue and associated gross profit 

other includes dlp ® products calculators and custom asic products 



 includes acquisition charges and restructuring chargesother 

other revenue decreased 212 million and operating profit decreased 60 million 

financial condition 

at the end of 2019 total cash cash and cash equivalents plus shortterm investments was 539 billion an increase of 115 billion from the end of 2018 

accounts receivable were 107 billion a decrease of 133 million compared with the end of 2018 days sales outstanding were 29 at the end of both 2019 and 2018 

inventory was 200 billion a decrease of 216 million from the end of 2018 days of inventory at the end of 2019 were 144 compared with 152 at the end of 2018 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and a variable rate revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2019 were 665 billion a decrease of 540 million primarily due to lower net income 

our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investmentgrade banks and allows us to borrow up to 2 billion until march 2024 this credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper as of december 31 2019 our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding 

investing activities for 2019 used 192 billion compared with 78 million in 2018 capital expenditures were 847 million compared with 113 billion in 2018 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods shortterm investments used cash of 114 billion in 2019 and provided cash proceeds of 107 billion in 2018 

financing activities for 2019 used 473 billion compared with 633 billion in 2018 in 2019 we received net proceeds of 149 billion from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and retired maturing debt of 750 million in 2018 we received net proceeds of 150 billion from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and retired maturing debt of 500 million dividends paid in 2019 were 301 billion compared with 256 billion in 2018 reflecting an increase in the dividend rate partially offset by fewer shares outstanding we used 296 billion to repurchase 274 million shares of our common stock compared with 510 billion used in 2018 to repurchase 495 million shares employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of 539 million compared with 373 million in 2018 

we had 244 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 295 billion of shortterm investments as of december 31 2019 we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend and debtrelated payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months 

nongaap financial information 

this mda includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure these are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flows from operating activities also referred to as cash flow from operations 

we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity our cashgenerating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders as well as insight into our financial performance these nongaap measures are supplemental to the comparable gaap measures 

reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap measures is provided in the table below 



this mda also includes references to an annual operating tax rate a nongaap term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate a gaap measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items we believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items 

longterm contractual obligations 



a principal and related interest payments for our longterm debt obligations including amounts classified as the current portion of longterm debt 

b includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed noncancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule excludes cancellable arrangements see note 11 to the financial statements 

c includes payments for the onetime transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the 2017 enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act see note 4 to the financial statements 

d includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases see note 10 to the financial statements 

e estimated payments for certain liabilities that existed as of december 31 2019 

f excludes 303 million of uncertain tax liabilities under asc 740 as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans we plan to contribute about 20 million in 2020 but funding projections beyond 2020 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance interest rates and potential us and nonus legislation 

critical accounting policies 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 2 the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes however based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements we consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment 

revenue recognition 

based on management’s assessment of the revenue recognition criteria we generally recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon shipment or delivery to the distributors for our consignment arrangements with distributors delivery occurs and revenue is recognized when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations recognition is not contingent upon resale of the products to the distributors’ customers in either scenario 

revenue is recognized net of allowances which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances are not material and generally include special pricing arrangements product returns due to quality issues and incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities 

allowances are based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner 

income taxes 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws and significant judgment is necessary to i determine whether based on the technical merits a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and ii measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 

as part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made 

inventory valuation allowances 

inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials workinprocess and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and workinprocess based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance such as an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors 

changes in accounting standards 

see note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding the status of new accounting and reporting standards 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019 we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk 

commitments and contingencies 

see note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign exchange risk 

the us dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently impact our effective tax rate 

our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts based on yearend 2019 balances and currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than 1 million 

we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures as of december 31 2019 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 458 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 136 million to sell japanese yen 106 million to sell indian rupees and 74 million to sell british pounds similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2018 

interest rate risk 

we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates i the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and ii the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt 

as of december 31 2019 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by about 8 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 532 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debt 

equity risk 

longterm investments at yearend 2019 include the following 

• investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements the mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments 

• investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as nonmarketable equity securities 

• equity investments – includes nonmarketable nonpublicly traded equity securities 

investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 increase or decrease in the investments’ fair values would not materially affect operating results nonmarketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method see note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other longterm investments

business

tableend

 

we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries we have two reportable segments analog and embedded processing we report the results of our remaining business activities in other in 2018 we generated 1578 billion of revenue

our business model is designed around four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe in combination put us in a unique class of companies these advantages include 1 a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology 2 a broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing products 3 the broadest reach of market channels and 4 diversity and longevity of our products markets and customer positions our strategic focus and where we invest the majority of our resources is on analog and embedded processing with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets which we believe represent the best growth opportunities analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles intrinsic diversity and less capitalintensive manufacturing which we believe offer stability profitability and strong cash generation this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth especially on a pershare basis is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term we also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures

the combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in analog and embedded processing and have grown and returned free cash flow ti’s business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders

product information

 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as “chips” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit we have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment

 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results

 

analog 

 

our analog segment generated 1080 billion of revenue in 2018 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting distributing storing discharging isolating and measuring electrical energy whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or running off a battery our analog products are used in many markets particularly industrial automotive and personal electronics

sales of our analog products generated about 68 percent of our revenue in 2018 according to external sources the market for analog semiconductors was about 59 billion in 2018 our analog segment’s revenue in 2018 was about 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time

our analog segment includes the following major product lines power signal chain and high volume

power

 

power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels using battery management solutions portable components power supply controls pointofload products switches and interfaces integrated protection devices highvoltage products and mobile lighting and display products

 

signal chain 

 

signal chain includes products that sense condition and measure realworld signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control our signal chain products which serve a variety of end markets include amplifiers data converters interface products motor drives clocks and sensing products

 

high volume

 

high volume includes integrated analog and standard products that are primarily sold into markets such as personal electronics industrial and automotive these products support applications like displays and automotive safety systems

 

embedded processing 

 

our embedded processing segment generated 355 billion of revenue in 2018 embedded processing products are the “brains” of many types of electronic equipment embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application our devices vary from simple lowcost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems adas our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotive

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next 

sales of embedded processing products generated about 23 percent of our revenue in 2018 according to external sources the market for embedded processors was about 21 billion in 2018 our embedded processing segment’s revenue in 2018 was about 18 percent of this fragmented market among the leaders we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

our embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines connected microcontrollers and processors

 

connected microcontrollers

 

connected microcontrollers includes microcontrollers microcontrollers with integrated wireless capabilities and standalone wireless connectivity solutions microcontrollers are selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory program length and software complexity our products are used in a wide range of applications and incorporate both wired and wireless communication with integrated analog functions to enable electronic equipment to sense connect log and transfer data

 

processors

 

processors includes digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors are designed for specific computing activity  

 

other 

 

we report the results of our remaining business activities in other which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments other generated 143 billion of revenue in 2018 and includes revenue from dlp ® products primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics

in other we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments examples of these items include acquisition charges restructuring charges and certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance settlements and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions 

markets for our products 

 

the table below lists the major markets for our products in 2018 and the estimated percentage of our 2018 revenue that the market represented the chart also lists in declining order of our revenue the sectors within each market

 



market characteristics 

competitive landscape 

 

despite recent consolidation the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and depth of its channels to market technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability capacity and price in addition manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance are a competitive factor for our analog products and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products

 

product cycle 

 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature

 

market cycle 

 

the “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities

 

we employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we plan manufacturing facility and equipment expansion ahead of demand we focus our resources on our analog and embedded processing segments which serve diverse markets and diverse customers this diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers additionally we utilize consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors that give us improved insight into customer demand 

 

seasonality 

 

our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation historically our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters

 

customers sales and distribution

 

we sell our products to about 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with more than onethird of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100

 

we market and sell our products through direct sales channels including our broad sales force and our website and through distributors about 65 percent of our sales are fulfilled through our distributors and they maintain inventory of our products

 

in order to provide high service levels for our customers over the last several years we have been investing to have a closer direct relationship with a large diverse customer base our investments in new and improved capabilities include website and ecommerce enhancements for demand creation as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services

manufacturing 

 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities with most products requiring 6 to 14 weeks for completion

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation

we invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing inhouse this strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products we have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300millimeter capacity which has about a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200millimeter to strengthen this advantage we are planning our next phase of 300millimeter capacity expansion as 300millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our analog growth

we expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand we use the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2018 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 percent of our assemblytest services from subcontractors

inventory

 

our longterm inventory strategy is to maintain high levels of customer service and stable lead times minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization to capitalize on manufacturing efficiencies we build in advance of demand lowvolume longlived devices with a broad customer base and a low risk of obsolescence additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand further we have improved insight into demand and are better able to manage our factory loadings because over time we have increased consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors about 65 percent of ti revenue is fulfilled from consignment programs our strategy and expected customer demand will cause our inventory levels to fluctuate over time 

 

longer term we expect to carry more inventory than we have in the past as we move towards higher consignment levels and more longlived lowvolume devices to serve industrial customers a growing portion of our business

 

backlog

 

we define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations further our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery ie when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory our backlog of orders was 145 billion at december 31 2018 and 132 billion at december 31 2017

raw materials

 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from solesource suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future

 

intellectual property

 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have license agreements which vary in duration involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license

 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti a company with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to any potential downturn associated with increasing protectionism trade tensions and macroeconomic weakness  including any potential downturn associated with the pending withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union these may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do n ot meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results dividends or share repurchases and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment these actions may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies certain competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively additionally traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows our results of operations may be adversely affected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets natural events or domestic or international political social economic or other conditions breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political social economic or other conditions 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue we are exposed to political social and economic conditions security risks terrorism or other hostile acts health conditions labor conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate additionally certain countries where we operate have experienced and other countries may experience increasing protectionism that may impact global trade including tariffs import or export restrictions trade embargoes and sanctions restrictions on crossborder investment and other trade barriers this could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results in addition our global operations expose us to periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches or disruptions of information technology systems 

breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems or the systems of our customers vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses system failures restricted network access unauthorized access terrorism employee malfeasance or human error these events could among other things compromise our information technology networks result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in the release of personal data or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection remediation regulatory inquiries or penalties any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation cybersecurity threats are frequent and constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition

rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products 

rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a timely manner we make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products develop new products to meet changing customer demands and improve our production processes in some cases we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured further projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed 

we face supply chain and manufacturing risks 

we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a costeffective and timely manner our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers’ operations as a result of for example quality excursions uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets domestic or international political social economic and other conditions natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate or limited or delayed access to key raw materials natural resources and utilities additionally a breach of our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology

in particular our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree

our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a po rtion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have longterm contracts with all of these suppliers and the number o f alternate suppliers is limited reliance on these suppliers involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us 

our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims product liability claims product recalls or legal proceedings 

claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures or other grounds relating to our products manufacturing services designs communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a ti part for example with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and reputation

our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject 

we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example the environment safety and health exports and imports bribery and corruption tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition market access intellectual property ownership and infringement and the movement of currency compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business 

some of these complex laws rules and regulations – for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resources or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate if our tax rate increases our results of operations could be adversely affected a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions changes in available tax credits or deductions including for amounts relating to stock compensation changes in applicable tax rates changes in tariff regulations or surcharges changes in accounting principles or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction these laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation changes in these laws and regulations including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax expense will change

if in the future we repatriate any of our earnings represented by noncash operating assets such as inventory and fixed assets we might incur incremental nonus taxes which could affect our results of operations

our results of operations and financial condition could be advers ely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory 

we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed

our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance 

in 2018 about 65 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us disputes with or the loss of significant distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our current business

our margins may vary over time 

our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume obsolescence of our inventory shifts in our product mix changes in tariffs changes in our manufacturing processes and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards in addition we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a result

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business there can be no assurance that as our business evolves we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable we may directly or indirectly face infringement claims from third parties including nonpracticing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies we may also face infringement claims where we or our customers make use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable these assertions whether or not of any merit could expose us to claims for damages andor injunctions from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims

we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights however our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information including for example third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including our other risk factors many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders or could cause us to raise funds by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling assets

our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted 

increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans including the actual return on plan assets discount rates plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding cash flow and results of operations and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel as well as the effective management of succession for key employees skilled and experienced personnel in our industry including engineering management marketing technical and staff personnel are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws

our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

from time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

management’s discuss ion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview

we design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world our business model is designed around the following four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe in combination put us in a unique class of companies 









our strategic focus and where we invest the majority of our resources is on analog and embedded processing with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets which we believe represent the best growth opportunities analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles intrinsic diversity and less capitalintensive manufacturing which we believe offer stability profitability and strong cash generation this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth especially on a pershare basis is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term we also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders

the combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in analog and embedded processing and have grown free cash flow our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operations



















results of operations

we continued to perform well in 2018 even as the year ended with a semiconductor market slowdown we focus on analog and embedded processing with an emphasis on the industrial and automotive markets because these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have longterm growth opportunities gross margin of 651 percent reflected the quality of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy including the benefit of 300millimeter analog production

our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations our cash flow from operations of 719 billion underscored the strength of our business model free cash flow was 606 billion and represented 384 percent of revenue up from 312 percent a year ago during 2018 we returned 766 billion to shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends our strategy is to return all free cash flow to shareholders our dividends represented 42 percent of free cash flow underscoring their sustainability free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure see the nongaap financial information section

details of financial results – 2018 compared with 2017 

revenue of 1578 billion increased 823 million or 6 percent primarily due to higher revenue from analog embedded processing also grew

gross profit of 1028 billion was up 663 million or 7 percent due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs as a percentage of revenue gross profit increased to 651 percent from 643 percent

operating expenses rd and sga were 324 billion compared with 320 billion

acquisition charges of 318 million were noncash see note 8 to the financial statements

operating profit was 671 billion or 425 percent of revenue compared with 608 billion or 407 percent of revenue

other income and expense oie was 98 million of income compared with 75 million of income see note 13 to the financial statements

interest and debt expense of 125 million increased 47 million due to the issuance of additional longterm debt

our provision for income taxes was 111 billion compared with 240 billion which includes a discrete tax benefit of 198 million in 2018 and a discrete tax expense of 540 million in 2017 the decrease in our tax provision was due to the enactment of the tax act in 2017 which included a reduction in the statutory tax rate in 2018 and the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings recorded in 2017 the benefits of the tax act in 2018 were partially offset by higher income before income taxes our effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items was 17 percent in 2018 compared with 39 percent in 2017 see note 5 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate

net income was 558 billion compared with 368 billion eps was 559 compared with 361

segment results – 2018 compared with 2017 

analog includes power signal chain and high volume product lines



analog revenue increased due to power and to a lesser extent signal chain partially offset by a decline in high volume operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit

embedded processing includes connected microcontrollers and processors product lines



embedded processing revenue increased due to connected microcontrollers processors revenue was about even operating profit increased primarily due to higher gross profit

other includes dlp ® products calculators and custom asic products



other revenue decreased by 134 million and operating profit decreased by 73 million

details of financial results – 2017 compared with 2016 

revenue of 1496 billion was up 159 billion or 12 percent from 2016 due to higher revenue from analog and embedded processing 

gross profit of 961 billion was up 136 billion or 16 percent primarily due to higher revenue as a percentage of revenue gross profit increased to 643 percent from 618 percent

operating expenses were 320 billion compared with 310 billion as we allocated resources from manufacturing support and sga into rd activities

acquisition charges of 318 million were noncash

restructuring chargesother was a charge of 11 million compared with a credit of 15 million in 2016 these amounts are included in other for segment reporting purposes see note 12 to the financial statements

operating profit was 608 billion or 407 percent of revenue compared with 486 billion or 363 percent of revenue 

oie was 75 million of income compared with 155 million of income in 2016

our provision for income taxes was 240 billion compared with 134 billion the increase was due to the enactment of the tax act and to a lesser extent higher income before income taxes our effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items was 39 percent in 2017 compared with 27 percent in 2016

net income was 368 billion compared with 360 billion eps was 361 compared with 348 

segment results – 2017 compared with 2016 

analog



analog revenue increased due to power and signal chain high volume also grew but to a lesser extent operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit

embedded processing



embedded processing revenue increased due to growth in both product lines led by processors operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit

other



other revenue decreased by 248 million primarily due to custom asic products and the recognition of royalties in oie instead of revenue which began in the first quarter of 2017 operating profit decreased by 150 million

financial condition

at the end of 2018 total cash cash and cash equivalents plus shortterm investments was 423 billion a decrease of 236 million from the end of 2017 

accounts receivable were 121 billion a decrease of 71 million compared with the end of 2017 days sales outstanding at the end of 2018 were 29 compared with 31 at the end of 2017 

inventory was 222 billion an increase of 260 million from the end of 2017 days of inventory at the end of 2018 were 152 compared with 134 at the end of 2017

liquidity and capital resources

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and a variable rate revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2018 were 719 billion an increase of 183 billion from 2017 this increase was due to higher net income which benefited from a lower effective tax rate

our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investmentgrade banks and allows us to borrow up to 2 billion until march 2023 this credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper as of december 31 2018 our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding

investing activities for 2018 used 78 million compared with 113 billion in 2017 capital expenditures were 113 billion compared with 695 million in 2017 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods we had sales of shortterm investments net of purchases that provided cash proceeds of 107 billion compared with purchases of shortterm investments net of sales that used cash of 460 million in 2017 we received 9 million from asset sales compared with 40 million in 2017

financing activities for 2018 used 633 billion compared with 373 billion in 2017 in 2018 we received net proceeds of 150 billion from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and retired maturing debt of 500 million in 2017 we received net proceeds of  110 billion from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and retired maturing debt of 625 million dividends paid in 2018 were 256 billion compared with 210 billion in 2017 reflecting an increase in the dividend rate partially offset by fewer sh ares outstanding we used 510 billion to repurchase 495 million shares of our common stock compared with 256 billion used in 2017 to repurchase 306 million shares employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of 373 million compared wi th 483 million in 2017 

 

we had 244 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 180 billion of shortterm investments as of december 31 2018 we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend and debtrelated payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months

nongaap financial information

this mda includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure these are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flows from operating activities also referred to as cash flow from operations 

we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity our cashgenerating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders as well as insight into our financial performance these nongaap measures are supplemental to the comparable gaap measures 

reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaapbased measures is provided in the table below

 



this mda also includes references to an annual operating tax rate a nongaap term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate a gaap measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items we believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items

longterm contractual obligations 

 















critical accounting policies

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 2 the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes however based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements we consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment 

revenue recognition 

based on management’s assessment of the revenue recognition criteria we usually recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon shipment or delivery to the distributors for our consignment arrangements with distributors delivery occurs when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations recognition is not contingent upon resale of the products to the distributors’ customers in either scenario

revenue is recognized net of allowances which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances are not material and generally include special pricing arrangements product returns due to quality issues and incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities 

allowances are based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner

income taxes 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in the ordinary course of global business th ere may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given th at the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 

as part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future years our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made also our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain nonus operations could change such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years

inventory valuation allowances 

inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials workinprocess and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and workinprocess based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance examples are an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

foreign exchange risk

the us dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently impact our effective tax rate 

our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts based on yearend 2018 balances and currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of about 3 million

we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures for example at yearend 2018 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 525 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 160 million to sell japanese yen 99 million to sell euros and 94 million to sell indian rupees similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2017 

interest rate risk

we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates 1 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and 2 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt 

as of december 31 2018 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by about 4 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 330 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debt

equity risk

longterm investments at yearend 2018 include the following 







investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments’ fair values would not materially affect operating results nonmarketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method see note 7 to the financial statements for details of equity and other longterm investments

disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of ti’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of ti’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

internal control over financial reporting 

report by management on internal control over financial reporting

 

the management of ti is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting ti’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements issued for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2018 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

ti management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria in internal control − integrated framework based on our assessment we believe that as of december 31 2018 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the coso criteria

business

tableend

 

we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries we have two reportable segments analog and embedded processing we report the results of our remaining business activities in other in 2017 we generated 1496 billion of revenue

 

our business model is designed around four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe in combination put us in a unique class of companies these advantages include 1 a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology 2 a broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing products 3 the broadest reach of market channels and 4 diversity and longevity of our products markets and customer positions our strategic focus and where we invest the majority of our resources is on analog and embedded processing with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets which we believe represent the best growth opportunities analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles intrinsic diversity and less capitalintensive manufacturing which we believe offer stability profitability and strong cash generation this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth especially on a pershare basis is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term we also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures

 

the combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in analog and embedded processing and have grown and returned free cash flow ti’s business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders

 

product information

 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as “chips” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit we have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment

 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results in 2017 we reorganized the product lines within our segments to align our business structure with the way our customers select and buy products

 

analog 

 

our analog segment generated 990 billion of revenue in 2017 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting distributing storing discharging isolating and measuring electrical energy whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or running off a battery our analog products are used in many markets particularly industrial automotive and personal electronics

 

sales of our analog products generated about 66 percent of our revenue in 2017 according to external sources the market for analog semiconductors was about 53 billion in 2017 our analog segment’s revenue in 2017 was about 19 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time

 

our analog segment includes the following major product lines power signal chain and high volume

 

power 

 

power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels using battery management solutions portable components power supply controls pointofload products switches and interfaces integrated protection devices highvoltage products and mobile lighting and display products

 

signal chain

 

signal chain includes products that sense condition and measure realworld signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control our signal chain products which serve a variety of end markets include amplifiers data converters interface products motor drives clocks and sensing products

 

high volume

 

high volume includes integrated analog and standard products that are primarily sold into markets such as personal electronics industrial and automotive these products support applications like touch screens and automotive safety systems

 

embedded processing 

 

our embedded processing segment generated 350 billion of revenue in 2017 embedded processing products are the “brains” of many types of electronic equipment embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application our devices vary from simple lowcost microcontrollers used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems adas our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotive

 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next 

 

sales of embedded processing products generated about 23 percent of our revenue in 2017 according to external sources the market for embedded processors was about 20 billion in 2017 our embedded processing segment’s revenue in 2017 was about 18 percent of this fragmented market among the leaders we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

 

our embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines connected microcontrollers and processors

 

connected microcontrollers

 

connected microcontrollers includes microcontrollers microcontrollers with integrated wireless capabilities and standalone wireless connectivity solutions microcontrollers are selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory program length and software complexity our products are used in a wide range of applications and incorporate both wired and wireless communication with integrated analog functions to enable electronic equipment to sense connect log and transfer data

 

processors

 

processors includes digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors are designed for specific computing activity  

 

other 

 

we report the results of our remaining business activities in other which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments other generated 156 billion of revenue in 2017 and includes revenue from dlp ® products primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics

 

in other we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments examples of these items include acquisition charges restructuring charges and certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance settlements and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions 

 

financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in note 1 to the financial statements which is included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” risks attendant to our foreign operations are described in item 1a “risk factors”

markets for our products 

 

the table below lists the major markets for our products in 2017 and the estimated percentage of our 2017 revenue that the market represented the chart also lists in declining order of our revenue the sectors within each market

 



 

market characteristics 

competitive landscape 

 

despite recent consolidation the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and depth of its channels to market technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability capacity and price in addition manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance are a competitive factor for our analog products and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products

 

product cycle 

 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature

 

market cycle 

 

the “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities

 

we employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we acquire our manufacturing facilities and equipment ahead of demand which usually allows us to acquire this capacity at lower costs we focus our resources on our analog and embedded processing segments which serve diverse markets and diverse customers this diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers additionally we utilize consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors that give us improved insight into customer demand 

 

seasonality 

 

our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation historically our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters

 

customers sales and distribution

 

we sell our products to about 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with more than onethird of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100

 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through direct sales and distributors and online we have sales or marketing offices in more than 30 countries and we continue to expand and enhance our online presence about 65 percent of our sales are fulfilled through distribution channels our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors

 

manufacturing

 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products being completed within 6 to 14 weeks

 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and asse mblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation 

 

we do most of our manufacturing inhouse this strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products we have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by increasing factory loadings of our advanced analog 300millimeter wafers which have about a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200millimeter wafers 300millimeter wafers will support the majority of our analog growth going forward

 

additionally we keep our manufacturing costs low by using mature assets acquired ahead of demand when their prices are most attractive we expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand we use the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2017 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 percent of our assemblytest services from subcontractors

 

research and development

 

our rd expense was 151 billion in 2017 compared with 136 billion in 2016 and 127 billion in 2015 we continually grow and strengthen our broad analog and embedded processing portfolios through disciplined allocation of rd resources we invest in rd to develop differentiated products with a particular emphasis on designing for the industrial and automotive markets

 

we conduct most of our rd internally we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology

 

inventory

 

our longterm inventory strategy is to maintain high levels of customer service and stable lead times minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization to capitalize on manufacturing efficiencies we build in advance of demand lowvolume longlived devices with a broad customer base and a low risk of obsolescence additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand further we have improved insight into demand and are better able to manage our factory loadings because over time we have increased consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors about 60 percent of ti revenue is fulfilled from consignment programs our strategy and expected customer demand will cause our inventory levels to fluctuate over time 

 

longer term we expect to carry more inventory than we have in the past as we move towards higher consignment levels and more longlived lowvolume devices to serve industrial customers a growing portion of our business

 

backlog

 

we define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations further our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery ie when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory our backlog of orders was 132 billion at december 31 2017 and 109 billion at december 31 2016

 

raw materials

 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future

 

intellectual property 

 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have license agreements which vary in duration involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license

 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms

 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram

 

acquisitions and divestitures

 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures we focus on transactions that are a strategic fit and strengthen our portfolio and that also meet our financial objectives

 item 1a 

risk factors

tableend

 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti a company with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment these actions may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies certain competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively additionally traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

 

changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows our results of operations may be adversely affected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets natural events or domestic or international political social economic or other conditions breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity

 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

our global operations subject us to risks associate d with domestic or international political social economic or other conditions 

 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue we are exposed to political social and economic conditions security risks terrorism or other hostile acts health conditions labor conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate including the united states additionally certain countries where we operate have experienced and other countries may experience increasing protectionism that may impact global trade this could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results in addition our global operations expose us to periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches or disruptions of information technology systems 

 

breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems or the systems of our customers vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses system failures restricted network access unauthorized access terrorism employee malfeasance or human error these events could among other things compromise our information technology networks result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in the release of personal data or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection remediation or penalties any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation cybersecurity threats are frequent and constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them 

 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate 

 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition

 

rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products 

 

rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a timely manner we make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products and develop new ones to meet changing customer demands in some cases we might not realize a return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured further projects that are commercially viable may not contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed

 

we face supply chain and manufacturing risks 

 

we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a costeffective and timely manner our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers’ operations as a result of for example quality excursions uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets domestic or international political social economic and other conditions natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate or limited or delayed access to key raw materials natural resources and utilities additionally a breach of our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology

 

in particular our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree

 

our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assem bly and testing of our products and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have longterm contracts with all of these suppliers and the number of alternate suppliers is limited relian ce on these suppliers involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and th e possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us 

 

our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject 

 

we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example the environment safety and health exports and imports bribery and corruption tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition market access intellectual property ownership and infringement and the movement of currency compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business

 

some of these complex laws rules and regulations – for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resources or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost

 

our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims product liability claims product recalls or legal proceedings 

 

we could be subject to claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures or other grounds relating to our products manufacturing services designs communications or cybersecurity that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part for example with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and our reputation

 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions changes in available tax credits changes in applicable tax rates changes in tariff regulations or surcharges changes in accounting principles or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations if our tax rate increases our results of operations could be adversely affected

 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development’s base erosion and profit shifting recommendations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change

 

our initial estimates of the financial impact of the us tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 may change as we refine our analysis and as additional guidance becomes available if in the future we repatriate any of the earnings represented by noncash operating assets such as inventory and fixed assets we might incur incremental nonus taxes which could affect our results of operations

 

our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory 

 

we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance 

 

in 2017 about 65 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us disputes with or the loss of a significant number of distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our current business

 

our margins may vary over time 

 

our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume obsolescence of our inventory shifts in our product mix changes in tariffs changes in our manufacturing processes and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards in addition we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a result

 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation 

 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business there can be no assurance that as our business evolves we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights or that we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable we may directly or indirectly face infringement claims from third parties including nonpracticing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies we may also face infringement claims where we or our customers make use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable these assertions whether or not of any merit could expose us to claims for damages andor injunctions from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims

 

we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights however our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information including for example third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws

 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including our other risk factors many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders or could cause us to raise funds by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling assets

 

our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted

 

increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans including the actual return on plan assets discount rates plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding cash flow and results of operations and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions

 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including engineering management marketing technical and staff personnel skilled and experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws

 

our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

 

from time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations 

 

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

management’s discuss ion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview

we design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world our business model is designed around the following four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe in combination put us in a unique class of companies 









our strategic focus and where we invest the majority of our resources is on analog and embedded processing with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets which we believe represent the best growth opportunities analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles intrinsic diversity and less capitalintensive manufacturing which we believe offer stability profitability and strong cash generation this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth especially on a per share basis is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term we also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders

the combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in analog and embedded processing and have grown free cash flow our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operations























results of operations

we continued to perform well in 2017 reflecting our focus on analog and embedded processing with a particular emphasis on the industrial and automotive markets  these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have longterm growth opportunities in 2017 analog and embedded processing represented 90 percent of revenue gross margin of 643 percent reflected the quality of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy

our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations our cash flow from operations of 536 billion underscored the strength of our business model free cash flow was 467 billion and represented 312 percent of revenue up from 305 percent a year ago during 2017 we returned 466 billion to shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends consistent with our strategy to return all of our free cash flow to shareholders our dividends represented 45 percent of free cash flow underscoring their sustainability free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure see the nongaap financial information section

details of financial results – 2017 compared with 2016 

revenue of 1496 billion was up 159 billion or 12 percent due to higher revenue from analog and embedded processing 

gross profit of 961 billion was up 136 billion or 16 percent primarily due to higher revenue as a percentage of revenue gross profit increased to 643 percent from 618 percent 

operating expenses rd and sga were 320 billion compared with 310 billion as we continued our ongoing allocation of resources to rd activities

acquisition charges of 318 million were noncash see note 13 to the financial statements

oie was 75 million of income compared with 155 million in 2016 see note 13 to the financial statements 

our provision for income taxes was  240 billion compare d with  134 billion  the increase was due to the enactment of the tax act and to a lesser extent higher income before income taxes our effective tax rate which includes discrete t ax items was 39 percent in 2017 and 27 percent in 2016 this change was due to tax adjustments made in 2017 as a result of the tax act see note 6 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate 

net income was 368 billion compared with 360 billion eps was 361 compared with 348

segment results – 2017 compared with 2016 

analog includes power signal chain and high volume product lines

 



analog revenue increased due to power and signal chain high volume also grew but to a lesser extent operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit

embedded processing includes connected microcontrollers and processors product lines

 



embedded processing revenue increased due to growth in both product lines led by processors operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit

other includes dlp ® products calculators and custom asic products

 



other revenue declined 248 million primarily due to custom asic products and the move of royalties from revenue to oie which began in the first quarter of 2017 operating profit decreased 150 million 

details of financial results – 2016 compared with 2015 

revenue of 1337 billion was up 370 million or 3 percent from 2015 due to higher revenue from embedded processing and analog

operating expenses were 136 billion for rd and 174 billion for sga rd expense increased 89 million or 7 percent due to a combination of our allocation of resources into rd activities and higher compensationrelated costs sga expense increased 14 million primarily due to higher compensationrelated costs

acquisition charges associated with our 2011 acquisition of national semiconductor were 319 million compared with 329 million these noncash charges resulted from the amortization of intangible assets see note 13 to the financial statements

segment results – 2016 compared with 2015 

analog

 



analog revenue increased due to power and signal chain while high volume declined operating profit increased due to higher gross profit which benefited from lower manufacturing costs

embedded processing

 



embedded processing revenue increased due to processors and to a lesser extent connected microcontrollers processors revenue increased due to the mix of products shipped operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit

other

 



other revenue decreased due to in declining order royalties custom asic products and calculators this decrease was partially offset by growth in dlp products operating profit decreased 12 million

financial condition

at the end of 2017 total cash cash and cash equivalents plus shortterm investments was 447 billion an increase of 979 million from the end of 2016 

accounts receivable were 128 billion at the end of 2017 an increase of 11 million compared with the end of 2016 days sales outstanding at the end of 2017 were 31 compared with 33 at the end of 2016 

inventory was  196 billion at the end of 2017  an increase of  167 million from the end of 2016  days of inventory at the end of 2017 were 134 compared with 126 at the end of 2016  

liquidity and capital resources

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and a variable rate revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2017 was 536 billion an increase of 749 million from 2016 that was driven by an increase in income before income taxes

our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investmentgrade banks and allows us to borrow up to 2 billion until march 2022 this credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper as of december 31 2017 our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding 

in 2017 investing activities used 113 billion compared with 650 million in 2016 for 2017 capital expenditures were 695 million compared with 531 million in 2016 capital expenditures in both periods were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in 2017 we had purchases of shortterm investments net of sales that used cash of 460 million compared with 113 million in 2016 in 2017 we received 40 million from asset sales compared with none in 2016 

in 2017 financing activities used 373 billion compared with 381 billion in 2016 in 2017 we received net proceeds of 110 billion from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and repaid 625 million of maturing debt in 2016 we received net proceeds of 499 million from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt and repaid 100 billion of maturing debt dividends paid in 2017 were 210 billion compared with 165 billion in 2016 during 2017 the quarterly dividend increased to 062 from 050 per share resulting in an annualized dividend payment of 248 per share during 2016 we increased our quarterly dividend to 050 from 038 per share in 2017 we used 256 billion to repurchase 306 million shares of our common stock this compared with 213 billion used in 2016 to repurchase 355 million shares in 2017 employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of 483 million compared with 472 million in 2016

we had 166 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 281 billion of shortterm investments as of december 31 2017 with our us entities owning about 80 percent of these amounts combined at the end of 2017 we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend and debtrelated payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months 

in 2017 we recorded a provisional tax liability of 690 million on indefinitely reinvested earnings of our nonus subsidiaries related to the enactment of the tax act this amount will be paid over eight years and is not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity

nongaap financial information 

this mda includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure these are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flows from operating activities also referred to as cash flow from operations 

we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity our cashgenerating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders as well as insight into our financial performance these nongaap measures are supplemental to the comparable gaap measures 

reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaapbased measures is provided in the table below

 



this mda also includes references to an annual operating tax rate a nongaap term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate a gaap measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items we believe the term annual operating tax rate more clearly communicates that discrete tax items are excluded from such rate the term also helps differentiate from the effective tax rate which includes discrete tax items no adjustments are made to the estimated annual effective tax rate when using the term annual operating tax rate 

longterm contractual obligations 

 















critical acco unting policies 

our accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements as disclosed in note 2 the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes however based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements we consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment 

revenue recognition 

based on management’s assessment of the revenue recognition criteria we usually recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon shipment or delivery to the distributors for our consignment arrangements with distributors delivery occurs when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations recognition is not contingent upon resale of the products to the distributors’ customers in either scenario

revenue is recognized net of allowances which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances are not material and generally include special pricing arrangements product returns due to quality issues and incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities 

allowances are based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner

income taxes 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals

as part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future years our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made also our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain nonus operations could change such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years

inventory valuation allowances 

inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials workinprocess and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and workinprocess based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance examples are an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

foreign exchange risk

the us dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently on our effective tax rate 

our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts based on yearend 2017 balances and currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of about 6 million

we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures for example at yearend 2017 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 365 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 140 million to sell japanese yen 59 million to sell british pound sterling and 49 million to sell euros similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2016 

interest rate risk

we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates 1 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and 2 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt 

as of december 31 2017 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by 8 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 141 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debt

equity risk

longterm investments at yearend 2017 include the following 







investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments fair values would not materially affect operating results nonmarketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost impairments deemed to be otherthantemporary are expensed in net income investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method see note 8 to the financial statements for details of equity and other longterm investments

business

tableend

 

we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries we have two reportable segments analog and embedded processing we report the results of our remaining business activities in other in 2016 we generated 1337 billion of revenue

 

we focus our resources on analog and embedded processing because we believe that these segments’ long product life cycles intrinsic diversity and need for less capitalintensive manufacturing provide a combination of stability profitability and strong cash generation this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term we also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures

 

product information

 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as “chips” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit we have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment

 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segment follows

 

analog 

 

analog generated 854 billion of revenue in 2016 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting distributing storing discharging isolating and measuring electrical energy whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or running off a battery our analog products are used in many markets particularly personal electronics and industrial 

 

sales of our analog products generated about 64 percent of our revenue in 2016 according to external sources the market for analog semiconductors was about 48 billion in 2016 our analog segment’s revenue in 2016 was about 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time

 

in 2016 our analog segment included the following major product lines high volume analog  logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog sva

 

hval

hval included highvolume integrated products that support applications like automotive safety systems touchscreen controllers lowvoltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllers

 

power

power included products that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio of power products is designed to manage power requirements using battery management solutions portable power components power supply controls and pointofload products

 

 

hpa 

hpa included products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of end products hpa products included highspeed data converters amplifiers sensors highreliability products interface products and precision products that are typically used in systems that require high performance hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years

 

sva

sva included a broad portfolio of industrial highvoltage power management data converter interface and operational amplifier products used in manufacturing a wide range of electronic systems sva products support applications like video and data interface products high voltage power conversion and mobile lighting and display systems sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years sva consisted primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation in 2011

 

embedded processing 

 

embedded processing generated 302 billion of revenue in 2016 embedded processing products are the “brains” of many types of electronic equipment embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application our devices vary from simple lowcost microcontrollers used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems adas our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial automotive and communications equipment

 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next 

 

sales of embedded processing products generated about 23 percent of our revenue in 2016 according to external sources the market for embedded processors was about 18 billion in 2016 our embedded processing segment’s revenue in 2016 was about 17 percent of this fragmented market among the leaders we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

 

in 2016 our embedded processing segment included the following major product lines processors microcontrollers and connectivity

 

processors

processors included digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors are designed for specific computing activity

 

microcontrollers

microcontrollers included selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length with no operating system and low software complexity analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers

 

connectivity

connectivity included products that enable electronic equipment to connect and transfer data wirelessly with the requirements for speed data capability distance power and security varying depending on the application our connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements including lowpower wireless network standards like sub1ghz zigbee® and other technologies like bluetooth® and wifi

 

 

other 

 

we report the results of our remaining business activities in other which included operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments other generated 181 billion of revenue in 2016 and included revenue from dlp® products primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images calculators certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and royalties received from agreements involving license rights to our patent portfolio 

 

in other we also included items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments examples of these items include acquisition charges restructuring charges and certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance settlements and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions 

 

financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in note 1 to the financial statements which is included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” risks attendant to our foreign operations are described in item 1a “risk factors”

 

markets for our products 

the table below lists the major markets that used our products in 2016 and the estimated percentage of our 2016 revenue that the market represented the chart also lists in declining order of our revenue the sectors within each market

 



 

 

market characteristics 

competitive landscape 

despite recent consolidation the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and depth of its channels to market technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets the installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a product’s performance integration and power characteristics

 

product cycle 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature  

 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities

 

we employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we acquire our manufacturing facilities and equipment ahead of demand which usually allows us to acquire this capacity at lower costs we focus our resources on our analog and embedded processing segments which serve diverse markets and diverse customers this diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers additionally we utilize consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors that give us improved insight into customer demand 

 

seasonality 

our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation historically our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters

 

manufacturing

 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 7 to 15 weeks

 

the cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as some of our processor products

 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation we own much of our manufacturing capacity therefore a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed and changes in factory loadings can cause shortterm variations in profit margins when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase our operating focus is more on 

 

maximizing longterm free cash flow than minimizing shortterm variations in profit margins caused by factory loadings to this end we seek to maximize longterm free cash flow by k eeping capital expenditures low through opportunistic purchases of facilities and equipment ahead of demand 

 

we expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2016 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 percent of our assemblytest services from subcontractors

 

customers

 

we estimate that we sell our products to about 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with more than onethird of our revenue deriving from customers outside our largest 100

 

sales and distribution

 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through direct sales and distributors and online we have sales or marketing offices in more than 30 countries and we continue to expand our online presence about 60 percent of our sales are fulfilled through distribution channels our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors

 

inventory

 

our inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand we carry proportionally more inventory of products with long life cycles and a broad customer base additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand

 

about 60 percent of ti revenue is fulfilled from consignment inventory programs that we have in place for our large customers and distributors with these programs we own inventory that is stored at our customers’ and distributors’ locations and we recognize revenue when the product is pulled from consigned inventory these consignment programs give us improved insight into demand allowing us to better manage our factory loadings about 65 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory

 

backlog

 

we define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations further our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery ie when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory our backlog of orders was 109 billion at december 31 2016 and 095 billion at december 31 2015

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments

 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our strategic position we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us

 

raw materials 

 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

 

 

intellectual property 

 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have license agreements which vary in duration involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms

 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram

 

research and development

 

our rd expense was 137 billion in 2016 compared with 128 billion in 2015 and 136 billion in 2014 our primary areas of rd investment are analog and embedded processing products

 

we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology

 item 1a 

risk factors

tableend

 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to ti a company with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example we may face increased competition as a result of china actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment these actions may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively additionally traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

 

rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products 

 

rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products we make significant investments in research and development to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands and we might not realize a return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured further projects that are commercially viable may not contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed 

 

changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or grows at a significantly slower pace than management expects our results of operations may be adversely affected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers including 

 

curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and fi nancial condition 

 

our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets natural events or domestic or international political social economic or other conditions breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity

 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political social economic or other conditions 

 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue we are exposed to political social and economic conditions security risks terrorism or other hostile acts health conditions labor conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate including the united states additionally certain countries where we operate have experienced and other countries may experience increasing protectionism that may impact global trade this could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results in addition our global operations expose us to periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate 

 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition

 

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems 

 

breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems could be caused by computer viruses system failures unauthorized access sabotage vandalism or terrorism these events could compromise our information technology networks result in lost data or the unauthorized release of our our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in the release of employee personal data or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation

 

we face supply chain and manufacturing risks 

 

we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a costeffective and timely manner our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers’ operations as a result of for example quality excursions uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets domestic or international political social economic and other conditions natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate or limited or delayed access to key raw materials natural resources and utilities additionally a breach of our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology

 

in particular our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree

 

 

our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our p roducts and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have longterm contracts with all of these suppliers and the number of alternate suppliers is limited reliance on these suppliers in volves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of supplie rs’ imposition of increased costs on us 

 

our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject 

 

we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example the environment safety and health exports and imports bribery and corruption tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition and intellectual property ownership and infringement compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business

 

some of these complex laws rules and regulations – for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resources or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost

 

our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims product liability claims product recalls or legal proceedings 

 

we could be subject to claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures or other grounds relating to our products manufacturing services designs or communications that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part for example with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and our reputation

 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate if our tax rate increases our results of operations could be adversely affected a number of factors could cause our taxes to increase including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions changes in available tax credits changes in applicable tax rates changes in tariff regulations or surcharges or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities

 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change

 

we have not made a provision for us income tax on the portion of our undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries that is considered permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we repatriate any of these foreign earnings we might incur incremental us income tax which could affect our results of operations

 

 

our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our in ventory 

 

we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance 

 

in 2016 about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us disputes with or the loss of a significant number of distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our current business

 

our margins may vary over time 

 

our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume obsolescence of our inventory shifts in our product mix and changes in tariffs in addition we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a result

 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation 

 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable we may directly or indirectly face infringement claims from third parties including nonpracticing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies these assertions whether or not of any merit could expose us to claims for damages andor injunctions from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims

 

we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights however our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology including for example third parties’ use of our patented technology in their products without the right to do so or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark moreover the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws

 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including the other risk factors described under item 1a many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders or could cause us to raise funds by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling assets

 

our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted

 

 

increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans including the actual return on plan assets discount rates plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding cash flow and results of operations and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions

 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including engineering management marketing technical and staff personnel skilled and experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws

 

our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

 

from time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations 

 

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview

we design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world   our business model is carefully constructed around the following attributes 









the combined effect of these attributes is that over time we have grown free cash flow and gained market share in analog and embedded processing these attributes put us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operations  















 







results of operations

we continued to perform well in 2016 reflecting our focus on analog and embedded processing these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and we believe have dependable longterm growth opportunities in 2016 analog and embedded processing represented 86 percent of revenue gross margin of 616 percent for the year reflects the quality of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy

our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations in 2016 cash flows from operations were 461 billion up from 440 billion in 2015 free cash flow in 2016 was 305 percent of revenue up from 296 percent a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 2030 percent of revenue during the year we returned 378 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends our dividends represented 40 percent of free cash flow underscoring their sustainability free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure for a reconciliation to gaap and an explanation of the reason for providing this nongaap measure see the nongaap financial information section after the liquidity and capital resources section

details of financial results – 2016 compared with 2015 

revenue of 1337 billion was up 370 million or 3 percent from 2015 due to higher revenue from embedded processing and analog

gross profit was 824 billion an increase of 680 million or 9 percent due to lower manufacturing costs and to a lesser extent higher revenue gross profit margin was 616 percent compared with 582 percent

operating expenses were 137 billion for rd and 177 billion for sga rd expense increased 90 million or 7 percent due to a combination of our ongoing allocation of resources into rd activities and higher compensationrelated costs sga expense increased 19 million primarily due to higher compensationrelated costs

acquisition charges associated with our 2011 acquisition of national semiconductor were 319 million compared with 329 million these noncash charges resulted from the amortization of intangible assets see note 13 to the financial statements

restructuring chargesother was a net credit of 15 million which included a gain on the sale of intellectual property of 40 million that was partially offset by 25 million related to restructuring charges this compared with a net credit of 71 million in 2015 which included gains on sales of assets of 83 million that were partially offset by 12 million related to restructuring charges and other credits these amounts are included in other for segment reporting purposes see note 3 to the financial statements

operating profit was 480 billion or 359 percent of revenue compared with 427 billion or 329 percent of revenue

oie for 2016 was 211 million compared with 32 million the increase is due to income of 188 million from settlements related to intellectual property infringement

our income tax provision was 134 billion compared with 123 billion the increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes partially offset by a tax benefit for stock compensation our effective tax rates were 27 percent in 2016 and 29 percent in 2015 see note 6 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the us statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate

net income was 360 billion an increase of 609 million or 20 percent eps was 348 compared with 282 eps benefited 013 in 2016 due to the application of the new accounting standard related to stock compensation

 

segment results – 2016 compared with 2015 

analog included high volume analog  logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog sva product lines

 



 

analog revenue increased primarily due to sva and hpa power also grew but to a lesser extent while hval declined due to the mix of products shipped operating profit increased due to higher gross profit which benefited from lower manufacturing costs

embedded processing included processors microcontrollers and connectivity product lines

 



 

embedded processing revenue increased due to in declining order processors microcontrollers and connectivity processors revenue increased due to the mix of products shipped operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit

other included dlp products calculators custom asics and royalties

 



 



 

other revenue decreased due to in declining order lower royalties custom asic products and calculators this decrease was partially offset by growth in dlp products operating profit decreased 12 million

prior results of operations

in 2015 analog revenue grew 3 percent and embedded processing revenue grew 2 percent analog and embedded processing represented 86 percent of revenue in 2015 up from 83 percent in 2014 gross margin was 582 percent for 2015

in 2015 cash flows from operations were 440 billion up from 405 billion in 2014 free cash flow in 2015 was 296 percent of revenue up from 281 percent in 2014 during 2015 we returned 419 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends

details of financial results – 2015 compared with 2014 

revenue of 1300 billion was about even with 2014 as higher revenue from analog and embedded processing was offset by lower revenue from other our 2015 revenue was negatively affected by about 150 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates

gross profit was 756 billion an increase of 133 million or 2 percent due to lower manufacturing costs gross profit margin was 582 percent of revenue compared with 569 percent

operating expenses were 128 billion for rd and 175 billion for sga rd expense decreased 78 million or 6 percent and sga decreased 95 million or 5 percent both comparisons reflect savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align costs with growth opportunities including the completed restructuring actions in embedded processing and japan these decreases were partially offset by higher compensationrelated costs

 

acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of national semiconductor and were 329 million about even with 2014 these noncash charges were primarily fr om the amortization of intangible assets 

restructuring chargesother was a net credit of 71 million which included gains on sales of assets of 83 million that were partially offset by 12 million related to restructuring charges and other credits this compared with a net credit of 51 million in 2014 reflecting gains on sales of assets of 75 million that were partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of 24 million these amounts are included in other for segment reporting purposes

operating profit was 427 billion or 329 percent of revenue compared with 395 billion or 303 percent of revenue in 2014

the income tax provision was 123 billion compared with 105 billion the increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and to a lesser extent a lower benefit from nonus effective tax rates our effective tax rate was 29 percent in 2015 and 27 percent in 2014

net income was 299 billion an increase of 165 million or 6 percent from 2014 eps was 282 compared with 257 in 2014

segment results – 2015 compared with 2014 

analog

 



 

analog revenue increased primarily due to hval power and sva also grew but to a lesser extent hpa declined due to the mix of products shipped operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit and to a lesser extent lower manufacturing costs  

embedded processing

 



 

embedded processing revenue increased due about equally to connectivity and microcontrollers which together offset a decline in processors operating profit increased primarily due to lower operating expenses  

other

 



 



 

other revenue declined primarily due to custom asics revenue from dlp products also declined but to a lesser extent operating profit declined primarily due to lower revenue and associated gross profit  

financial condition

at the end of 2016 total cash cash and cash equivalents plus shortterm investments was 349 billion an increase of 272 million from the end of 2015

 

accounts receivable were 127 billion at the end of 2016 this was an increase of 102 million compared with the end of 2015 days sales outstanding were 33 at the end of both 2016 and 2015 

inventory was 179 billion at the end of 2016 this was an increase of 99 million from the end of 2015 days of inventory at the end of 2016 were 126 compared with 115 at the end of 2015

liquidity and capital resources

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and a variable rate revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2016 was 461 billion an increase of 217 million from 2015 primarily due to an increase in net income

our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investmentgrade banks and allows us to borrow up to 2 billion until march 2021 this credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper as of december 31 2016 our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding

in 2016 investing activities used 650 million compared with 302 million in 2015 for 2016 capital expenditures were 531 million compared with 551 million in 2015 capital expenditures in both periods were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in 2016 we had purchases of shortterm investments net of proceeds that used cash of 113 million in comparison in 2015 we had proceeds from shortterm investments net of purchases that provided cash of 125 million in 2015 we received 110 million from asset sales compared with none in 2016

in 2016 financing activities used 381 billion compared with 429 billion in 2015 in 2016 we received proceeds of 499 million from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt net of original issuance discount and repaid 100 billion of maturing debt in 2015 we received proceeds of 498 million from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt net of original issuance discount and repaid 100 billion of maturing debt dividends paid in 2016 were 165 billion compared with 144 billion in 2015 reflecting increases in the dividend rate partially offset by fewer shares outstanding during 2016 the quarterly dividend increased to 050 from 038 per share resulting in an annualized dividend payment of 200 per share during 2015 we increased our quarterly dividend to 038 from 034 per share in 2016 we used 213 billion to repurchase 355 million shares of our common stock this compared with 274 billion used in 2015 to repurchase 514 million shares employee exercises of stock options are also reflected in cash flows from financing activities in 2016 these exercises provided cash proceeds of 472 million compared with 396 million in 2015

we had 115 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 234 billion of shortterm investments as of december 31 2016 with our us entities owning about 80 percent of these amounts combined at the end of 2016 we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend and debtrelated payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months  

nongaap financial information

this mda includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure these are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flows from operating activities also referred to as cash flow from operations we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity our cashgenerating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders as well as insight into our financial performance these nongaap measures are supplemental to the comparable gaap measures reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaapbased measures is provided in the table below

 



 

 

longterm contractual obligations 

 



 











critical accounting policies

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we use statistical analyses estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results we consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a significant effect on our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from sales of our products including sales to our distributors when title and risk of loss pass which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the terms of the sales order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sales amounts are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured for sales to distributors payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products

revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements including consignment arrangements with distributors is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations

we recognize revenue net of allowances which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances which are not material generally include volumebased incentives product returns due to quality issues incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements allowances are based on analysis of historical data current economic conditions and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner

in addition we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging when collection is at risk we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and if necessary will record a charge in the period such determination is made

we recognize in revenue shipping fees if any received from customers we include shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue the majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties

 

income taxes 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense

in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals

as part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future years our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made also our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our nonus operations could change such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years

in addition to the factors described above the estimated annual tax rate which excludes discrete items reflected in forwardlooking statements is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment

inventory valuation allowances 

inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials workinprocess and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and workinprocess based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance examples are an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors

changes in accounting standards

see note 2 to the financial statements for information on new accounting standards

offbalance sheet arrangements

as of december 31 2016 we had no significant offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

foreign exchange risk 

the us dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently on our effective tax rate

 

our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts based on yearend 2016 balances and currency exchang e rates a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss   of about 1 million 

we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures for example at yearend 2016 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 494 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 158 million to sell japanese yen and 123 million to sell euros similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2015 

interest rate risk 

we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates 1 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and 2 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt

as of december 31 2016 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by 7 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 104 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debt

equity risk 

longterm investments at yearend 2016 include the following 







investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments fair values would not materially affect operating results nonmarketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost impairments deemed to be otherthantemporary are expensed in net income investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method see note 8 to the financial statements for details of equity and other longterm investments

an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of ti’s management including its chief executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of ti’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

internal control over financial reporting 

report by management on internal control over financial reporting

the management of ti is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting ti’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements issued for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

ti management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria in internal control − integrated framework based on our assessment we believe that as of december 31 2016 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the coso criteria 

ti’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting which immediately follows this report

texas instruments incorporated

we have audited texas instruments incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 based on criteria established in internal control − integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria texas instruments incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report by management on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

in our opinion texas instruments incorporated maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016 based on the coso criteria

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of texas instruments incorporated and subsidiaries as of december 31 2016 and 2015 and the related consolidated statements of income comprehensive income stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016 and our report dated february 23 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

business

tableend

 

we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries we have two reportable segments analog and embedded processing we report the results of our remaining business activities in other in 2015 we generated 13 billion of revenue

 

we focus our resources on analog and embedded processing because we believe that these segments’ long product life cycles intrinsic diversity and need for less capitalintensive manufacturing provide a combination of stability profitability and strong cash generation this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures

 

product information

 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as “chips” combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit we have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment

 

we sell catalog and applicationspecific standard semiconductor products both of which we market to multiple customers catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release applicationspecific standard products assps are designed for use by a smaller number of customers and are targeted to a specific application the life cycles of assps are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months although some can be used across multiple generations of customers’ products we also sell custom semiconductor products which are designed for a specific customer to use in a specific application and are sold only to that customer the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products that are differentiated from competitors’ products our products are sold through distribution channels and directly to customers

 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segment follows

 

analog 

 

analog generated 83 billion of revenue in 2015 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in every electronic device by converting distributing storing discharging isolating and measuring electrical energy whether the device is plugged into a wall or running off a battery our analog products are used in many markets particularly personal electronics and industrial 

 

sales of our analog products generated about 64 percent of our revenue in 2015 according to external sources the market for analog semiconductors was 45 billion in 2015 our analog segment’s revenue in 2015 was 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time

 

our analog segment includes the following major product lines high volume analog  logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog sva

 

hval

these include highvolume integrated assps and highvolume catalog products hval products support applications like automotive safety devices touchscreen controllers lowvoltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllers

 

 

power 

these include both catalog products and assps that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio of power products is designed to enhance the efficiency of powered devices using battery management solutions portable power devices power supply controls and pointofload products

 

hpa

these include catalog products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products hpa products include highspeed data converters amplifiers sensors highreliability products interface products and precision products that are typically used in systems that require high performance hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years

 

sva

these include a broad portfolio of industrial highvoltage power management data converter interface and operational amplifier catalog products used in manufacturing a wide range of electronic systems sva products support applications like video and data interface products high voltage power conversion and mobile lighting and display systems sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years sva consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation in 2011

 

embedded processing 

 

embedded processing generated 28 billion of revenue in 2015 embedded processing products are the “brains” of many electronic devices embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application the devices vary from simple lowcost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems adas our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotive

 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next 

 

sales of embedded processing products generated about 21 percent of our revenue in 2015 according to external sources the market for embedded processors was 18 billion in 2015 our 15 percent share of this fragmented market is among the leaders we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

 

our embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines microcontrollers processors and connectivity

these include selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length with no operating system and low software complexity analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers

 

processors

these include digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data processors are typically tailored for a specific class of applications such as industrial factory automation or grid infrastructure and automotive infotainment and adas they are also sold into broad industrial applications

 

connectivity

these include products that enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data and the requirements for speed data capability distance power and security vary depending on the application our connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements including lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee® and other technologies like 

 

bluetooth® wifi and gps our connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and micr ocontroller products enabling data to be collected transmitted and acted upon

the table below lists the major markets that used our products in 2015 and the estimated percentage of our 2015 revenue that the market represented the chart also lists in decreasing order of our revenue the sectors within each market

 



 

 

market characteristics 

competitive landscape 

the analog and embedded processing markets are highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate 

 

we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a product’s performance integration and power characteristics

 

product cycle 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature 

 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities

 

we employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we acquire our facilities and equipment ahead of demand which usually allows us to acquire this capacity at lower costs we focus our resources on our analog and embedded processing segments  which serve diverse markets and diverse customers this diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers additionally we utilize consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors 

 

seasonality 

our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation historically our semiconductor revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters

 

manufacturing

 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 7 to 16 weeks

 

the cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as some of our processor products

 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation we own much of our manufacturing capacity therefore a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed and changes in factory loadings can cause shortterm variations in profit margins when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs 

 

are spread over i ncreased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase our operating focus is more on maximizing longterm free cash flow than minimizing shortterm variations in profit margins caused by factory loadings 

 

to this end we seek to maximize longterm free cash flow by keeping capital expenditures low through opportunistic purchases of facilities and equipment ahead of demand for example in 2013 we purchased an assemblytest facility in chengdu china in 2015 we began production at an existing facility in dallas texas that we adapted to manufacture analog products using 300millimeter wafers our most costeffective manufacturing process these activities may have nearterm effects on our profit margins but we believe they will result in longterm benefits to free cash flow

 

we expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2015 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 percent of our assemblytest services from subcontractors

 

customers

 

we estimate that we sell our products to more than 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with onethird of our revenue deriving from customers outside our largest 100 our largest single end customer in 2015 was apple inc apple accounted for approximately 11 percent of revenue recognized primarily in our analog segment

 

sales and distribution

 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force and distributors we have sales or marketing offices in more than 30 countries about 60 percent of our revenue comes through distribution channels our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors

 

inventory

 

our inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand we carry proportionally more inventory of products with long life cycles and a broad customer base additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand

 

we generate about 55 percent of our revenue from consignment inventory programs that we have in place for our large customers and distributors with these programs we own inventory that is stored at our customers’ and distributors’ locations and we recognize revenue when the product is pulled from consigned inventory these consignment programs give us improved insight into demand allowing us to better manage our factory loadings  about 60 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory

 

backlog

 

we define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations further our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery ie when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory our backlog of orders was 095 billion at december 31 2015 and 094 billion at december 31 2014

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments

 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us

 

 

raw materials 

 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

 

intellectual property

 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights to our portfolio and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

our patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business

 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms

 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram dlp ® is another valuable trademark

 

research and development

 

our rd expense was 128 billion in 2015 compared with 136 billion in 2014 and 152 billion in 2013 our primary areas of rd investment are analog and embedded processing products

 

we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology

 item 1a 

risk factors

tableend

 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example the china market is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share additionally we may face increased competition as a result of china’s adoption of policies designed to promote its domestic semiconductor industry certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively additionally traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors

 

rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products 

 

rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products we require significant investments to develop new technologies and products that meet changing customer demands and we might not realize a return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured further projects that are commercially viable may not contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed 

 

changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets if demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or grows at a significantly slower pace than management expects our results of operations may be adversely affected additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

 

our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets natural events or domestic or international political social economic or other conditions breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity

 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

 

our margins may vary over time 

 

our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a result

 

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

 

semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities

our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political social economic or other conditions 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue we are exposed to political social and economic conditions security risks terrorism or other hostile acts health conditions labor conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition

 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate 

 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition

 

we face supply chain and manufacturing risks 

 

we rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a costeffective and timely manner our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected if our suppliers’ operations were disrupted as a result of for example quality excursions uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets domestic or international political social economic and other conditions natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate or limited or delayed access to key raw materials natural resources and utilities additionally a breach of our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information if our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology

 

in particular our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demands that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree

 

 

our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have longterm contracts with all of these suppliers and the number of alternate suppliers is limited reliance on these suppliers involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us

 

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systems 

breaches of our information technology systems could be caused by computer viruses unauthorized access sabotage vandalism or terrorism these breaches could compromise our information technology networks and could result in unauthorized release of our our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in release of employee personal data or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation

 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims

 

we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology moreover the laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws

 

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements

 

our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject 

 

we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example the environment safety and health exports and imports bribery and corruption tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition and intellectual property ownership and infringement compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business

 

some of these complex laws rules and regulations – for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resources or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost

 

 

our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims  product recalls product liability claims or legal proceedings 

 

we could be subject to claims based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failures or other grounds relating to our products manufacturing services designs or communications that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims product recalls or other legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our reputation

 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate if our tax rate increases our results of operations could be adversely affected a number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions changes in available tax credits changes in applicable tax rates or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities

 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change

 

we have not made a provision for us income tax on the portion of our undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries that is considered permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we repatriate any of these foreign earnings we might incur incremental us income tax which could affect our results of operations

 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance 

 

in 2015 about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us 

 

our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory 

 

we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed

 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including the other risk factors described under item 1a many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders or could cause us to raise funds by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling assets 

 

 

our results of operations an d liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted

 

increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans including the actual return on plan assets discount rates plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding cash flow and results of operations and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions

 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require

 

our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

 

from time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations 

 

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

tableend

overview

we design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world   our business model is carefully constructed around the following attributes 









the combined effect of these attributes is that we have consistently grown free cash flow and gained market share in analog and embedded processing these attributes put us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operations  















 



results of operations

we continued to perform well in 2015 reflecting our focus on analog and embedded processing semiconductors these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and we believe have dependable longterm growth opportunities in 2015 analog and embedded processing represented 86 percent of revenue up from 83 percent in 2014 gross margin of 582 percent for the year a new record reflects the quality of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy

our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations in 2015 free cash flow also a record was 286 percent of revenue up from 269 percent a year ago and consistent with our targeted range of 2030 percent of revenue during the year we returned 42 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure for a reconciliation to gaap and an explanation of the reason for providing this nongaap measure see the nongaap financial information section after the liquidity and capital resources section

details of financial results – 2015 compared with 2014 

revenue of 1300 billion was about even with 2014 as higher revenue from analog and embedded processing was offset by lower revenue from other our 2015 revenue was negatively affected by about 150 million from changes in foreign currency exchange rates

gross profit was 756 billion an increase of 133 million or 2 percent due to lower manufacturing costs gross profit margin was 582 percent of revenue compared with 569 percent

operating expenses were 128 billion for rd and 175 billion for sga rd expense decreased 78 million or 6 percent and sga decreased 95 million or 5 percent  both comparisons reflect savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align costs with growth opportunities including the completed restructuring actions in embedded processing and japan these decreases were partially offset by higher compensationrelated costs

acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of national semiconductor and were 329 million about even with 2014 these noncash charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets see note 13 to the financial statements

restructuring chargesother was a net credit of 71 million which included gains on sales of assets of 83 million that were partially offset by 12 million related to restructuring charges and other credits this compared with a net credit of 51 million in 2014  reflecting gains on sales of assets of 75 million that were partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of 24 million these amounts are included in other for segment reporting purposes see note 3 to the financial statements

operating profit was 427 billion or 329 percent of revenue compared with 395 billion or 303 percent of revenue

the income tax provision was 123 billion compared with 105 billion the increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and to a lesser extent a lower benefit from nonus effective tax rates our annual effective tax rate was 29 percent in 2015 and 27 percent in 2014 see note 6 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the income tax provision to the statutory federal tax

net income was 299 billion an increase of 165 million or 6 percent eps was 282 compared with 257 eps benefited 007 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program

in the near term for the first quarter of 2016 we expect about a 150 million decline in revenue from the first quarter of 2015 within a sector of the personal electronics market

 

segment results – 201 5 compared with 2014 

analog includes high volume analog  logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog sva product lines

 



 

analog revenue increased primarily due to hval power and sva also grew but to a lesser extent hpa declined due to the mix of products shipped operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit and to a lesser extent lower manufacturing costs

embedded processing includes microcontrollers processors and connectivity product lines

 



 

embedded processing revenue increased due about equally to connectivity and microcontrollers which together offset a decline in processors operating profit increased primarily due to lower operating expenses

other includes dlp products calculators custom asics and royalties

 



 

includes acquisition charges and restructuring chargesother

 

other revenue declined primarily due to custom asics revenue from dlp products also declined but to a lesser extent operating profit declined primarily due to lower revenue and associated gross profit

prior results of operations

in 2014 analog revenue grew 13 percent and embedded processing revenue grew 12 percent gross margin of 569 percent for 2014 reflected the diversity and longevity of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy in 2014 free cash flow was 269 percent of revenue up from 244 percent in 2013 during 2014 we returned 42 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends

details of financial results – 2014 compared with 2013 

revenue was 1305 billion up 840 million or 7 percent from 2013 due to higher revenue from analog and embedded processing these increases more than offset lower revenue from legacy wireless products

gross profit was 743 billion an increase of 106 billion or 17 percent from 2013 primarily due to higher revenue and to a lesser extent the mix of products shipped gross profit margin was 569 percent of revenue compared with 521 percent in 2013

operating expenses were 136 billion for rd and 184 billion for sga rd expense decreased 164 million or 11 percent from 2013 primarily due to savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align costs with growth opportunities including the winddown of our legacy wireless products and restructuring actions in embedded processing and japan sga expense was about even as higher variable compensation costs were offset by savings from our cost alignment efforts

acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of national semiconductor and were 330 million compared with 341 million in 2013 the charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets

 

restructuring chargesother was a net credit of 51 million which included gains on sales of assets of 75 million that were partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of 24 million this compared with a net credit of 189 million in 2013 reflecting a 315 million gain from our transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer that was partially offset by restructuring charges of 126 million 

operating profit was 395 billion or 303 percent of revenue compared with 283 billion or 232 percent in 2013

the income tax provision was 105 billion compared with 592 million in 2013 the increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and to a lesser extent the effect of the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research tax credit for 2012 in 2013 our annual effective tax rate was 27 percent in 2014 and 24 percent in 2013 

net income was 282 billion an increase of 659 million or 30 percent from 2013 eps was 257 compared with 191 in 2013 eps benefited 007 from 2013 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program

financial condition

at the end of 2015 total cash cash and cash equivalents plus shortterm investments was 322 billion a decrease of 323 million from the end of 2014

accounts receivable were 117 billion at the end of 2015 this was a decrease of 81 million compared with the end of 2014 days sales outstanding were 33 at the end of 2015 compared with 34 at the end of 2014

 

inventory was 169 billion at the end of 2015 this was a decrease of 93 million from the end of 2014 days of inventory at the end of 2015 were 115 compared with 11 7 at the end of 2014 

liquidity and capital resources

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and a variable rate revolving credit facility cash flows from operating activities for 2015 was 427 billion an increase of 376 million from 2014 primarily due to an increase in cash provided by working capital

our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investmentgrade banks and allows us to borrow up to 2 billion until march 2020 this credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper as of december 31 2015 our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding

in 2015 investing activities used 302 million compared with 377 million in 2014 for 2015 capital expenditures were 551 million compared with 385 million in 2014 capital expenditures in both periods were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in 2015 we had sales of shortterm investments net of purchases that provided cash of 125 million in comparison in 2014 we had purchases of shortterm investments net of sales that used cash of 141 million in addition we had proceeds from sales of assets of 110 million in 2015 compared with 142 million in 2014 

in 2015 financing activities used 417 billion compared with 394 billion in 2014 in both 2015 and 2014  we received proceeds of 498 million from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt net of original issuance discount and repaid 100 billion of maturing debt dividends paid in 2015 were 144 billion compared with 132 billion in 2014 reflecting increases in the dividend rate during 2015 the quarterly dividend increased from 034 to 038 per share resulting in an annualized dividend payment of 152 per share during 2014 we increased our quarterly dividend from 030 to 034 per share in 2015 we used 274 billion to repurchase 514 million shares of our common stock this compared with 283 billion used in 2014 to repurchase 617 million shares employee exercises of stock options are also reflected in cash flows from financing activities in 2015 these exercises provided cash proceeds of 442 million compared with 616 million in 2014

we had 100 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 222 billion of shortterm investments as of december 31 2015 with our us entities owning about 80 percent of these amounts combined at the end of 2015 we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend and debtrelated payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months 

nongaap financial information

this mda includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure these are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flows from operating activities also referred to as cash flow from operations we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity our cashgenerating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to investors as well as insight into our financial performance these nongaap measures are supplemental to the comparable gaap measures reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaapbased measures is provided in the table below

 



 

 

longterm contractual obligations 

 



 

a includes the related interest payments and amounts classified as the current portion of longterm debt specifically obligations that will mature within 12 months 

b includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases 

c includes payments under license agreements for electronic design automation software 

d includes contractual arrangements with suppliers where there is a fixed noncancellable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule excluded from the table are cancellable arrangements however depending on when certain purchase arrangements may be cancelled an additional 4 million of cancellation penalties may be required to be paid which are not reflected in the table 

e includes an estimate of payments under this plan for the liability that existed at december 31 2015 

f excluded from the table are 84 million of uncertain tax liabilities under asc 740 as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans we plan to contribute about 100 million in 2016 but funding projections beyond 2016 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting taxdeductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance interest rates and potential us and nonus legislation 

critical accounting policies

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we use statistical analyses estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results we consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a significant effect on our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from sales of our products including direct sales to our distributors when title and risk of loss pass which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the terms of the sales order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sales amounts are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured for sales to distributors payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products

we recognize revenue net of allowances which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances are based on analysis of historical data current economic conditions and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized allowances may include volumebased incentives product returns due to quality issues incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements for instance we sell to distributors at standard published prices but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities to estimate allowances we use statistical percentages of revenue which are determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration we continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity

we may also provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slowselling or obsolete products in their inventory estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributor’s purchases from us in addition if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributor’s onhand inventory we may credit them for the 

 

difference between those prices the allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributor’s onhand inventory of that produc t 

we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner

revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements including consignment arrangements with distributors is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above but delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations

we determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue related to licenses of our patent portfolio based on our contractual agreements with licensees we recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable

in addition we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging when collection is at risk we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and if necessary will record a charge in the period such determination is made we include amounts received from customers for reimbursement of shipping fees in revenue we include the costs of shipping and handling in cor

income taxes 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense

in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals

as part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future years our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made also our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our nonus operations could change such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years

in addition to the factors described above the effective tax rate reflected in forwardlooking statements is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment as a discrete tax item

inventory valuation allowances 

inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials workinprocess and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and workinprocess based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance examples are an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

foreign exchange risk 

the us dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently on our effective tax rate 

our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts based on yearend 2015 balances and currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss   of less than 1 million

we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures for example at yearend 2015 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 464 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 175 million to sell japanese yen and 139 million to sell euros similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2014 

interest rate risk 

we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates 1 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and 2 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt 

as of december 31 2015 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by 6 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 111 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debt

equity risk 

longterm investments at yearend 2015 include the following 







investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments fair values would not materially affect operating results nonmarketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost impairments deemed to be otherthantemporary are expensed in net income investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method see note 8 to the financial statements for details of equity and other longterm investments

disclosure controls and procedures 

an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of ti’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of ti’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 based upon that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

internal control over financial reporting 

report by management on internal control over financial reporting

the management of ti is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting ti’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements issued for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

ti management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 in making this assessment we used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria in internal control − integrated framework based on our assessment we believe that as of december 31 2015 our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the coso criteria 

ti’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting which immediately follows this report

texas instruments incorporated

we have audited texas instruments incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 based on criteria established in internal control − integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework the coso criteria texas instruments incorporated’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report by management on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

in our opinion texas instruments incorporated maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 based on the coso criteria

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of texas instruments incorporated and subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 and 2014 and the related consolidated statements of income comprehensive income stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015 and our report dated february 24 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item 1 business 

we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in 35 countries we have two reportable segments analog and embedded processing we report the results of our remaining business activities in other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segments in 2014 we generated 1305 billion of revenue 

product information 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors generally known as “chips” combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit we have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment 

we sell catalog and applicationspecific standard semiconductor products both of which we market to multiple customers catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release applicationspecific standard products assps are designed for use by a smaller number of customers and are targeted to a specific application the life cycles of assps are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months although some can be used across multiple generations of customers’ products the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products that are differentiated from competitors’ products 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segment follows 

analog 

analog generated 81 billion of revenue in 2014 analog semiconductors change realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure or images by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in every electronic device whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery our analog products are used in many markets particularly personal electronics and industrial 

sales of our analog products generated 62 percent of our revenue in 2014 according to external sources the market for analog semiconductors was 44 billion in 2014 our analog segment’s revenue in 2014 was 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

our analog segment includes the following product lines high volume analog  logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog sva 

hval products 

these include highvolume integrated analog products for specific applications and highvolume catalog products hval products support applications like automotive safety devices touchscreen controllers lowvoltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllers 

power products 

these include both catalog products and assps that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio of power products is designed to enhance the efficiency of powered devices using battery management solutions portable power conversion devices power supply controls and pointofload products 

hpa products 

these include catalog analog products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products hpa products include highspeed data converters amplifiers sensors high reliability products interface products and precision analog products that are typically used in systems that require high performance hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years 

sva products 

these include a broad portfolio of industrial highvoltage power management data converter interface and operational amplifier catalog products used in manufacturing a wide range of electronic systems sva products support applications like video and data interface products electrical arcfault detection systems and mobile lighting and display systems sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years sva consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation national in 2011 

embedded processing 

embedded processing generated 27 billion of revenue in 2014 embedded processing products are the “brains” of many electronic devices embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application the devices vary from simple lowcost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in communications infrastructure equipment our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotive 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next 

sales of embedded processing products generated 21 percent of our revenue in 2014 according to external sources the market for embedded processors was 18 billion in 2014 we held the number two position which represented 15 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

our embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines processor microcontrollers and connectivity 

processor products 

these include digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors are typically tailored for a specific class of applications such as communications infrastructure and automotive infotainment and advanced driver assistance systems they are also sold into broad industrial applications 

microcontroller products 

these include selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length with no operating system and low software complexity analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers 

connectivity products 

these include products that enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data and the requirements for speed data capability distance power and security vary depending on the application our connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements including lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee® and other technologies like bluetooth® wifi and gps our connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products enabling data to be collected transmitted and acted upon 

other 

other generated 22 billion of revenue in 2014 and includes 

 

we also include in other items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments these include acquisitionrelated charges restructuring charges and certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance settlements and gains and losses from other activities including asset dispositions 

financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in note 1 to the financial statements which is included in item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” risks attendant to our foreign operations are described in item 1a “risk factors” 

markets for our products 

the table below lists the major markets that used our products in 2014 and the estimated percentage of our 2014 revenue that the market represented the chart also lists in decreasing order of our revenue the sectors within each market 



market characteristics 

product cycle 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

we employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we acquire our facilities and equipment ahead of demand which usually allows us to acquire this capacity at lower costs we focus our resources on our analog and embedded processing segments which serve diverse markets and diverse customers this diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers additionally we utilize consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors which gives us realtime insight into endmarket demand allowing us to better manage our factory loadings 

seasonality 

our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor revenue tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters 

competitive landscape 

the analog and embedded processing markets are highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate 

we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a product’s performance integration and power characteristics 

manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeks 

the cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as some of our processor products 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation we own much of our manufacturing capacity therefore a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loadings decrease our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstances 

our profit margins decrease conversely as factory loadings increase our fixed costs are spread over increased output and absent other circumstances our profit margins increase however our operating focus is more on maximizing longterm free cash flow than minimizing shortterm variations in profit margins caused by factory loadings free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures 

to this end we seek to maximize longterm free cash flow by keeping capital expenditures low through opportunistic purchases of facilities and equipment ahead of demand for example in 2013 we purchased an assemblytest facility in chengdu china in 2014 we initiated plans to adapt existing facilities to manufacture more products including new products using 300millimeter wafers our most costeffective manufacturing process these activities may have nearterm effects on our profit margins but we believe they will result in longterm benefits to free cash flow 

we expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2014 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 percent of our assemblytest services from subcontractors 

inventory 

our inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand we carry proportionally more inventory of products with long life cycles and a broad customer base additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand we also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and distributors 

design centers 

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

customers 

we estimate that we sell our products to more than 100000 customers our customer base is diverse with onethird of our revenue deriving from customers outside our top 100 in addition no single customer accounts for 10 percent or more of our revenue most of our customers purchase our products through distributors 

sales and distribution 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force and distributors we have sales or marketing offices in 34 countries about 60 percent of our revenue comes through distribution channels our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of ticonsigned and distributorowned inventory over time we expect this mix will continue to shift more toward consignment about 60 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us in september 2011 we acquired national semiconductor corporation 

backlog 

we define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations further our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery ie when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory our backlog of orders was 094 billion at december 31 2014 and 106 billion at december 31 2013 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include dlp ®  

research and development 

our rd expense was 136 billion in 2014 compared with 152 billion in 2013 and 188 billion in 2012 our primary areas of rd investment are analog and embedded processing products our rd has been declining primarily as a result of our decision to wind down investments in legacy wireless products this winddown is now complete 

we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities our results of operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key endequipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

our margins may vary over time 

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

the markets we serve are characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured so we may not be able to successfully develop and market these new products we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years after they are completed further the products we do 

develop and market might not be wellreceived by customers and we might not realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate for example the china market is highly competitive and both international and domestic competitors are aggressively seeking to increase their market share additionally we may face increased competition as a result of china’s adoption of policies designed to promote its domestic semiconductor industry certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology 

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

a decline in demand in certain markets or sectors could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of markets and sectors within those markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the personal electronics and communications equipment markets decline in one or more sectors within these markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations subject us to risks associated with international political economic or other conditions 

we have facilities in 35 countries about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue operating internationally exposes us to political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as health epidemics severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance 

in 2014 about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us 

our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory 

we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed 

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing services 

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment and those of some of our customers and suppliers require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree 

our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

we have facilities in 35 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

we have not made a provision for us income tax on the portion of our undistributed earnings of our nonus subsidiaries that is considered permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we repatriate any of these foreign earnings we might incur incremental us income tax which could affect our results of operations 

our operations could be affected by the complex laws rules and regulations to which our business is subject 

we are subject to complex laws rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to for example environmental safety and health exports and imports bribery and corruption tax data privacy labor and employment competition and intellectual property ownership and infringement compliance with these laws rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business could be restricted and we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws rules and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business 

some of these complex laws rules and regulations – for example those related to environmental safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products especially if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available or be available at reasonable cost 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its 

eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims product recalls product liability claims or legal proceedings 

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims product recalls or legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our reputation 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including the other risk factors described under item 1a many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity or the disposition of assets 

our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

from time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations 

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systems or those of our customers or suppliers 

breaches of our information technology systems or those of our customers or suppliers could be caused by computer viruses unauthorized access sabotage vandalism or terrorism these breaches could compromise our information technology networks or those of our customers or suppliers and could result in unauthorized release of our our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in release of employee personal data or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

we design make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world our business model is carefully constructed around several advantages that are unique to ti 

 these advantages have resulted in consistent share gains and free cash flow growth and they put us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholders 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our results of operations 

 17 

 

results of operations 

we continued to perform well in 2014 reflecting our focus on analog and embedded processing semiconductors we believe these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have dependable longterm growth opportunities in 2014 analog revenue grew 13 percent and embedded processing revenue grew 12 percent these two segments represented 83 percent of ti revenue for the year up from 79 percent in 2013 gross margin of 569 percent for the year reflects the diversity and longevity of our product portfolio as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy our business model focused on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations in 2014 free cash flow was 27 percent of revenue up 3 percentage points from a year ago during the year we returned 42 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure for a reconciliation to gaap and an explanation of the reason for providing this nongaap measure see the nongaap financial information section after the liquidity and capital resources section 

details of financial results – 2014 compared with 2013 

revenue was 1305 billion up 840 million or 7 percent from 2013 due to higher revenue from analog and embedded processing these increases more than offset lower revenue from legacy wireless products 

gross profit was 743 billion an increase of 106 billion or 17 percent from 2013 primarily due to higher revenue and to a lesser extent a more favorable mix of products shipped gross profit margin was 569 percent of revenue compared with 521 percent in 2013 

operating expenses were 136 billion for rd and 184 billion for sga rd expense decreased 164 million or 11 percent from 2013 primarily due to savings from ongoing efforts across the company to align costs with growth opportunities including the previously announced winddown of our legacy wireless products and restructuring actions in embedded processing and japan rd expense as a percent of revenue was 104 percent compared with 125 percent in 2013 sga expense was about even as higher variable compensation costs were offset by savings from our cost alignment efforts sga expense as a percent of revenue was 141 percent compared with 152 percent in 2013 

acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of national semiconductor and were 330 million compared with 341 million in 2013 the charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets see note 3 to the financial statements for detailed information 

restructuring chargesother was a net credit of 51 million which included gains on sales of assets of 75 million partially offset by restructuring charges and other expenses of 24 million this compared with a net credit of 189 million in 2013 reflecting a 315 million gain from our transfer of wireless connectivity technology to a customer partially offset by restructuring charges of 126 million these amounts are included in other for segment reporting purposes for details on the types of costs incurred and the amounts associated with each restructuring action see note 4 to the financial statements 

operating profit was 395 billion or 303 percent of revenue compared with 283 billion or 232 percent in 2013 

the income tax provision was 105 billion compared with 592 million in 2013 the increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and to a lesser extent the effect of the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research tax credit for 2012 in 2013 our annual effective tax rates were 27 percent in 2014 and 24 percent in 2013 the federal research tax credit included in the annual effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 expired at the end of 2014 see note 7 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the income tax provision to the statutory federal tax 

our annual effective tax rate benefits from lower rates compared to the us statutory rate applicable to our operations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate and from us tax benefits these lower nonus tax rates are generally statutory in nature without expiration and available to companies that operate in those taxing jurisdictions we benefit to a lesser extent from tax holidays in nonus jurisdictions in particular malaysia and the philippines pretax income related to assemblytest manufacturing facilities in those jurisdictions is included in the nonus effective tax rates reconciling item 

net income was 282 billion an increase of 659 million or 30 percent from 2013 eps was 257 compared with 191 in 2013 eps benefited 007 from 2013 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program 

segment results – 2014 compared with 2013 

analog includes high volume analog  logic power management high performance analog and silicon valley analog product lines 



analog revenue increased in all products lines revenue from power grew the most followed by revenue from in decreasing order hpa hval and sva operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit 

embedded processing includes processor microcontrollers and connectivity product lines 



embedded processing revenue increased primarily due to microcontrollers and processor which contributed about equally to the increase connectivity increased to a lesser extent revenue from processor increased as a result of a more favorable mix of products shipped operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit 

other includes dlp products custom asic products calculators royalties and legacy wireless products 



other revenue decreased due to legacy wireless products operating profit was about even as reductions in operating expenses were offset by changes in restructuring chargesother see note 4 to the financial statements for information regarding restructuring chargesother 

prior results of operations 

our performance in 2013 was strong reflecting our increased focus on analog and embedded processing during 2013 79 percent of our revenue came from analog and embedded processing with analog revenue increasing 3 percent from 2012 and embedded processing revenue increasing 9 percent from 2012 operating margin for analog was 258 percent and it exceeded 

30 percent during the second half of 2013 operating margin for embedded processing was 76 percent additionally we completed our exit from legacy wireless products our business model continued to generate strong cash flow from operations with free cash flow for 2013 of 3 billion or 24 percent of revenue during 2013 we returned over 4 billion of cash to investors through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends 

details of financial results –  2013 compared with 2012 

revenue was 1220 billion down 620 million or 5 percent from 2012 due to lower revenue from legacy wireless products 

despite the decline in overall revenue gross profit of 636 billion was about even with 2012 due to a more favorable mix of products shipped and to a lesser extent lower manufacturing costs gross profit margin was 521 percent of revenue compared with 496 percent in 2012 

operating expenses were 152 billion for rd and 186 billion for sga rd expense decreased 355 million or 19 percent from 2012 primarily reflecting the winddown of our legacy wireless products rd expense as a percent of revenue was 125 percent compared with 146 percent in 2012 sga expense increased 54 million or 3 percent from 2012 primarily due to higher variable compensation and other support costs partially offset by reduced costs from the winddown of our legacy wireless products sga expense as a percent of revenue was 152 percent compared with 141 percent in 2012 

acquisition charges were related to our 2011 acquisition of national and were 341 million in 2013 compared with 450 million in 2012 the charges were primarily from the amortization of intangible assets the decrease from 2012 was due to the nonrecurrence of integrationrelated expenses 

restructuring chargesother was a net credit of 189 million reflecting the 315 million gain from the technology transfer partially offset by restructuring charges of 126 million this compared with a net charge of 264 million in 2012 which included restructuring and other charges of 408 million partially offset by a 144 million gain from the transfer of the obligations and assets of a portion of our japan pension program from the pension trust to the government of japan these net amounts are all included in other for details on restructuring actions see note 4 to the financial statements 

operating profit was 283 billion or 232 percent of revenue compared with 197 billion or 154 percent of revenue in 2012 

the income tax provision was 592 million compared with 176 million for 2012 the increase in the total tax provision was due to higher income before income taxes and to a lesser extent lower discrete tax benefits the discrete tax benefits were 79 million in 2013 primarily due to the effect of the reinstatement of the federal research tax credit for 2012 in 2012 the discrete tax benefits were 252 million primarily due to additional us tax benefits for manufacturing related to prior years our annual effective tax rates were 24 percent in 2013 and 22 percent in 2012 

net income was 216 billion an increase of 403 million or 23 percent from 2012 eps was 191 compared with 151 for 2012 eps benefited 006 from 2012 due to a lower number of average shares outstanding as a result of our stock repurchase program 

segment results– 2013 compared with 2012 

analog 



analog revenue increased primarily due to growth in power revenue from sva and hpa also increased but to a lesser extent hval revenue decreased primarily due to a less favorable mix of products shipped operating profit increased primarily due to higher gross profit that benefited from higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs this increase in gross profit was partially offset by higher operating expenses 

embedded processing 



embedded processing revenue increased primarily due to higher revenue from microcontrollers and to a lesser extent processor and connectivity operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit partially offset by higher operating expenses 

other 



revenue from other decreased primarily due to lower revenue from legacy wireless products operating profit from other increased due to lower operating expenses and restructuring chargesother these decreases were partially offset by lower revenue and associated gross profit 

financial condition 

at the end of 2014 total cash cash and cash equivalents plus shortterm investments was 354 billion a decrease of 288 million from the end of 2013 

accounts receivable were 125 billion at the end of 2014 this was an increase of 43 million compared with the end of 2013 due to higher revenue days sales outstanding were 34 at the end of 2014 compared with 36 at the end of 2013 

inventory was 178 billion at the end of 2014 this was an increase of 53 million from the end of 2013 days of inventory at the end of 2014 were 117 compared with 112 at the end of 2013 as sales to distributors become a larger portion of our revenue we expect consignment inventory to become a larger portion of our total inventory this may lead to changes in the level of inventory we carry in the future 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and revolving credit facilities cash flow from operating activities for 2014 was 389 billion an increase of 508 million from 2013 due to an increase in net income 

we had 120 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 234 billion of shortterm investments as of december 31 2014 our us entities owned 82 percent of total cash at the end of 2014 

we have a variablerate revolving credit facility with a consortium of investmentgrade banks that allows us to borrow up to 2 billion until march 2019 this credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper as of december 31 2014 our credit facility was undrawn and we had no commercial paper outstanding 

in 2014 investing activities used 377 million compared with 3 million in 2013 for 2014 capital expenditures were 385 million compared with 412 million in 2013 capital expenditures in both periods were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in 2014 we had purchases of shortterm investments net of sales that used cash of 141 million in comparison in 2013 we had sales of shortterm investments net of purchases that provided cash proceeds of 342 million in addition we had proceeds from sales of assets of 142 million in 2014 compared with 21 million in 2013 

in 2014 financing activities used net cash of 394 billion compared with 317 billion in 2013 in 2014 we received proceeds of 498 million from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt net of original issuance discount and repaid 100 billion of maturing debt in 2013 we received proceeds of 986 million from the issuance of fixedrate longterm debt net of original issuance discount and repaid 150 billion of maturing debt dividends paid in 2014 were 132 billion compared with 118 billion in 2013 reflecting increases in the dividend rate during 2014 the quarterly dividend increased from 030 to 034 per share resulting in an annualized dividend payment of 136 per share in 2013 we announced two increases in our quarterly dividend increasing from 021 to 030 per share in 2014 we used 283 billion to repurchase 617 million shares of our common stock this compared with 287 billion used in 2013 to repurchase 776 million shares employee exercises of stock options are also reflected in cash flows from financing activities in 2014 these exercises provided cash proceeds of 616 million compared with 131 billion in 2013 stock option exercises in 2013 were higher than historical averages 

we believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures dividend and debtrelated payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months 

nongaap financial information 

this mda includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure these are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flows from operating activities also referred to as cash flow from operations we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity our cashgenerating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to investors as well as insight into our financial performance these nongaap measures are supplemental to the comparable gaap measures reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaapbased measures is provided in the table below 



longterm contractual obligations 



critical accounting policies 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we use statistical analyses estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and may vary from actual results we consider the following accounting policies to be both those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require the most subjective judgment if actual results differ significantly from management’s estimates and projections there could be a significant effect on our financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue from sales of our products including direct sales to our distributors when title and risk of loss pass which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the terms of the sales order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sales amounts are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured for sales to distributors payment is due on our standard commercial terms and is not contingent upon resale of the products in 2014 about 60 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributors 

we recognize revenue net of allowances which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to customers or distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry these allowances are based on analysis of historical data current economic conditions and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized allowances may include volumebased incentives product returns due to quality issues incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities and special pricing arrangements for instance we sell to distributors at standard published prices but we may grant them price adjustment credits in response to individual competitive opportunities to estimate allowances we use statistical percentages of revenue which are determined quarterly based upon recent historical adjustment trends historical claims data are maintained for each of the programs with differences among geographic regions taken into consideration we continually monitor the actual claimed allowances against our estimates and we adjust our estimates as appropriate to reflect trends in distributor revenue and inventory levels allowances are also adjusted when recent historical data do not represent anticipated future activity 

we may also provide distributors an allowance to scrap certain slowselling or obsolete products in their inventory estimated as a negotiated fixed percentage of each distributor’s purchases from us in addition if we publish a new price for a product that is lower than that paid by distributors for the same product still remaining in each distributor’s onhand inventory we may credit 

them for the difference between those prices the allowance for this type of credit is based on the identified product price difference applied to our estimate of each distributor’s onhand inventory of that product 

we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner 

revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements including consignment arrangements with distributors is recognized in accordance with the principles discussed above but delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations about 60 percent of our distributor revenue is generated from sales of consigned inventory the allowances we record against this revenue are not material 

we determine the amount and timing of royalty revenue based on our contractual agreements with intellectual property licensees we recognize royalty revenue when earned under the terms of the agreements and when we consider realization of payment to be probable 

in addition we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging when collection is at risk we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and if necessary will record a charge in the period such determination is made we include amounts received from customers for reimbursement of shipping fees in revenue we include the costs of shipping and handling in cor 

income taxes 

in determining net income for financial statement purposes we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 

in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due although we believe the estimates are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 

as part of our financial process we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future years our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors including changes in us or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods these changes if any may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made also our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain of our nonus operations could change such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years 

in addition to the factors described above the effective tax rate reflected in forwardlooking statements is based on thencurrent tax law significant changes in tax law enacted during the year could affect these estimates retroactive changes in tax law enacted subsequent to the end of a reporting period are reflected in the period of enactment as a discrete tax item 

inventory valuation allowances 

inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials workinprocess and finished goods statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and workinprocess based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons for finished goods quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold a specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance examples are an endoflife part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of market prices for those products actual future writeoffs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand customer negotiations technology shifts and other factors 

impairment of acquisitionrelated intangibles and goodwill 

we review acquisitionrelated intangible assets for impairment when certain indicators suggest an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable factors considered include the asset’s underperformance compared with expectations and shortened useful life due to planned changes in its use recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over fair value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique additionally in the case of an intangible asset that will continue to be used in future periods a shortened useful life may be utilized if appropriate resulting in accelerated amortization based upon the expected net realizable value of the asset at the date the asset will no longer be utilized 

we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise such as significant changes in business climate operating performance or competition or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred between annual test dates this impairment review compares the fair value for each reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows discount rates based on weighted average cost of capital and future economic and market conditions we base our fairvalue estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable 

actual cash flow amounts for future periods may differ from estimates used in impairment testing 

changes in accounting standards

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign exchange risk 

the us dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting our nonus entities own assets or liabilities denominated in us dollars or other currencies exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently on our effective tax rate 

our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from nonus dollar currencies because most of the aggregate nonus dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts based on yearend 2014 balances and currency exchange rates a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in nonus currency exchange rates would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than 1 million 

we use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures for example at yearend 2014 we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of 504 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures including 183 million to sell japanese yen 163 million to sell euros and 29 million to sell british pound sterling similar hedging activities existed at yearend 2013 

interest rate risk 

we have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates 1 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments which could produce a gain or a loss and 2 the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt 

as of december 31 2014 a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and shortterm investments by 12 million and decrease the fair value of our longterm debt by 128 million because interest rates on our longterm debt are fixed changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with longterm debt 

equity risk 

longterm investments at yearend 2014 include the following 

 investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments fair values would not materially affect operating results nonmarketable equity securities and some venture capital funds are stated at cost impairments deemed to be otherthantemporary are expensed in net income investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method see note 9 to the financial statements for details of equity and other longterm investments

 item 1 business 

company overview 

at texas instruments ti we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in 35 countries we have three segments analog embedded processing and other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segments 

financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in note 16 to the financial statements captioned “segment and geographic area data” in ti’s 2013 annual report to stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference to such report risks attendant to our foreign operations are described in item 1a “risk factors” 

product information 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our products more than 100000 orderable parts are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment 

we sell catalog and applicationspecific standard semiconductor products both of which we market to multiple customers catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels the vast majority of our catalog products are differentiated we also sell catalog commodity products but they account for a small percentage of our revenue the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release applicationspecific standard products assps are designed for use by a smaller number of customers and are targeted to a specific application the life cycles of assps are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months although some can be used across multiple generations of customers’ products 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segment’s products follows 

analog 

analog semiconductors change realworld signals  such as sound temperature pressure or images  by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as embedded processors analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery we estimate that we sell our analog products to more than 100000 customers our analog products are used in many markets particularly personal electronics and industrial 

sales of our analog products generated about 60 percent of our revenue in 2013 according to external sources the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about 40 billion in 2013 our analog segment’s revenue in 2013 was 72 billion or about 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

our analog segment includes the following major product lines high volume analog  logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog sva 

hval products these include highvolume integrated analog products for specific applications and highvolume catalog products hval products support applications like automotive safety devices touch screen controllers low voltage motor drivers and integrated motor controllers 

power products these include both catalog products and assps that help customers manage power in electronic systems our broad portfolio of power products is designed to enhance the efficiency of powered devices using battery management solutions portable power conversion devices power supply controls and pointofload products 

hpa products these include catalog analog products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products hpa products include highspeed data converters amplifiers sensors high reliability products interface products and precision analog products that are typically used in systems that require high performance hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years 

sva products these include a broad portfolio of power management data converter interface and operational amplifier catalog analog products used in manufacturing a wide range of products sva products support applications like video and data interface products electrical faultarc detection systems and mobile lighting and display systems sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years sva consists primarily of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation in 2011 

embedded processing 

embedded processing products are the “brains” of many electronic devices embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance power and cost depending on the application the devices vary from simple lowcost products used in electric toothbrushes to highly specialized complex devices used in wireless basestation communications infrastructure equipment our embedded processing products are used in many markets particularly industrial and automotive 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next 

sales of embedded processing products generated about 20 percent of our revenue in 2013 according to external sources the worldwide market for embedded processors was about 17 billion in 2013 our embedded processing segment’s revenue in 2013 was 24 billion this was the number two position and represented about 14 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

our embedded processing segment includes the following major product lines processors microcontrollers and connectivity 

processor products these include digital signal processors dsps and applications processors dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data applications processors run an industrystandard operating system and perform multiple complex tasks often communicating with other systems 

microcontroller products microcontrollers are selfcontained systems with a processor core memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory and program length with no operating system and low software complexity analog components that control or interface with sensors and other systems are often integrated into microcontrollers 

connectivity products connectivity products enable electronic devices to seamlessly connect and transfer data and the requirements for speed data capability distance and power vary depending on the application our connectivity products support many wireless technologies to meet these requirements including lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee ®  and other technologies like bluetooth ®  wifi and gps our connectivity products are usually designed into customer devices alongside our processor and microcontroller products enabling data to be collected transmitted and acted upon 

other 

other includes revenue from our smaller product lines such as dlp ® primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images certain custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and calculators it includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures we also include revenue from our baseband products and from our omap tm  applications processors and connectivity products sold into smartphones and consumer tablets all of which are product lines that we previously announced we are exiting and are collectively referred to as “legacy wireless products” revenue from legacy wireless products declined throughout the year and our exit from these products is complete other generated 26 billion of revenue in 2013 

we also include in other restructuring charges and certain acquisitionrelated charges as these charges are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments acquisitionrelated charges include certain fairvalue adjustments restructuring charges transaction expenses acquisitionrelated retention bonuses and amortization of intangible assets other also includes certain corporatelevel items such as litigation expenses environmental costs insurance proceeds and assets and liabilities associated with our centralized operations such as our worldwide manufacturing facilities and procurement operations 

markets for our products 

the table below lists the major markets that used our products in 2013 and the approximate percentage of our 2013 product revenue that the market represented the chart also lists the sectors within those markets into which our products were most frequently sold 



market characteristics 

product cycle 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

seasonality 

our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor revenue tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared to the second and third quarters calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters 

competitive landscape 

the analog and embedded processing markets are highly fragmented as a result we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies in each of those markets including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate 

we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a product’s performance integration and power characteristics 

manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested the wafer is cut into individual units and each unit is assembled into a package that then is usually retested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeks 

the cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as some of our processor products 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity potentially lowering our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins 

we expect to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital we utilize the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2013 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 35 percent of our assemblytest services from subcontractors 

in 2013 we closed older wafer fabrication facilities in hiji japan and houston texas in december 2013 we acquired an assemblytest facility in the hitech zone of chengdu china adjacent to our existing fabrication facility in chengdu 

inventory 

our inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence we generally carry more inventory of those products than applicationspecific products additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume catalog products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand we also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributors 

design centers 

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

customers 

our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms and companies within the electronics manufacturing services industry emsi an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies which then sell those products under their own brand emsi companies manufacture distribute and provide repair services for electronic products for oems in addition we sell to customers through distributors in 2013 no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenue 

sales and distribution 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force and distributors we have sales or marketing offices in 34 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe over the last few years distributors located around the world account for about 55 percent of our revenue our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of distributorowned and ticonsigned inventory over time we expect this mix will continue to shift more toward consignment we sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us in september 2011 we acquired national semiconductor corporation 

backlog 

we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period our backlog of orders was 106 billion at december 31 2013 and 117 billion at december 31 2012 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include dlp ®  and omap tm  

research and development 

our rd expense was 152 billion in 2013 compared with 188 billion in 2012 and 172 billion in 2011 our primary areas of rd investment are analog and embedded processing products 

we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select external industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology 

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment 

community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key endequipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

our margins may vary over time 

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be wellreceived by customers nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology 

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally 

consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

a decline in demand in certain markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the personal electronics market particularly the mobile phone sector and from sales to industrial customers decline in one of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations subject us to complex laws regulations and policies and risks associated with international political economic or other conditions 

we have facilities in 35 countries worldwide about 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue our global operations subject us to complex us and foreign laws regulations and policies relating to for example trade and export controls antibribery antitrust and privacy violations of or changes in these laws regulations and policies could result in fines penalties and sanctions that could adversely affect our results of operations operating internationally also exposes us to political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance 

in 2013 about 55 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products to distributors our distributors carry competing product lines and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products moreover our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us 

our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory 

we have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and for some distributors if a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to ticonsigned inventory our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed 

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing services 

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment and those of some of our customers and suppliers require that certain key raw materials natural resources and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflictfree additionally our costs may increase if customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflictfree 

our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

we have facilities in 35 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

our operations could be affected by changes in environmental safety and health laws and regulations 

we are subject to environmental safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business particularly those in which we manufacture our products if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business particularly if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available or be available at reasonable cost 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and service our debt obligations requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of 

operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards or settlements in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including the other risk factors described under item 1a many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity or the disposition of assets 

our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

from time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations 

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systems 

breaches of our information technology systems caused by computer viruses unauthorized access sabotage vandalism or terrorism could compromise our information technology networks and result in unauthorized release of our our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations result in release of employee personal data or cause us to incur increased information technology protection costs any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation

leases covering our currently occupied leased facilities expire at varying dates generally within the next 5 years we believe our current properties are suitable and adequate for both their intended purpose and our current and foreseeable future needs 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various inquiries and proceedings regarding laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment these matters involve various parties including government agencies and in certain cases other potentially responsible parties although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ we believe that the amount of our liability if any will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the internal revenue code requires that companies disclose in their form 10k whether they have been required to pay penalties to the internal revenue service for certain transactions that have been identified by the irs as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose we have not been required to pay any such penalties

 item 1 business 

company overview 

at ti we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 35 countries we have four segments analog embedded processing wireless and other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segments 

we were the worlds fourth largest semiconductor company in 2012 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from an external source 

financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “segment and geographic area data” in tis 2012 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

product information 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our products more than 100000 orderable parts are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment 

we sell catalog and to a lesser extent custom semiconductor products catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are sold through both distribution and direct channels the majority of our catalog products are proprietary but some are commodity products the life cycles of catalog products generally span multiple years with some products continuing to sell for decades after their initial release custom products are designed for a specific customer for a specific application are sold only to that customer and are typically sold directly to the customer the life cycles of custom products are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months 

our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements product characteristics manufacturing processes and distribution channels and how management allocates resources and measures results additional information regarding each segments products follows 

analog 

analog semiconductors change realworld signals  such as sound temperature pressure or images  by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as digital signal processors dsps analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in every electronic device whether plugged into a wall or running off a battery we estimate that we sell our analog products to more than 100000 customers these sales generated about 55 percent of our revenue in 2012 according to external sources the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about 39 billion in 2012 our analog segments revenue in 2012 was about 70 billion or about 18 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

our analog segment includes the following major product lines high volume analog  logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog sva 

hval products these include both highvolume analog and logic products highvolume analog includes integrated analog products for specific applications including custom products end markets for highvolume analog products include communications automotive computing and many consumer electronics products logic includes some commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applications 

power products these include both catalog and applicationspecific products that help customers manage power in any type of electronic system we design and manufacture power management semiconductors for both portable devices 

batterypowered devices such as handheld consumer electronics laptop computers and cordless power tools and linepowered systems products that require an external electrical source such as computers digital tvs wireless basestations and highvoltage industrial equipment 

hpa products these include catalog analog products such as amplifiers data converters and interface semiconductors that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets including the industrial communications computing and consumer electronics markets hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years 

sva products these consist of products that we acquired through our purchase of national semiconductor corporation national in 2011 these include power management data converter interface and operational amplifier catalog analog products nearly all of which are complementary to our other analog products this portfolio of thousands of products is marketed to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets sva products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years 

embedded processing 

our embedded processing products include our dsps and microcontrollers dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data microcontrollers are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment sales of embedded processing products generated about 15 percent of our revenue in 2012 according to external sources the worldwide market for embedded processors was about 17 billion in 2012 our embedded processing segments revenue in 2012 was about 20 billion this was the number two position and represented about 12 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next we make and sell catalog embedded processing products used in many different applications and applicationspecific embedded processing products used in communications infrastructure equipment and automotive applications 

wireless 

during 2012 our wireless products consisted of omap tm  applications processors connectivity products and baseband products we concentrated our wireless investments on omap applications processors and connectivity products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets sales of wireless products generated about 14 billion or about 11 percent of our revenue for 2012 of which omap and connectivity products represented about 11 billion we had 03 billion in revenue from baseband products a product line that we have previously announced we are exiting 

in november 2012 we announced that we would restructure our wireless business to focus investments on embedded markets with greater potential for sustainable growth specifically we now focus our omap applications processors and connectivity products on embedded applications with long life cycles instead of on the smartphone and consumer tablet markets where large customers are increasingly developing their own custom chips these changes will result in lower resource and investment demands and as we have previously announced elimination of the wireless segment 

embedded omap applications processors which often use a standard operating system such as android linux qnx or windows are used in applications that are multifunction need a graphically intensive user interface and often are connected to the internet embedded connectivity products include lowpower wireless network standards like zigbee ®  and other technologies such as bluetooth ®  wifi gps and near field communications both of these product lines have many of the same characteristics as those in our embedded processing segment and will be reported in that segment beginning with our firstquarter 2013 financial report in 2012 sales of these products were about 150 million 

we expect our revenue from omap and connectivity products sold into smartphone and consumer tablet applications to decline rapidly in 2013 and to substantially cease by the end of the year we also expect baseband revenue to be essentially zero in 2013 beginning with our firstquarter 2013 financial report financial results for wireless products for the smartphone and consumer tablet markets will be included in other 

other 

other includes revenue from our smaller product lines such as dlp ® primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics and calculators it also includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures other generated about 25 billion or about 19 percent of our revenue in 2012 we also include in other certain acquisitionrelated charges that are not used in evaluating results of and allocating resources to our analog embedded processing and wireless segments these charges include certain fairvalue adjustments restructuring charges transaction expenses acquisitionrelated retention bonuses and amortization of intangible assets other also includes certain corporatelevel items such as litigation and environmental costs insurance proceeds and assets and liabilities associated with our centralized operations such as our worldwide manufacturing facilities and procurement operations 

applications for our products 

the table below lists the major end markets that used our products in 2012 and the approximate percentage of our 2012 product revenue that the market represented the chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets 



market characteristics 

product cycle 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing 

capacity these are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

seasonality 

our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor sales generally are seasonally weaker in the first and fourth quarters and stronger in the second and third quarters as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters 

competitive landscape 

in each segment we face significant global competition from numerous large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a companys product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale 

the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity our primary analog competitors include analog devices inc fairchild semiconductor corporation freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc nxp semiconductors nv qualcomm incorporated richtek technology corporation and stmicroelectronics nv 

the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a products performance and power characteristics primary competitors of our embedded processing segment include atmel corporation freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag microchip technology inc nxp semiconductors nv renesas electronics corporation and stmicroelectronics nv 

the primary competitive factors for our wireless products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise applications support and a products performance and power characteristics primary wireless competitors include broadcom corp csr plc intel corporation marvell technology group ltd nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and samsung lsi 

manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested the wafer is cut into individual units and each unit is assembled into a package that then is usually retested the entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities and requires an average of 12 weeks with most products completing within 8 to 16 weeks 

the cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by technology our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using mature and stable and therefore less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced cmos logic products such as our wireless products 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity potentially hurting our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins 

we expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs to supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries and subcontractors in 2012 we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers and about 75 percent of our advanced cmos logic needs from external foundries 

in 2011 we initiated closure of an older wafer fabrication facility in hiji japan and another in houston texas we expect to complete these plant closures in 2013 

inventory 

our inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence we generally carry more inventory of those products than custom products additionally we sometimes maintain catalogproduct inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finishedgoods inventory of lowvolume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand we also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributors 

design centers 

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

customers 

our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies which then sell those products under their own brand in 2012 no single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our revenue 

sales and distribution 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales or marketing offices in 34 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe over the last few years distributors located around the world account for about 50 percent of our revenue our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of distributorowned and ticonsigned inventory over time we expect this mix will shift more toward consignment we sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us in september 2011 we acquired national semiconductor corporation 

backlog 

we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period our backlog of orders was 117 billion at december 31 2012 and 139 billion at december 31 2011 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include omap tm  and dlp ®  

research and development 

our rd expense was 188 billion in 2012 compared with 172 billion in 2011 and 157 billion in 2010 our primary areas of rd investment were analog embedded processing and wireless products as announced in november 2012 we are discontinuing future investments in wireless omap processors and connectivity solutions for smartphones and consumer tablets 

we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select external industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology 

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion

 item 1a   risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment communitys expectations changes in our andor the investment communitys expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key endequipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

our margins may vary over time 

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured 

as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology 

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries and from sales to industrial customers within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

our global operations subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

we have facilities in more than 35 countries worldwide about 90 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the united states in particular shipments of products into china typically represent a large portion of our revenue operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers have similar facilities and operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarters revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing services 

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment and those of some of our customers and suppliers require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

we have facilities in more than 35 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

our operations could be affected by changes in environmental safety and health laws and regulations 

we are subject to environmental safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business particularly those in which we manufacture our products if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business particularly if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing 

processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available or be available at reasonable cost 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and service our debt obligations requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including the other risk factors described under item 1a many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity or the disposition of assets 

our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations 

from time to time we undertake business and organizational changes including acquisitions divestitures and restructuring actions to support or carry out our strategic objectives our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results for example we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations product lines and technology and our preacquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations 

our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches of our information technology systems 

we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems caused by computer viruses unauthorized access sabotage vandalism or terrorism compromise of our information technology networks could result in unauthorized release of our our customers or our suppliers confidential or proprietary information cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations or result in release of employee personal data any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation

our principal executive offices are located at 12500 ti boulevard dallas texas the following table indicates the general location of our principal manufacturing and design operations and the reportable segments that make major use of them except as otherwise indicated we own these facilities 



 

 

our facilities in the united states contained approximately 165 million square feet at december 31 2012 of which approximately 08 million square feet were leased our facilities outside the united states contained approximately 111 million square feet at december 31 2012 of which approximately 22 million square feet were leased 

at the end of 2012 we occupied substantially all of the space in our facilities 

  

leases covering our currently occupied leased facilities expire at varying dates generally within the next 5 years we believe our current properties are suitable and adequate for both their intended purpose and our current and foreseeable future needs 




 item 3   legal proceedings 

we are involved in various inquiries and proceedings regarding laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment these matters involve various parties including government agencies and in certain cases other potentially responsible parties although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ we believe that the amount of our liability if any will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the internal revenue code requires that companies disclose in their form 10k whether they have been required to pay penalties to the internal revenue service for certain transactions that have been identified by the irs as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose we have not been required to pay any such penalties

 item 1 business 

company overview 

at ti we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 35 countries we have four segments analog embedded processing wireless and other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segments 

we were the world’s fourth largest semiconductor company in 2011 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from an external source additionally we sell calculators and related products 

on september 23 2011 we completed the acquisition of national semiconductor corporation national the acquisition has brought to ti a portfolio of thousands of analog products strong customer design tools and additional manufacturing capacity and is consistent with our strategy to grow our analog business the results of national’s operations from the acquisition date are included in our analog segment under the name silicon valley analog 

financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “segment and geographic area data” in ti’s 2011 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

product information 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our products more than 80000 in number are integrated circuits that are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution this broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment 

we sell custom and catalog semiconductor products custom products are designed for a specific customer for a specific application are sold only to that customer and are typically sold directly to the customer the life cycles of custom products are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months catalog products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are generally sold through both distribution and direct channels they include both proprietary and commodity products the life cycles of catalog products are generally longer than for custom products 

additional information regarding each segment’s products follows 

analog 

analog semiconductors change realworld signals — such as sound temperature pressure or images — by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as digital signal processors dsps analog semiconductors are also used to manage power distribution and consumption sales to our analog segment’s more than 90000 customers generated about 47 percent of our revenue in 2011 according to external sources the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about 43 billion in 2011 our analog segment’s revenue in 2011 was about 65 billion or about 15 percent of this fragmented market the leading position we believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

our analog segment includes the following major product lines high volume analog  logic hval power management power high performance analog hpa and silicon valley analog sva 

hval products these include both highvolume analog products and logic and standard linear products highvolume analog includes products for specific applications including custom products the life cycles of our highvolume analog products are generally shorter than most of our other analog product lines end markets for highvolume analog products include communications automotive computing and many consumer electronics products logic and standard linear 

includes commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applications 

power products these include both catalog and custom semiconductors that help customers manage power in any type of electronic system we design and manufacture power management semiconductors for both portable devices batterypowered devices such as handheld consumer electronics laptop computers and cordless power tools and linepowered systems products that require an external electrical source such as computers digital tvs wireless basestations and highvoltage industrial equipment 

hpa products these include catalog analog semiconductors such as amplifiers data converters and interface semiconductors that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets including the industrial communications computing and consumer electronics markets hpa products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years 

sva products these include catalog analog products particularly in the areas of power management data converters interface and operational amplifiers nearly all of which are complementary to our other analog products this portfolio of thousands of products is marketed to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets many sva products have long life cycles often more than 10 years 

embedded processing 

our embedded processing products include our dsps and microcontrollers dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data microcontrollers are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment sales of embedded processing products generated about 15 percent of our revenue in 2011 according to external sources the worldwide market for embedded processors was about 18 billion in 2011 our embedded processing segment’s revenue in 2011 was about 20 billion or about 12 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next we make and sell catalog embedded processing products used in many different applications and custom embedded processing products used in specific applications such as communications infrastructure equipment and automotive 

wireless 

growth in the wireless market is being driven by the demand for smartphones tablet computers and other emerging portable devices many of today’s smartphones and tablets use an applications processor to run the device’s software operating system and to enable the expanding functionality that has made smartphones and tablets the fastest growing wireless market segments many wireless devices also use other semiconductors to enable wireless connectivity using technologies such as bluetooth ®  wifi networks gps and near field communications nfc 

we design make and sell products to satisfy each of these requirements wireless products are typically sold in high volumes our wireless portfolio includes both catalog products and custom products sales of wireless products generated about 25 billion or about 18 percent of our revenue in 2011 with a majority of those sales to a single customer 

our wireless investments are concentrated on our omap tm  applications processors and our connectivity products areas we believe offer significant growth opportunities and which will enable us to take advantage of the increasing demand for more powerful and more functional wireless devices we no longer invest in development of baseband products products that allow a cell phone to connect to the cellular network an area we believe offers far less promising growth prospects almost all of our baseband products are sold to a single customer we expect substantially all of our baseband revenue which was 11 billion in 2011 to cease by the end of 2012 

other 

our other segment includes revenue from our smaller semiconductor product lines and from sales of our handheld graphing and scientific calculators it also includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements that we may enter into in connection with acquisitions and divestitures the semiconductor products in our other segment include dlp ®  products primarily used in 

projectors to create highdefinition images and custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics this segment generated about 25 billion or about 20 percent of our revenue in 2011 

applications for our products 

the table below lists the major end markets that used our products in 2011 and the approximate percentage of our 2011 product revenue that the market represented the chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets 



market characteristics 

product cycle 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature typically new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to highvolume production over time 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity this cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

seasonality 

our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor sales generally are seasonally weaker in the first quarter than in other quarters particularly for products sold into cell phones and other consumer electronics devices which have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters 

competitive landscape 

in each segment we face significant global competition from numerous large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale 

the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet 

wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise and capacity our primary analog competitors include analog devices inc fairchild semiconductor corporation freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc nxp semiconductors nv richtek technology corporation and stmicroelectronics nv 

the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a product’s performance and power characteristics primary competitors of our embedded processing segment include atmel corporation freescale semiconductor inc microchip technology inc nxp semiconductors nv renesas electronics corporation and stmicroelectronics nv 

the primary competitive factors for our wireless products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise applications support and a product’s performance and power characteristics primary wireless competitors include broadcom corp csr plc intel corporation marvell technology group ltd nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated renesas electronics corporation samsung lsi and 

stericsson 

manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested and the wafer is cut into pieces called chips each chip is assembled into a package that then is usually retested the entire process typically requires between 12 and 18 weeks and takes place in highly specialized facilities 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia and europe these include both 

highvolume wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity potentially hurting our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins 

the cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by product our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using older less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as our wireless products advanced logic wafer manufacturing continually requires new and expensive processes and equipment in contrast the processes and equipment required for manufacturing our analog products and most of our embedded processing products do not have this requirement 

to supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries we source about 25 percent of our wafers from external foundries with the vast majority of this outsourcing being for advanced logic wafers in 2011 external foundries provided about 75 percent of the fabricated wafers for our advanced logic manufacturing needs we expect the proportion of our advanced logic wafers provided by foundries will increase over time we expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet the vast majority of our analog production needs 

in addition to using foundries to supplement our wafer fabrication capacity we selectively use subcontractors to supplement our assemblytest capacity we generally use subcontractors for assemblytest of products that would be less costefficient to complete inhouse eg relatively lowvolume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized or when demand temporarily exceeds our internal capacity we believe we often have a cost advantage from maintaining internal assemblytest capacity 

our internalexternal manufacturing strategy reduces the level of our required capital expenditures and thereby reduces our subsequent levels of depreciation below what it would be if we sourced all manufacturing internally consequently we experience less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand and lower cash requirements for expanding and updating our manufacturing capabilities 

inventory 

our inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand because of the longer product life cycles of catalog products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence we generally carry more of those products than custom products additionally we sometimes maintain 

catalogproduct inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finished goods inventory of lowvolume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand we also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributors 

design centers 

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

customers 

our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies which then sell those products under their own brand our largest single customer in 2011 was an oem the nokia group of companies sales to nokia were about 13 percent of our revenue in 2011 about twothirds of the nokiarelated revenue was from baseband products 

sales and distribution 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales or marketing offices in 35 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe over the last few years distributors located around the world account for about 40 percent of our revenue our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of 

customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of distributorowned and 

ticonsigned inventory over time we expect this mix will shift more toward consignment we sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us 

as discussed above on september 23 2011 we completed the acquisition of national semiconductor for approximately 65 billion we funded the acquisition with a combination of available cash and the proceeds of debt issuances including 35 billion of debt securities issued in the second quarter of 2011 

backlog 

we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period our backlog of orders was 139 billion at december 31 2011 and 175 billion at december 31 2010 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include omap tm  and dlp ®  

research and development 

our primary areas of rd investment are analog embedded processing and wireless products we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select external industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology 

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion 

our rd expense was 172 billion in 2011 compared with 157 billion in 2010 and 148 billion in 2009

 item 1a   risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment 

community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key endequipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

our margins may vary over time 

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages 

andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology 

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally 

consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries and from sales to industrial customers within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

our global manufacturing design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

we have facilities in more than 35 countries worldwide and about 90 percent of our revenue comes from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing services 

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate 

manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

we have facilities in more than 35 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

our operations could be affected by changes in environmental safety and health laws and regulations 

we are subject to environmental safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business particularly those in which we manufacture our products if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business particularly if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available or be available at reasonable cost 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business make strategic acquisitions and service our debt obligations requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations 

charges associated with impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill most of our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives but they are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible asset and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such 

insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require 

our debt could affect our operations and financial condition 

from time to time we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities while we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and business and other factors affecting our operations including the other risk factors described under item 1a many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or cause us to raise funds through such means as the issuance of new debt or equity or the disposition of assets 

our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions could affect our business plans and results of operations 

in september 2011 we acquired national semiconductor corporation such a transaction can involve significant integration challenges and there can be no assurance that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to the acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate the acquired operations product lines and technology we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition which could adversely affect our business plans and operating results

 item 1 business 

 

company overview 

 

at ti we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries we have four segments analog embedded processing wireless and other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segments 

 

we were the world’s fourth largest semiconductor company in 2010 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from an external source additionally we sell calculators and related products 

 

financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “segment and geographic area data” in ti’s 2010 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

 

product information 

 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit   our semiconductors are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution our portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment 

 

we sell custom and standard semiconductor products custom products are designed for a specific customer for a specific application are sold only to that customer and are typically sold directly to the customer the life cycles of custom products are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months standard products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are generally sold through both distribution and direct channels they include both proprietary and commodity products the life cycles of standard products are generally longer than for custom products 

 

additional information regarding each segment’s products follows 

 

analog 

 

analog semiconductors change realworld signals – such as sound temperature pressure or images – by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as digital signal processors dsps analog semiconductors are also used to manage power distribution and consumption sales to our analog segment’s more than 80000 customers generated 43 percent of our revenue in 2010 according to external sources the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about 42 billion in 2010 our analog segment’s revenue in 2010 was about 6 billion or about 14 percent of this market the leading position we believe that we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

 

our analog product lines are highvolume analog  logic highperformance analog and power management 

 

highvolume analog  logic products highvolume analog includes products for specific applications including custom products the life cycles of our highvolume analog products are generally shorter than those of our highperformance analog products end markets for highvolume analog products include communications automotive computing and many consumer electronics products logic and standard linear includes commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applications 

 

highperformance analog products these include standard analog semiconductors such as amplifiers data converters and interface semiconductors our portfolio includes nearly 16000 products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets including the industrial communications computing and consumer electronics markets highperformance analog products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years 

 

  

  

power management products these include both standard and custom semiconductors that help customers manage power in any type of electronic system we design and manufacture power management semiconductors for both portable devices batterypowered devices such as handheld consumer electronics laptop computers and cordless power tools and linepowered systems products that require an external electrical source such as computers digital tvs wireless base stations and highvoltage industrial equipment 

 

embedded processing 

 

our embedded processing products include our dsps and microcontrollers dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data microcontrollers are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment sales of embedded processing products generated 15 percent of our revenue in 2010 according to external sources the worldwide market for embedded processors was about 18 billion in 2010 our embedded processing segment’s revenue in 2010 was about 2 billion or about 11 percent of this fragmented market we believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time 

 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next we make and sell standard or catalog embedded processing products used in many different applications and custom embedded processing products used in specific applications such as communications infrastructure equipment and automotive 

 

wireless 

 

growth in the wireless handset market is being driven by the demand for smartphones tablet computers and other emerging portable devices many of today’s smartphones and tablets use an applications processor to run the device’s software operating system and to enable the expanding functionality that has made smartphones the fastest growing wireless segment smartphones and tablets also use other semiconductors to enable connectivity through means other than the cellular network such as bluetooth ® devices wifi networks gps location services and near field communication nfc 

 

we design make and sell products to satisfy each of these requirements wireless products are typically sold in high volumes and our wireless portfolio includes both standard products and custom products sales of wireless products generated about 3 billion or 21 percent of our revenue in 2010 with a significant portion of those sales to a single customer 

 

our wireless investments are concentrated on our connectivity products and omap applications processors areas we believe offer significant growth opportunities and which will enable us to take advantage of the increasing demand for more powerful and more functional mobile devices we no longer invest in development of baseband products products that allow a cell phone to connect to the cellular network an area we believe offers far less promising growth prospects almost all of our baseband products are sold to a single customer we expect substantially all of our baseband revenue which was 17 billion in 2010 to cease by the end of 2012 

 

other 

 

our other segment includes revenue from our smaller semiconductor product lines and from sales of our handheld graphing and scientific calculators it also includes royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies and revenue from transitional supply agreements entered into in connection with acquisitions and divestitures the semiconductor products in our other segment include dlp® products primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images and custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics this segment generated about 3 billion or 21 percent of our revenue in 2010 

 

  

  

applications for our products 

 

the table below lists the major end markets that use our products and the approximate percentage of our product revenue that the market represents the chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets 

 

 

 

market characteristics 

 

product cycle 

 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature typically new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to highvolume production over time 

 

  

  

market cycle 

 

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity this cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

 

seasonality 

 

our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor sales generally are seasonally weaker in the first quarter than in other quarters particularly for products sold into cell phones and other consumer electronics devices which have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters royalty revenue is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

 

competitive landscape 

 

in each segment we face significant global competition from numerous large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our competitors also include emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line the strength and depth of the sales network technological innovation technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale 

 

the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance applications and sales support and manufacturing expertise our primary analog competitors include analog devices inc fairchild semiconductor corporation freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation nxp semiconductors nv richtek technology corporation and stmicroelectronics nv 

 

the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications and sales support and a product’s performance and power characteristics primary competitors of our embedded processing segment include atmel corporation freescale semiconductor inc marvell technology group ltd microchip technology inc nxp semiconductors nv renesas electronics corporation and stmicroelectronics nv 

 

the primary competitive factors for our wireless products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise applications support and a product’s performance and power characteristics primary wireless competitors include broadcom corp csr plc intel corporation marvell technology group ltd nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated renesas electronics corporation samsung lsi and stericsson 

 

manufacturing 

 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested and the wafer is cut into pieces called chips each chip is assembled into a package that then is usually retested the entire process typically requires between 12 and 18 weeks and takes place in highly specialized facilities 

 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia and europe these include both highvolume wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity potentially hurting our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins 

 

  

  

the cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors vary by product our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using older less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as our wireless products advanced logic wafer manufacturing continually requires new and expensive processes and equipment in contrast the processes and equipment required for manufacturing our analog products and most of our embedded processing products do not have this requirement 

 

in 2010 we continued to expand our analog manufacturing capacity through the acquisitions of wafer fabrication facilities in japan and china and the purchase and installation of analog wafer manufacturing equipment these manufacturing assets were purchased at very costeffective pricing such that the impact to depreciation resulting from these fixed cost assets will be minimal in total the equipment and factories purchased at discounted prices since late 2009 will support more than 5 billion of total additional revenue once fully operational 

 

to supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries we source about 25 percent of our wafers from external foundries with the vast majority of this outsourcing being for advanced logic wafers in 2010 external foundries provided 60 percent of the fabricated wafers for our advanced logic manufacturing needs we expect the proportion of our advanced logic wafers provided by foundries will increase over time we expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet the vast majority of our analog production needs 

 

in addition to using foundries to supplement our wafer fabrication capacity we selectively use subcontractors to supplement our assemblytest capacity we generally use subcontractors for assemblytest of products that would be less costefficient to complete inhouse eg relatively lowvolume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized or when demand temporarily exceeds our internal capacity we believe we often have a cost advantage from maintaining internal assemblytest capacity 

 

our internalexternal manufacturing strategy reduces the level of our required capital expenditures and thereby reduces our subsequent levels of depreciation below what it would be if we sourced all manufacturing internally consequently we experience less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand and lower cash requirements for expanding and updating our manufacturing capabilities 

 

inventory 

our inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand because of the longer product life cycles of standard products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence we generally carry more of those products than custom products additionally we sometimes maintain standardproduct inventory in unfinished wafer form as well as higher finished goods inventory of low volume products allowing greater flexibility in periods of high demand we also have consignment inventory programs in place for our largest customers and some distributors 

 

design centers 

 

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

 

customers 

 

our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies which then sell those products under their own brand our largest single customer in 2010 was an oem the nokia group of companies sales to nokia were about 19 percent of our revenue in 2010 about twothirds of the nokiarelated revenue was from baseband products 

 

  

  

sales and distribution 

 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales or marketing offices in over 30 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe over the last few years distributors located around the world account for about 37 percent of our revenue our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of distributorowned and ticonsigned inventory over time we expect this mix will shift more toward consignment we sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us 

 

backlog 

 

we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period our backlog of orders was 175 billion at december 31 2010 and 179 billion at december 31 2009 

 

raw materials 

 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

 

intellectual property 

 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

 

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies 

 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include omap tm and dlp ®  

 

research and development 

 

our primary area of rd investment is analog and embedded processing products we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of third parties including software suppliers universities and select external industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology 

 

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion 

 

  

  

our rd expense was 157 billion in 2010 compared with 148 billion in 2009 and 194 billion in 2008 the lower levels of rd expense in recent years are largely the result of our decision to discontinue rd for wireless baseband products

 item 1a risk factors 

 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

 

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

 

semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key endequipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

 

our margins may vary over time 

 

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

 

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets and also from emerging companies particularly in asia that sell products into the same markets in which we operate certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

 

  

  

with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology 

 

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

 

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries and from sales to industrial customers within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our global manufacturing design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide and about 90 percent of our revenue comes from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

 

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

  

  

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing services 

 

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us 

 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 

 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

 

our operations could be affected by changes in environmental safety and health laws and regulations 

we are subject to environmental safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business particularly those in which we manufacture our products if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business particularly if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available or be available at reasonable cost 

 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

 

we maintain bank accounts a multiyear revolving credit agreement and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business and make strategic acquisitions requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

 

material impairments of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations 

charges associated with impairments of our goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill 

 

  

  

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

 

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require

company overview 

at ti we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 we are incorporated in delaware headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries we have four segments analog embedded processing wireless and other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segments 

we were the world’s fourth largest semiconductor company in 2009 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from an external source additionally we sell calculators and related products 

financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “segment and geographic area data” on pages 29 and 30 of ti’s 2009 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

product information 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine multiple transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit   our semiconductors are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution our portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment 

we sell custom and standard semiconductor products custom products are designed for a specific customer for a specific application are sold only to that customer and are typically sold directly to the customer the life cycles of custom products are generally determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months standard products are designed for use by many customers andor many applications and are generally sold through both distribution and direct channels they include both proprietary and commodity products the life cycles of standard products are generally longer than for custom products 

additional information regarding each segment’s products follows 

analog 

analog semiconductors change realworld signals – such as sound temperature pressure or images – by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors such as digital signal processors dsps analog semiconductors are also used to manage power distribution and consumption sales to our analog segment’s nearly 80000 customers generated about 40 percent of our revenue in 2009 according to external sources the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about 32 billion in 2009 our analog segment’s revenue in 2009 was 43 billion or about 13 percent of this market the leading position we believe that we are wellpositioned to increase our market share over time 

our analog product lines are highperformance analog highvolume analog  logic and power management 

highperformance analog products these include standard analog semiconductors such as amplifiers data converters and interface semiconductors our portfolio includes more than 15000 products that we market to many different customers who use them in manufacturing a wide range of products sold in many end markets including the industrial communications computing and consumer electronics markets highperformance analog products generally have long life cycles often more than 10 years 

highvolume analog  logic products highvolume analog includes products for specific applications including custom products the life cycles of our highvolume analog products are generally shorter than those of our highperformance analog products end markets for highvolume analog products include communications automotive computing and many consumer electronics products logic and standard linear includes commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applications 

  

  

power management products these include both standard and custom semiconductors that help customers manage power in any type of electronic system we design and manufacture power management semiconductors for both portable devices batterypowered devices such as handheld consumer electronics laptop computers and cordless power tools and linepowered systems products that require an external electrical source such as computers digital tvs wireless base stations and highvoltage industrial equipment 

embedded processing 

our embedded processing products include our dsps other than dsps specific to our wireless segment and microcontrollers dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data microcontrollers are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment sales of embedded processing products generated about 15 percent of our revenue in 2009 the worldwide market for embedded processors was about 14 billion in 2009 according to external sources we have about 11 percent share in this fragmented market and we believe we are wellpositioned to increase our market share over time 

an important characteristic of our embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next we make and sell standard or catalog embedded processing products used in many different applications and custom embedded processing products used in specific applications such as communications infrastructure equipment and automotive 

wireless 

cell phones require a modem or “baseband” to connect to the wireless carrier’s network many of today’s advanced cell phones which contain email media games and computing capability also require an applications processor to run the phone’s software and services and semiconductors to enable connectivity to bluetooth ® devices wifi networks or gps location services we design make and sell products to satisfy each of these requirements wireless products are typically sold in high volumes and our wireless portfolio includes both standard products and custom products sales of wireless products generated about 25 percent of our revenue in 2009 and a significant portion of our wireless sales were to a single customer 

our wireless segment has shifted focus from baseband chips a market with shrinking competitive barriers and slowing growth rates to applications processors and connectivity products markets we expect will grow faster than the baseband market consistent with this shift in market focus we are concentrating our wireless investments on our omap tm applications processors and connectivity products and have discontinued further development of standard baseband products while we continue to sell custom baseband products we have discontinued essentially all custom baseband investment we expect substantially all of our baseband revenue which was 173 billion in 2009 to cease by the end of 2012 

other 

our other segment includes revenue from sales from our smaller semiconductor product lines and of our handheld graphing and scientific calculators as well as royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies the semiconductor products in our other segment include dlp® products primarily used in projectors to create highdefinition images reducedinstruction set computing risc microprocessors designed to provide very fast computing and often implemented in servers and custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics this segment generated about 20 percent of our revenue in 2009 

applications for our products 

the table below lists the major end markets that use our products and the approximate percentage of our product revenue that the market represents the chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets 

  

  

 

market characteristics 

product cycle 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing processes semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature typically new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to highvolume production over time 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity this cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

  

  

seasonality 

our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation our semiconductor sales generally are seasonally weaker in the first quarter than in other quarters particularly for products sold into cell phones and other consumer electronics devices which have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the major holiday selling seasons calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and is therefore at its highest in the second and third quarters royalty revenue is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

competitive landscape 

in each segment we face significant global competition from numerous large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line technological innovation technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale with expertise in both analog and embedded processing  we believe we are capable of providing bestinclass solutions and systemlevel knowledge to help our customers create more advanced systems and products and bring their products to market sooner 

the primary competitive factors for our analog products include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and manufacturing expertise our primary analog competitors include analog devices inc freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation nxp bv richtek technology corporation and stmicroelectronics nv 

the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications support and a product’s performance and power characteristics primary competitors of our embedded processing segment include atmel corporation freescale semiconductor inc microchip technology inc nec electronics renesas technology corp and stmicroelectronics nv 

the primary competitive factors for our wireless products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications support and a product’s performance and power characteristics primary wireless competitors include broadcom corp csr plc freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag intel corporation marvell technology group ltd nvidia corporation qualcomm incorporated and stericsson 

manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested and the wafer is cut into pieces called chips each chip is assembled into a package that then may be retested the entire process typically requires between 12 and 18 weeks and takes place in highly specialized facilities 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia and europe these include both highvolume wafer fabrication and assemblytest facilities our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity potentially hurting our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins 

the cost and lifespan of the equipment and processes we use to manufacture semiconductors varies by product our analog products and most of our embedded processing products can be manufactured using older less expensive equipment than is needed for manufacturing advanced logic products such as our wireless products advanced logic wafer manufacturing continually requires new and expensive processes and equipment in contrast the processes and equipment required for manufacturing our analog products and most of our embedded processing products do not have this requirement 

to supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and return on capital expenditures our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries our strategy involves installing internal wafer fabrication capacity to a level we believe will remain fully utilized over the equipment’s useful lifetime and then outsourcing remaining capacity needs to foundries in 2009 external foundries provided about 55 percent of the fabricated wafers for our advanced logic manufacturing needs we expect the proportion of our advanced logic wafers provided by foundries will increase over time we expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet the vast majority of our analog production needs 

  

  

in addition to using foundries to supplement our wafer fabrication capacity we selectively use subcontractors to supplement our assemblytest capacity we generally use subcontractors for assemblytest of products that would be less costefficient to complete inhouse eg relatively lowvolume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized or when demand temporarily exceeds our internal capacity we believe we often have a cost advantage in maintaining internal assemblytest capacity 

our internalexternal manufacturing strategy reduces the level of our required capital expenditures and thereby reduces our subsequent levels of depreciation below what it would be if we sourced all manufacturing internally consequently we experience less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand and lower cash requirements for expanding and updating our manufacturing capabilities 

in 2009 to expand our existing wafer fabrication capacity we began installing equipment in the industry’s first 300millimeter analog wafer factory located in richardson texas and are currently qualifying for production we also opened a new assemblytest facility in the philippines to significantly increase our assemblytest capacity 

inventory 

our inventory practices differ by product but we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand because of the longer product life cycles of standard products and their inherently lower risk of obsolescence we generally carry more of those products than custom products additionally we sometimes maintain standardproduct inventory in unfinished wafer form allowing greater flexibility to meet final package and test configurations 

as a result of two multiyear trends in general we expect to carry higher levels of inventory relative to our revenue expectations commonly viewed by investors as days of inventory than in past years first standard products have become a larger part of our portfolio second we have increased consignment programs for our largest customers and some distributors and as a result we now carry more inventory on average than in the past in order to service the needs of these customers 

design centers 

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

customers 

our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies which then sell those products under their own brand our largest single customer in 2009 was an oem the nokia group of companies sales to nokia were about 20 percent of our revenue in 2009 and a majority of this revenue was in our wireless segment 

sales and distribution 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales or marketing offices in over 30 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe over the last few years distributors located around the world account for about 30 percent of our revenue our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of distributorowned and ticonsigned inventory over time we expect this mix will shift more toward consignment we sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

  

  

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us 

backlog 

we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period our backlog of orders was 179 billion at december 31 2009 and 086 billion at december 31 2008 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include omap tm and dlp ®  

research and development 

our primary area of rd investment is analog and embedded processing products we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of universities and select external industry consortia and we collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology 

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion 

our rd expense was 148 billion in 2009 compared with 194 billion in 2008 and 214 billion in 2007 the recent decrease in our rd expense is largely the result of our decisions to discontinue rd for advanced logic manufacturing and wireless baseband products

risk factors 

tableend 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

  

  

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if this market or key endequipment markets grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

our margins may vary over time 

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed in general these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology 

  

  

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries within these industries a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

our global manufacturing design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide and in 2009 about 90 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results additionally in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing services 

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us 

  

  

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxrelated matters 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

our operations could be affected by changes in environmental safety and health laws and regulations 

we are subject to environmental safety and health laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate our business particularly those in which we manufacture our products if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines penalties or other legal liability furthermore should these laws and regulations be amended or expanded or new ones enacted we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business particularly if such laws and regulations require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes or impose costs fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy or of materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products there can be no assurance that in all instances a substitute for a prohibited raw material or process would be available or be available at reasonable cost 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts a multiyear revolving credit agreement and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business and make strategic acquisitions requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

material impairments of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations 

charges associated with impairments of our goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise or upon the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit the review compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated book value including goodwill a decrease in the fair value associated with a reporting unit resulting from among other things unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flow of the reporting unit may require us to recognize impairments of goodwill 

  

  

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require

 item 1 business 

company overview 

at texas instruments incorporated ti we design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world we began operations in 1930 and are incorporated in delaware we are headquartered in dallas texas and have design manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries we have four segments analog embedded processing wireless and other we expect analog and embedded processing to be our primary growth engines in the years ahead and we therefore focus our resources on these segments 

we were the world’s fourth largest semiconductor company in 2008 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from an external source additionally we sell calculators and related products 

financial information with respect to our segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “segment and geographic area data” on pages 31 and 32 of ti’s 2008 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

product information 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine different transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our semiconductors are used to accomplish many different things such as converting and amplifying signals interfacing with other devices managing and distributing power processing data canceling noise and improving signal resolution our portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment 

we sell two general categories of semiconductor products custom and standard a custom product is designed for a specific customer for a specific application is sold only to that customer and is typically sold directly to the customer a standard product is designed for use by many customers andor many applications and is generally sold through both distribution and direct channels standard products include both proprietary and commodity products 

additional information regarding each segment’s products follows 

analog 

analog semiconductors change realworld signals – such as sound temperature pressure or images – by conditioning them amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data so the signals can be processed by other semiconductors such as digital signal processors dsps analog semiconductors are also used to manage power distribution and consumption sales from our analog segment accounted for about 40 percent of our revenue in 2008 the worldwide market for analog semiconductors was about 36 billion in 2008 according to external sources we have about a 12 percent share in the fragmented analog semiconductor market which is a leading position we believe that we are well positioned to increase our share over time 

during 2008 we discussed our analog business by reference to highperformance analog and highvolume analog  logic 

highperformance analog products these include standard analog semiconductors such as amplifiers data converters lowpower radio frequency devices and interface and power management semiconductors our standard analog portfolio includes more than 20000 products that we market to many different customers nearly 80000 who use them in a wide range of products across the industrial communications computing and consumer markets highperformance analog products generally have long life cycles often 10 to 20 years 

highvolume analog  logic products these include two product types the first highvolume analog includes products for specific applications including custom products for specific customers the life cycles of our highvolume analog products are generally shorter than those of our highperformance analog products end markets for highvolume analog products include communications automotive computing and many consumer electronics products the second product type standard linear and logic includes commodity products marketed to many different customers for many different applications 

beginning with the first quarter of 2009 we will discuss power management semiconductors as a separate category of analog products separating it from the highperformance category 

embedded processing 

our embedded processing products include our dsps other than dsps specific to our wireless segment and microcontrollers dsps perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process and improve digital data microcontrollers are microprocessors that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment sales of embedded processing products accounted for about 15 percent of our revenue in 2008 the worldwide market for embedded processors was about 17 billion in 2008 according to external sources we have about a 10 percent share in this fragmented market and we believe we are well positioned to increase our share over time 

an important characteristic of embedded processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development rd to write software that operates on our products this investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next we make and sell standard or catalog embedded processing products used in many different applications and custom embedded processing products used in specific applications such as communications infrastructure equipment and automotive 

wireless 

cell phones require a modem or “baseband” to connect to the wireless carrier’s network many of today’s advanced cell phones also require an applications processor to run the phone’s software and services and semiconductors to enable connectivity to bluetooth ® devices wifi networks or gps location services we design make and sell products to satisfy each of these requirements wireless products are typically sold in high volumes and our wireless portfolio includes both standard or merchant products and custom products sales of wireless products accounted for about 25 percent of our revenue in 2008 and a significant portion of our wireless sales were to a single customer 

as wireless communications have proliferated consumers have demanded capabilities beyond voice smartphones phones that contain email media games and computing capability represent one of the fastest growing wireless markets these phones tend to include many semiconductor products major handset manufacturers are actively pursuing the smartphone market and increasingly focusing their rd on applications and services as a result we believe customer demand for applications processors will grow as handset manufacturers seek to differentiate their products by providing software and a unique user experience our omap tm product line has a leading position in the applications processor market and is used by most of the top handset manufacturers 

our wireless segment has been shifting focus from baseband chips a market with shrinking competitive barriers and slowing growth rates to applications processors a market we expect will grow faster than the baseband market consistent with this shift in market focus we are concentrating our wireless investments on our applications processors and connectivity products we continue to sell custom baseband products but have discontinued further development of merchant baseband products 

other 

our other segment includes revenue from smaller semiconductor product lines and handheld graphing and scientific calculators and from royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies the semiconductor products in our other segment include dlp ® products primarily used to create highdefinition images for business and home theater projectors televisions and movie projectors reducedinstruction set computing risc microprocessors designed to provide very fast computing and often implemented in servers and custom semiconductors known as applicationspecific integrated circuits asics this segment accounted for about 20 percent of our revenue in 2008 

applications for our products

market characteristics 

product cycle 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing methods chip prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing methods and product life cycles mature typically new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to highvolume production over time 

market cycle 

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply with relatively stable demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand andor excess manufacturing capacity this cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

although there are similarities with past cycles we do not believe the market environment in the second half of 2008 and early 2009 is simply a surplusdriven inventory correction instead we believe it is a broad economic slowdown in which consumer and industrial consumption has dramatically weakened and likely will weaken further 

seasonality 

our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation sales of our semiconductor products are seasonally weaker in the first quarter than in other quarters particularly for products sold into cell phones and consumer electronics applications that have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the holiday selling season calculator revenue is tied to the us backtoschool season and as a result is at its highest in the second and third quarters royalty revenue is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

competitive landscape 

in each segment we face significant global competition from numerous large and small companies including both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line technological innovation technical support customer service quality reliability price and scale with expertise in both digital signal processing and analog at the system level we believe we are capable of providing bestinclass products that integrate both technologies onto a single chip in addition our ability to deliver integrated solutions and systemlevel knowledge allows our customers to create more advanced systems and products and bring their products to market sooner 

the primary competitive factors in the analog market include design proficiency a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and manufacturing expertise our primary analog competitors include analog devices inc freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag intersil corporation linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation nxp bv and stmicroelectronics nv 

the primary competitive factors for our embedded processing products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications support and a product’s performance and power characteristics primary competitors of our embedded processing segment include freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag nec electronics and renesas technology corp 

the primary competitive factors for our wireless products are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets installed base of software software expertise applications support and a product’s performance and power characteristics primary wireless competitors include broadcom corp freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag marvell technology group ltd qualcomm incorporated and stmicroelectronics nv 

manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with the wafer fabrication manufacturing process a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested and the wafer is cut into pieces called chips each chip is assembled into a package that then may be retested the entire process typically requires between twelve and eighteen weeks and takes place in highly specialized facilities 

we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing sites in north america asia and europe these facilities include highvolume wafer fabrication plants and assemblytest sites our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of capacity and can adversely affect our profit margins as a result conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins 

most of our analog semiconductors require a lower level of capital investment in manufacturing and equipment than is needed for equivalent production levels of our embedded processing and wireless semiconductors which are manufactured using advanced logic wafer manufacturing equipment while analog chips benefit from unique proprietary wafer manufacturing processes these processes can be applied using older less expensive equipment in addition these processes and equipment remain usable for much longer than the manufacturing processes and equipment required for advanced logic wafer manufacturing 

to supplement our internal advanced logic wafer fabrication capacity maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and minimize our overall capital expenditures our wafer manufacturing strategy utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries our strategy involves installing internal wafer fabrication capacity to a level we believe will remain fully utilized over the equipment’s useful lifetime and then outsourcing remaining capacity needs to foundries in 2008 external foundries provided about 50 percent of the fabricated wafers for our advanced logic manufacturing needs but during the fourth quarter of 2008 we significantly reduced our foundry purchases we expect the proportion of our advanced logic wafers provided by foundries will increase over time we expect to maintain sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet substantially all our analog production needs 

in addition to using foundries to supplement our wafer fabrication capacity we selectively use subcontractors to supplement our assemblytest capacity we generally use subcontractors for assemblytest of products that would be less costefficient to complete inhouse eg relatively lowvolume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized or in the event demand temporarily exceeds our internal capacity we believe we often have a cost advantage in maintaining internal assemblytest capacity accordingly we have nearly completed an environmentally efficient assemblytest facility in the philippines and the facility is in the initial stages of production 

this internalexternal manufacturing strategy is designed to reduce the level of our required capital expenditures and thereby reduce our subsequent levels of depreciation expected end results include less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand and lower cash requirements for expanding and updating our manufacturing capabilities as our internal manufacturing efforts shift to a higher percentage of analog products an increasing proportion of our capital expenditures is devoted to assemblytest facilities and equipment this is primarily due to the lower capital needs of analog wafer manufacturing equipment 

inventory 

while our inventory practices differ by product we generally maintain inventory levels that are consistent with our expectations of customer demand 

for custom semiconductor products where the risk of obsolescence is higher we carry lower levels of inventory when possible these products have a single customer are sold in high volumes and have comparatively shorter life cycles life cycles of these products are often determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months 

for standard semiconductor products where the risk of obsolescence is low we generally carry higher levels of inventory these products usually have many customers and long life cycles and are often ordered in small quantities standard product inventory is sometimes held in unfinished wafer form giving us greater flexibility to meet final package and test configurations 

as a result of the following trends we now tend to carry relatively higher levels of inventory than in past years standard products have become a larger part of our portfolio we have increased consignment programs with our largest customers and our distributors now carry relatively less inventory on average than in the past 

we manage calculator inventory consistent with expected seasonality 

design centers 

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

customers 

our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies which then sell those products under their own brand our largest single customer in 2008 was an oem the nokia group of companies sales to nokia were about 20 percent of our revenue in 2008 and a majority of this revenue was in our wireless segment 

sales and distribution 

we market and sell our semiconductor products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales or marketing offices in over 30 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe distributors located around the world account for about 30 percent of our revenue and a majority of our revenue from many standard products our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors our distribution network holds a mix of distributorowned and ticonsigned inventory over time we expect this mix will shift more toward consignment we sell our calculator products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us 

backlog 

we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period we ship a substantial number of orders in the quarter in which they are received our backlog of orders was 086 billion at december 31 2008 and 150 billion at december 31 2007 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to our revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include omap tm and dlp ®  

research and development 

our primary area of rd investment is analog and embedded processing products we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of external industry consortia and universities and collaborate with our foundry suppliers on semiconductor manufacturing technology 

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute significant revenue until at least a few years following completion 

our rd expense was 194 billion in 2008 compared with 214 billion in 2007 and 220 billion in 2006

 item 1a risk factors 

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions actual financial results that do not meet our andor the investment community’s expectations changes in our andor the investment community’s expectations for our future results and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

semiconductor products are the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for our semiconductors decreases or if these markets or key endequipment markets such as communications consumer electronics computing automotive and industrial grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

our margins may vary over time 

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or utilization of manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from smaller competitors serving niche markets certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims 

with regard to our own intellectual property we actively enforce and protect our rights however there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology 

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries within these industries a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

our global manufacturing design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide and in 2008 more than 85 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results also as discussed in more detail on page 47 of our 2008 annual report to stockholders we use forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the adverse earnings impact exchange rate fluctuations may have on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing services 

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we also depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development a limited number of third parties perform these functions and we do not have longterm contracts with all of them reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxation 

we have facilities in more than 30 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business and make strategic acquisitions requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments if our customers or suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity we may receive fewer customer orders or be unable to obtain needed supplies collect accounts receivable or access needed technology 

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require

financial information with respect to our business segments and our operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “segment and geographic area data” on pages 39 through 41 of ti’s 2007 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

the company began operations in 1930 and is incorporated in delaware 

semiconductor segment 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside of modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine different transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our semiconductor segment designs manufactures and sells integrated circuits 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing methods typically new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to highvolume production over time chip prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing methods and product life cycles mature 

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strong demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus products caused by declining demand andor excess manufacturing capacity this cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

we were the world’s fourth largest semiconductor company in 2007 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from an external source historically our semiconductor segment averages a significantly higher growth rate than our education technology segment 

the majority of our semiconductor revenue comes from our core products analog semiconductors and digital signal processors or dsps these products enhance and often make possible a variety of applications that serve the communications computer consumer electronics automotive and industrial markets we believe that virtually all of today’s electronic equipment requires some form of analog or digital signal processing 

we also design and manufacture other types of semiconductors such as microcontrollers used in safetycritical automotive applications dlp ® products that enable exceptionally clear video and microprocessors that serve as the brains of highend computer servers 

knowledge about the systems our products go into is becoming increasingly important because it enables us to differentiate our product offerings for our customers where a customer may previously have required multiple chips for a system to operate we are now integrating the functionality of those multiple chips onto a few or even a single chip because we have both the systemlevel knowledge and the manufacturing technology to do so an example is our singlechip cell phone solution which combines the functionality of many separate chips onto one the digitization of electronics also requires more highperformance analog functionality with expertise in both digital signal processing and analog at the system level we believe we are one of a very few semiconductor companies capable of integrating both technologies onto a single chip 

in addition we enable our customers particularly original design manufacturers odms to take advantage of our systemlevel knowledge and thereby speed their time to market by making available to them standard chipsets and reference designs an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies those other companies then sell the products under their 

  

own brands a chipset is a group of integrated circuits based principally on our technology that are designed to work together for a specific application and are therefore packaged and sold as a unit reference designs are technical blueprints that contain all the essential elements of a system customers using our reference designs such as cell phone odms may enhance or modify the design as they require our ability to deliver integrated solutions and systemlevel knowledge allows our customers to create more advanced systems and products 

in each of our product categories we face significant competition we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market depends upon several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line technological innovation quality reliability price customer service technical support and scale 

following is detailed information on each product category 

analog 

analog semiconductors connect digital signal processors and other types of logic devices to the outside world taking realworld signals such as sound temperature pressure and visual images conditioning them amplifying them and converting them into digital form and back into realworld signals they also help manage power distribution and consumption aspects critical to today’s portable electronic devices 

the analog semiconductor market is diverse and complex and it is one of the largest sectors of the semiconductor industry according to external sources we are the world’s largest supplier of analog semiconductors analog chips generated about 40 percent of our semiconductor revenue in 2007 and we expect analog to be the primary growth driver for the company in the years ahead 

our analog product portfolio includes custom mixedsignal products that are designed to a particular customer’s or application’s specifications these products account for about 50 percent of our analog revenue the remainder of our analog revenue comes from standard products that are sold across a range of customers and applications about 45 percent of our analog revenue is from highperformance standard products and about 5 percent is from commodity standard products 

many of our custom and standard products are proprietary and difficult for competitors to imitate many standard analog chips tend to have long life spans 

our mixedsignal products combine multiple types of analog functionality or analog and digital functions on a single chip purchasers of our custom mixedsignal products tend to be very large companies that require highvolume designs for specific applications such as communications displays printers and automotive entry into this market requires significant upfront investment as well as expertise in both analog and digital functionality the primary competitive factors in this market include design proficiency and manufacturing expertise and scale 

in the standard analog chip subcategory known as highperformance analog we have a portfolio of about 20000 products including data converters amplifiers power management devices and interface chips our highperformance analog products are used by more than 50000 customers who incorporate our products into a variety of devices sold both in established markets such as for industrial communications computer and consumer devices and in emerging product markets such as for medical devices these products are sold primarily through distributors prices in this market tend to be stable with relatively high gross profit margins the primary competitive factors are a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs and manufacturing process technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance products with higher levels of performance tend to command a premium price 

our other standard analog chips are commodity in nature we design and manufacture thousands of lowcost highvolume standard products that are sold primarily through distributors end applications are very diverse and include portable electronic devices and communications the primary competitive factors in this market are price and availability pricing is strongly influenced by supply and demand 

overall in the analog market we compete globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our primary competitors include analog devices inc freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation nxp bv and stmicroelectronics nv 

  

digital signal processors or dsps 

dsps use complex algorithms and compression techniques to alter and improve a data stream dsps perform these functions instantaneously and powerefficiently these products are ideal for applications that require precise realtime processing of realworld analog signals that have been converted into digital form their power efficiency is important for batterypowered devices 

combining dsp and analog functionality enables a broad range of significant applications in a cell phone the process works as follows 1 the sender’s voice is picked up by an analog sensor in the cell phone’s microphone 2 an analogtodigital converter chip changes the analog sound waves of the sender’s voice into a digital code 3 the dsp compresses these digital signals and removes background noise and 4 in the listener’s cell phone the digital code is converted back into the analog sound of the sender’s voice all this happens in real time 

we offer programmable dsps which among other benefits enable manufacturers to differentiate their product designs via software rather than having to design new hardware according to external sources we are the world’s largest dsp supplier dsps represent about 40 percent of our semiconductor revenue 

our dsp portfolio includes custom applicationspecific and standard products custom products are designed for specific customers with very high volumes in established markets applicationspecific products are implementations crafted for specific applications such as wireless infrastructure voip voice over internet protocol gateways video image enhancement medical digital still cameras and residential gateways to name a few our standard dsp products are sold into a broad range of applications and seed the next generation of signalprocessing innovation 

about 80 percent of our dsp revenue comes from the cell phone market to satisfy diverse customer needs our portfolio of products for cell phone applications consists of both custom and standard products these products are typically highly integrated semiconductor devices that allow our customers to differentiate their cell phone products from their competitors’ products through performance long battery life features or cost also included in our dspbased wireless portfolio are the widely used omap™ processors which are highperformance processors that enable multimedia applications in cell phones and other electronic devices 

in the dsp market we compete globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased and niche suppliers of dsps as well as suppliers of other technologies that deliver functionality that competes with dsps primary competitive factors are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise and applications support our primary competitors in the dsp market are analog devices inc freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag and nxp bv others who offer competing technologies include broadcom corp marvell technology group ltd mediatek inc and qualcomm incorporated 

other semiconductor products 

our other semiconductor products which combined account for about 20 percent of our semiconductor revenue include the following 

dlp ® products 

our dlp technology is a digital display technology used in projectors and highdefinition televisions hdtvs projectors based on this technology are used in businesses homes professional venues and increasingly in movie theaters the technology consists of microelectromechanical devices that use optical semiconductors to digitally manipulate light at the center of every dlp product is an array of up to 22 million microscopic mirrors each mirror tilts back and forth thousands of times each second to create a high resolution highly reliable full color image this technology is used by more than 50 of the world’s top projector and television manufacturers 

our dlp technology competes against other display technologies such as liquid crystal display lcd based projectors and flatscreen lcd and plasmabased hdtvs  the primary competitive elements in this market include picture quality product form factors reliability and price 

  

reduced instructionset computing risc microprocessors 

a microprocessor is the central processing unit of a computer system risc microprocessors are designed to provide very fast computing typically for a specialized application such as servers our risc products are primarily 64bit microprocessors designed by sun microsystems inc for use in sun servers 

microcontrollers 

a microcontroller is a microprocessor designed to control a very specific task for electronic equipment key applications for our microcontrollers include personal medical automotive utility meters portable consumer products industrial applications motor controls and digital power management primary competitive factors in this market include integration of control peripherals for reduced board space and number of components ultralow power consumption an easytouse integrated development environment for fast system development and a broad range of microcontroller solutions for upgradeability and flexibility in system design 

standard logic 

standard logic devices are chips generally used to manage the interchange and manipulation of signals within a system a substantial number of our standard logic products are considered commodities for which price and delivery are the key competitive factors we sell thousands of different standard logic products primarily to distributors end applications include consumer products and communications 

royalties 

an additional source of revenue for ti is royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies 

applications for our semiconductor products 

the table below lists the major end markets that use our semiconductor products and the approximate percentage of our semiconductor revenue that the market represents the chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets 

 

 manufacturing 

semiconductor manufacturing begins with the wafer fabrication manufacturing process a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is tested and the wafer is cut into pieces called chips each chip is assembled into a package that then may be retested the entire process typically requires between twelve and eighteen weeks and takes place in highly specialized facilities 

  

digital products require the most advanced and most capitalintensive wafer fabrication manufacturing processes and equipment digital products tend to move to more advanced processes and equipment every few years as a result maintaining an industryleadership position in digital manufacturing requires significant capital spending along with investment in research and development rd in order to develop new manufacturing processes and capabilities 

analog products typically do not require the same level of advanced wafer fabrication manufacturing processes and equipment as digital products although analog products benefit from unique proprietary manufacturing processes these processes can be applied using older lessexpensive equipment additionally analog manufacturing processes and equipment remain usable for production for much longer than digital manufacturing processes and equipment consequently for equivalent capacity the level of capital and rd spending needed to support analog manufacturing is considerably less than is needed for digital manufacturing 

we have semiconductor manufacturing facilities in north america asia and europe these facilities include highvolume wafer fabrication plants and assemblytest sites to support our future manufacturing needs our environmentally efficient richardson texas wafer fabrication facility rfab is complete and ready for equipment installation allowing for rapid increases of digital or analog capacity whenever the market demands in addition an environmentally efficient assemblytest facility in the philippines is now under construction with initial production planned in the second half of 2008 

our semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once operating because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline when customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop potentially hurting our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output potentially benefiting our profit margins 

to supplement our internal wafer fabrication capacity maximize our responsiveness to customer demand and minimize our overall capital expenditures we have implemented a manufacturing strategy that utilizes the capacity of outside suppliers commonly known as foundries for advanced digital chips our strategy involves installing internal wafer fabrication capacity to a level we believe will remain fully utilized over the equipment’s useful lifetime and then outsourcing remaining capacity needs to foundries currently external foundries provide about 25 percent of our total wafers and about 50 percent of the wafers for our advanced digital products we expect the proportion of our advanced digital wafers provided by foundries will increase over time conversely we expect to install sufficient internal wafer fabrication capacity to meet substantially all our analog production needs 

  

in addition to using foundries to supplement our wafer fabrication needs we use subcontractors to supplement our assembly and test needs we generally use subcontractors for assemblytest of products it would be less costefficient to complete inhouse eg relatively lowvolume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized or in the event demand temporarily exceeds our internal capacity 

this internalexternal manufacturing strategy is designed to reduce the level of our required capital expenditures and thereby reduce our subsequent levels of depreciation expected end results include less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand and lower cash requirements for expanding and updating our manufacturing capabilities 

another element of our manufacturing strategy for digital chips involves working collaboratively with our foundry suppliers to develop future generations of digital wafer fabrication manufacturing process technology historically we have developed these manufacturing processes inhouse in 2007 we transitioned to a collaborative development model with our foundry suppliers this strategic shift will allow us to better serve customers with costeffective digital manufacturing process technology from our foundry suppliers while also increasing the efficiency of our own rd and capital we will continue to develop our own analog manufacturing process technologies 

inventory 

our inventory practices vary depending on the type of product for standard products where the risk of obsolescence is low we generally carry higher levels of inventory these products usually have many customers and long life cycles and are often ordered in small quantities standard product inventory is sometimes held in unfinished wafer form giving us greater flexibility to meet final package and test configurations examples of these products are highperformance analog standard dsps and standard microcontrollers for custom products where the risk of obsolescence is higher we carry lower levels of inventory when possible these products usually have a single customer are sold in high volumes and have comparatively shorter life cycles life cycles of these products are often determined by endequipment upgrade cycles and can be as short as 12 to 24 months examples of these products are digital baseband processors for cell phones and custom applicationspecific analog and digital products in addition our inventory levels have increased over time due to the impact of consignment programs at our largest customers our distributors’ desire to carry less inventory and our increased mix of standard products such as highperformance analog 

design centers 

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

customers 

our semiconductor products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others our largest single customer in 2007 was an oem the nokia group of companies direct sales to nokia were more than 15 percent of our revenue in 2007 and more than 10 percent of our revenue in 2006 

sales and distribution 

we market and sell our products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales or marketing offices in over 25 countries worldwide and have expanded our sales networks in the emerging markets of china india and eastern europe distributors located around the world account for about 30 percent of our overall semiconductor revenue and a majority of our revenue from many standard products eg highperformance analog standard dsp and standard logic products our distributors maintain an inventory of our products and sell directly to a wide range of customers they also sell products from our competitors

education technology is a leading supplier of graphing handheld calculators this business segment also provides its customers with business and scientific calculators and a wide range of advanced classroom tools and professional development resources to help students and teachers interactively explore math and science education technology relies on thirdparty manufacturers to build its products this segment contributed 4 percent of our 2007 revenue 

  

competition 

our principal competitors in this business are united states and japanbased companies including casio computer co ltd and hewlettpackard company the principal competitive factors are an understanding of the education market technology expertise and price 

sales and distribution 

education technology sells its products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us 

in july 2007 we completed the sale of our broadband digital subscriber line dsl customerpremises equipment semiconductor product line to infineon technologies ag for 61 million 

backlog 

we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a specified length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly we believe that our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period although we ship a substantial number of orders in the quarter in which they are received our backlog of orders was 150 billion at december 31 2007 and 164 billion at december 31 2006 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have agreements with numerous companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to semiconductor revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include dlp ® and omap tm  

research and development 

our primary area of rd investment is semiconductor products and semiconductor manufacturing technology we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of external industry consortia and universities and collaborate with our foundry suppliers 

  

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute to revenue until at least a few years following completion 

our rd expense was 215 billion in 2007 compared with 220 billion in 2006 and 199 billion in 2005 

seasonality 

our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation education technology experiences its strongest results in the second and third quarters in preparation for the backtoschool season the semiconductor segment generally is seasonally weaker in the first quarter than it is in other quarters particularly for products sold into cell phone and consumer electronics applications that have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the holiday selling season

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community and other factors beyond our control 

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

our semiconductor business is our largest business segment and the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market historically has been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could have adverse effects on our results of operations and on the market price of our securities in particular our strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for analog integrated circuits or digital signal processors decreases or if these markets or key endequipment markets such as communications consumer electronics and computing grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

our margins may vary over time 

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own much of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or our utilization of our manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products there also is no assurance that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers nor that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect the level of this competition will increase in the future from large established semiconductor and related product companies as well as from smaller companies serving niche markets certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products the price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies or technological product applications support software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors 

  

our performance depends in part upon our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others we may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others to the extent that we rely on licenses from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain them at all or on terms we consider reasonable the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims 

we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected technology 

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various patent license agreements the amount of such revenue depends in part on negotiations with new licensees and with existing licensees in connection with renewals of their licenses there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue also depends on the strength and enforceability of our patent portfolio and our enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally the consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries within these industries a large portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors to customers in the cell phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

our global manufacturing design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and in 2007 more than 80 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as the general political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate any of these could result in an adverse effect on our business operations and our financial results also as discussed in more detail on pages 58 and 59 of our 2007 annual report to stockholders we use forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and geological events that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our results and financial condition 

  

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in the given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing services 

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we also depend on third parties to provide advanced digital process technology development we depend on a limited number of third parties to perform these functions we do not have longterm contracts with all of these third parties reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand the third parties’ inability to develop and deliver advanced digital process technology in a timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of third parties imposing increased costs on us 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxation 

we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the appropriate jurisdiction to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in the financial markets 

we maintain bank accounts multiyear revolving credit agreements and a portfolio of liquid shortterm investments to support the financing needs of the company our ability to fund our daily operations invest in our business and make strategic acquisitions requires continuous access to our bank and investment accounts as well as access to our bank credit lines which support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through shortterm bank loans if we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines for example due to instability in the financial markets our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected similarly such circumstances could also restrict our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments 

  

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims or claims based on epidemic or delivery failures that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards the risk of a significant claim is generally greater for products used in health and safety applications in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we do maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty epidemic failure and delivery claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require

 item 1 business tableend company overview 

texas instruments incorporated ti is headquartered in dallas texas and has manufacturing design or sales operations in more than 25 countries we had two separate business segments in 2006 1 semiconductor which accounted for 96 percent of our revenue and 2 education technology which accounted for 4 percent of our revenue 

the year saw changes in our segments in january we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our former sensors  controls business and its results were reported as a discontinued operation the sale closed on april 27 2006 at the end of the year we decided to rename a segment to reflect its strategic focus educational  productivity solutions became education technology 

financial information with respect to ti’s business segments and operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “segment and geographic area data” on pages 32 and 33 of ti’s 2006 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

the company began operations in 1930 and is incorporated in delaware 

semiconductor segment 

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside of modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine different transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our semiconductor segment designs manufactures and sells integrated circuits 

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing methods typically new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to highvolume production over time chip prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing methods and product life cycles mature 

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strong demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus products caused by declining demand andor excess manufacturing capacity this cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

we were the world’s third largest semiconductor company in 2006 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from isuppli corporation an industry analyst historically our semiconductor segment averages a significantly higher growth rate than our education technology segment 

the majority of our semiconductor revenue comes from our core products which are analog semiconductors and digital signal processors or dsps these products enhance and often make possible a variety of applications that serve the communications computer consumer electronics automotive and industrial markets we believe that virtually all of today’s digital electronic equipment requires some form of analog or digital signal processing 

we also design and manufacture other types of semiconductors such as dlp ® products that enable exceptionally clear video and microprocessors that serve as the brains of highend computer servers 

knowledge about the systems our products go into is becoming increasingly important because it enables us to differentiate our product offerings for our customers where a customer may previously have required multiple chips for a system to operate we are now integrating the functionality of those multiple chips onto a few or even a single chip because we have both the systemlevel knowledge and the manufacturing technology to do so an example is our singlechip cell phone solution which combines the functionality of many separate chips onto one the digitization of electronics also requires more highperformance analog functionality with expertise in both digital signal processing and analog at the system level we believe we are one of a very few semiconductor companies capable of integrating both technologies onto a single chip 

in addition we enable our customers particularly original design manufacturers odms to take advantage of our systemlevel knowledge and thereby speed their time to market by making available to them standard chipsets and reference designs an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies those other companies then sell the products under their 

  

own brands a chipset is a group of integrated circuits based principally on our technology that are designed to work together for a specific application and are therefore packaged and sold as a unit reference designs are technical blueprints that contain all the essential elements of a system customers using our reference designs such as cellphone odms may enhance or modify the design as required our ability to deliver integrated solutions and systemlevel knowledge allows our customers to create more advanced systems and products 

in each of our product categories we face significant competition we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market depends upon several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line as well as technological innovation quality reliability price customer service technical support and scale 

following is detailed information on each product category 

analog 

analog semiconductors process “real world” inputs such as sound temperature pressure and visual images conditioning them amplifying them and converting them into digital signals they also assist in the management of power distribution and consumption aspects critical to today’s portable electronic devices 

the analog semiconductor market is diverse and complex and it is one of the largest sectors of the semiconductor industry we are the world’s largest supplier of analog semiconductors analog chips generated about 40 percent of our semiconductor revenue in 2006 

our analog product portfolio includes custom mixedsignal products that are designed to a particular customer’s or application’s specifications these products account for about 55 percent of our analog revenue the remainder of our analog revenue comes from standard products that are sold across a range of customers and applications about 40 percent of our analog revenue is from highperformance standard products and about 5 percent is from commodity standard products 

many of our custom and standard products are proprietary and difficult for competitors to imitate many standard analog chips tend to have long life spans 

our mixedsignal products combine multiple types of analog functionality or analog and digital functions on a single chip purchasers of our custom mixedsignal products tend to be very large companies that require highvolume designs for specific applications such as communications displays printers and automotive entry into this market requires significant upfront investment as well as expertise in both analog and digital functionality a primary competitive factor in this market is manufacturing expertise and scale 

in the standard analog chip subcategory known as highperformance analog we have a portfolio of about 15000 products including data converters amplifiers power management devices and interface chips our highperformance analog products are used by more than 50000 customers these products are sold primarily through distributors prices in this market tend to be stable with relatively high gross profit margins the primary competitive factors are a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs and manufacturing process technologies that allow us to provide differentiated levels of performance products with higher levels of performance tend to command a premium price 

other standard analog chips are commodity in nature we design and manufacture thousands of lowcost highvolume standard products that are sold primarily through distributors end applications are very diverse and include portable electronic devices and communications the primary competitive factors in this market are price and availability pricing is strongly influenced by supply and demand 

overall in the analog market we compete globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our primary competitors include analog devices inc freescale semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation nxp bv and stmicroelectronics nv 

digital signal processors or dsps 

dsp is one of the fastestgrowing sectors of the semiconductor industry we are the world’s largest dsp supplier and dsp represents about 40 percent of our semiconductor revenue 

dsps use complex algorithms and compression techniques to alter and improve a data stream dsps perform these functions instantaneously and powerefficiently these products are ideal for applications that require precise realtime processing of realworld analog signals that have been converted into digital form their power efficiency is important for batterypowered devices 

  

the combination of dsp with analog functionality enables a broad range of significant applications in a cell phone the process works as follows 1 the sender’s voice is picked up by an analog sensor in the cell phone’s microphone 2 an analogtodigital converter chip changes the analog sound waves of the sender’s voice into a digital code 3 the dsp compresses these digital signals and removes background noise and 4 in the listener’s cell phone the digital code is converted back into the analog sound of the sender’s voice all this happens in real time 

we offer programmable dsps which among other benefits enable manufacturers to differentiate their product designs via software rather than having to design new hardware 

our dsp portfolio includes custom applicationspecific and standard products custom products are designed for specific customers with very high volumes in established markets applicationspecific products are implementations crafted for specific applications like wireless infrastructure voip voice over internet protocol gateways digital still cameras and residential gateways to name a few our standard dsp products are sold into a broad range of applications and seed the next generation of signalprocessing innovation 

about 80 percent of our dsp revenue comes from the cellphone market most of which is derived from custom chips that we develop with large cellphone manufacturer customers these products are typically highly integrated semiconductor devices that allow our customers to differentiate their cellphone products from their competitors’ products through performance features or cost and are sold only to a single highvolume customer additional dsp revenue from this market comes from our sales of chipsets also included in our dspbased wireless portfolio are the widely used omap ™ processors which are highperformance processors that enable multimedia applications in cell phones and other electronic devices 

in the dsp market we compete globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased and niche suppliers of dsps as well as suppliers of other technologies that deliver functionality that competes with dsps primary competitive factors are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise and applications support our primary competitors in the dsp market are agere systems inc analog devices inc freescale semiconductor inc and nxp bv others who offer competing technologies include broadcom corp marvell technology group ltd and qualcomm incorporated 

other semiconductor products 

our other semiconductor products which combined account for about 20 percent of our semiconductor revenue include the following 

dlp ® products 

our dlp technology is a digital display technology used in projectors and highdefinition televisions projectors based on this technology are used in businesses homes professional venues and digital cinemas the technology consists of microelectromechanical devices that use optical semiconductors to digitally manipulate light at the center of every dlp product is an array of up to 22 million microscopic mirrors each mirror tilts back and forth thousands of times each second to create a high resolution highly reliable full color image this technology is used by more than 70 of the world’s top projector and television manufacturers since early 1996 when dlp products were first marketed ti has shipped more than 10 million dlp subsystems to customers all over the world

royalties 

an additional source of revenue for ti is royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies 

applications for our semiconductor products 

the table below lists the major end markets that use our semiconductor products and the approximate percentage of our semiconductor revenue that the market represents the chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets 

 

 manufacturing 

we have semiconductor manufacturing sites in north america japan asia and europe these facilities include highvolume wafer fabrication plants and assemblytest sites our semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once they are in operation because we own most of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline when 

  

customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop and this can hurt our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output which should benefit profit margins 

the semiconductor manufacturing process begins with a thin silicon wafer on which an array of semiconductor devices is fabricated the wafer is then tested cut into chips and assembled into packages that are then individually retested 

our advanced digital products require the most advanced and most capitalintensive manufacturing processes dsps and other digital products tend to move to more advanced production techniques every couple of years consequently maintaining an industry leadership position requires significant capital expenditures for new manufacturing capabilities 

our manufacturing strategy for advanced digital processes is to build internal capacity to a level we believe will remain fully utilized over the equipment’s asset lifetime we then outsource remaining capacity from outside suppliers including semiconductor foundries and assemblytest subcontractors we also outsource the manufacturing of some products when it would be less costefficient to make those products inhouse for instance relatively lowvolume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized this internalexternal strategy is designed to reduce the level of our required capital expenditures and thereby reduce our subsequent levels of depreciation the expected end result is less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand currently outside foundries provide about 25 percent of our total wafers produced 

another element of our manufacturing strategy is the development of advanced digital manufacturing processes we have traditionally developed these processes inhouse moving forward we will work collaboratively with our foundry suppliers to specify and drive the next generations of digital process technology instead of separately creating our own process technology we expect that our 32nanometer manufacturing process will be the first process technology developed entirely through this new collaboration this strategic shift will allow us to better serve customers with costeffective digital process technology from our foundry suppliers while increasing the efficiency of our own research and development rd and capital we will continue to develop our own analog process technologies 

as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we utilize less space per transistor which enables us to either 1 fit more transistors on an equivalentsize chip 2 decrease the chip’s size or 3 integrate new features onto the chip by shrinking the size of transistors we also can provide faster chips that consume less power and cost less per unit to manufacture 

our manufacturing capabilities are on par with the best in the semiconductor industry as of december 31 2006 we have shipped more than half a billion chips manufactured using 90nanometer process technology and our 65nanometer process is in the early stages of production our advanced semiconductor rd is now done sidebyside with production of 300millimeter mm wafers in our dallas dmos 6 fabrication plant 300mm wafers greatly expand the number of equivalent chips we can put on a single wafer compared with the previous 200mm wafers construction of our new 300mm wafer fabrication plant in richardson texas rfab has been completed 

in 2006 a majority of our advanced digital products were built using 130 or 90nanometer manufacturing process technology while devices using 65nanometer technology continued to increase throughout the year one nanometer is one billionth of a meter 

since analog manufacturing technology evolves more slowly than digital manufacturing technology analog products typically do not require us to build new manufacturing facilities this tends to improve the profit margin on analog products since the equipment on which they are manufactured is frequently fully depreciated 

design centers 

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service design the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

customers 

our semiconductor products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others our largest single customer in 2006 was an oem the nokia group of companies direct sales to nokia were more than 10 percent of our revenue in both 2005 and 2006 

  

sales and distribution 

we market and sell our products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales or marketing offices in over 25 countries worldwide distributors located around the world account for about 30 percent of our semiconductor revenue and they sell our products directly to a wide range of customers these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products they also sell products from our competitors 

education technology segment 

education technology is a leading supplier of graphing handheld calculators this business segment also provides its customers with business and scientific calculators and a wide range of advanced classroom tools and professional development resources to help students and teachers interactively explore math and science education technology relies on thirdparty manufacturers to build its products this segment contributed 4 percent of our 2006 revenue 

competition 

our principal competitors in this business are us and japanbased companies the principal competitive factors are an understanding of the education market technology expertise and price 

sales and distribution 

education technology sells its products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen or better focus our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us 

in january 2006 we closed the acquisition of chipcon group asa a leading company in the design of shortrange lowpower wireless radiofrequency rf transceiver devices chipcon’s product line complements our existing highperformance analog power management and ultralowpower microcontroller portfolio we paid 183 million in cash for chipcon 

in january 2006 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the sensors  control segment excluding the radio frequency identification rfid systems operations to an affiliate of bain capital llc for 3 billion in cash the sale was completed on april 27 2006 the rfid operations are now included in the semiconductor business segment 

backlog 

our backlog of orders was 164 billion at december 31 2006 and 188 billion at december 31 2005 a substantial number of orders are shipped during the quarter in which they are received we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customerrequested delivery date within a maximum length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly we believe that our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period 

raw materials 

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

intellectual property 

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have several agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

  

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to semiconductor revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies 

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include dlp ® and omap ™  

research and development 

our primary area of rd investment is semiconductor products and semiconductor manufacturing technology we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of external industry consortia and universities and collaborate with our foundry suppliers 

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute to revenue until at least a few years following completion 

our rd expense was 220 billion in 2006 compared with 199 billion in 2005 and 195 billion in 2004 

seasonality 

our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation education technology experiences its strongest results in the second and third quarters in preparation for the backtoschool season the semiconductor segment generally has a weak first quarter particularly in product areas such as wireless and consumer electronics that have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the holiday selling season

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community and other factors beyond our control 

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

our semiconductor business is our largest business segment and the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in product demand these changes could adversely affect our results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities in particular our strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for analog integrated circuits or digital signal processors decreases or if these markets or key endequipment markets such as communications entertainment electronics and computing grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

our margins may vary over time 

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own most of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or our utilization of our manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

  

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect that the level of this competition will increase in the future from large established semiconductor and related product companies as well as from emerging companies serving niche markets that we also serve certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against those of our products that currently offer technological andor price advantages over competitive products competition results in price and product development pressures which may result in reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match price declines or technological product applications support software or manufacturing advances of our competitors 

our performance depends in part upon our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others we may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others to the extent that we rely on licenses from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain all of the licenses we desire in the future on terms we consider reasonable or at all the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected technology 

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various license agreements some agreements expired in 2005 and 2006 and either have been or are currently being renegotiated others expire at the end of 2007 and in future years although we will attempt to renegotiate license agreements that expire in 2007 there is no guarantee that such negotiations will be successful future royalty revenue depends on the strength of our portfolio and enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally the consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries within these industries a large portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors to customers in the cellphone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

our global manufacturing design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and in 2006 more than 80 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as the general political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations also as discussed in more detail on page 55 of our 2006 annual report to stockholders we use forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or our customers’ or suppliers’ may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in the given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture product based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment manufacturing processes and thirdparty manufacturing services 

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we are also in the process of transitioning future advanced digital process technology development to third parties we depend on a limited number of third parties to perform these functions we do not have longterm contracts with all of these third parties reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand and their inability to develop and deliver advanced digital process technology in a timely and appropriate manner 

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxation 

we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate 

in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the appropriate jurisdiction to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we do maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may 

  

make in connection with warranty claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in the fourth quarter of 2006 italian government auditors completed a review conducted in the ordinary course of approximately 250 million of grants from the italian government to ti’s former memory operations in italy the ministry of industry which is responsible for reviewing the auditors’ findings has published final decrees on all projects relating to the grants resulting in a 28 million favorable settlement to ti in the fourth quarter of 2006 as of december 31 2006 ti has no material obligations remaining on the grants 

we are involved in various proceedings conducted by the federal environmental protection agency and certain other governmental environmental agencies regarding cleanup of contaminated sites these proceedings are being coordinated with the agencies and in certain cases with other potentially responsible parties although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ we believe that the amount of our liability will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

the internal revenue code requires that companies disclose in their form 10k whether they have been required to pay penalties to the internal revenue service for certain transactions that have been identified by the irs as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose we have not been required to pay any such penalties

company overview 

  

texas instruments incorporated ti is headquartered in dallas texas and has manufacturing design or sales operations in more than 25 countries we had three separate business segments in 2005 1 semiconductor which accounted for 87 percent of our revenue in 2005 2 sensors  controls which accounted for 9 percent of our revenue and 3 educational  productivity solutions which accounted for 4 percent of our revenue our largest geographic sources of revenue in descending order are asia excluding japan europe the united states and japan 

  

financial information with respect to ti’s business segments and operations outside the united states is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “business segment and geographic area data” on pages 35 and 36 of ti’s 2005 annual report to stockholders it is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

  

the company began operations in 1930 and is incorporated in delaware 

  

semiconductor segment 

  

semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside of modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine different transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our semiconductor segment designs manufactures and sells integrated circuits 

  

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing methods typically new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to highvolume production over time chip prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing methods and product life cycles mature 

  

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strong demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus products caused by declining demand andor excess manufacturing capacity this cycle is affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

  

we were the world’s third largest semiconductor company in 2005 as measured by revenue according to preliminary estimates from isuppli corporation an industry analyst historically our semiconductor segment averages a significantly higher growth rate than our other two business segments 

  

the majority of our semiconductor revenue comes from our core products which are analog semiconductors and digital signal processors or dsps these products enhance and often make possible a variety of applications that serve the communications computer consumer electronics automotive and industrial markets we believe that virtually all of today’s digital electronic equipment requires some form of analog or digital signal processing 

  

we also design and manufacture other types of semiconductors such as dlp ® products that enable exceptionally clear video and microprocessors that serve as the brains of highend computer servers 

  

knowledge about the systems our products go into is becoming increasingly important because it enables us to differentiate our product offerings for our customers where a customer may previously have required multiple chips for a system to operate we are now integrating the functionality of those multiple chips onto a few or even a single chip because we have both the systemlevel knowledge and the manufacturing technology to do so an example is our singlechip cell phone solution which combines the functionality of many separate chips onto one the digitization of electronics also requires more highperformance analog functionality with expertise in both digital signal processing and analog at the system level we believe we are one of a very few semiconductor companies capable of integrating both technologies onto a single chip 

  

in addition we enable our customers particularly original design manufacturers odms to take advantage of our systemlevel knowledge and thereby speed their time to market by making available to them standard chipsets and reference designs an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies those other companies then sell the products under their own brands a chipset is a group of integrated circuits based principally on our technology that are designed to work together for a specific application and are therefore packaged and sold as a unit reference designs are technical blueprints that contain all the essential elements in a system customers using our reference designs such as cellphone odms may 

  

enhance or modify the design as required our ability to deliver integrated solutions and systemlevel knowledge allows our customers to create more advanced systems and products 

  

in each of our product categories we face significant competition we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market depends upon several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line as well as technological innovation quality reliability price customer service technical support and scale 

  

following is detailed information on each product category 

  

analog 

  

analog semiconductors process “real world” inputs such as sound temperature pressure and visual images conditioning them amplifying them and converting them into digital signals they also assist in the management of power distribution and consumption aspects critical to today’s portable electronic devices 

  

the analog semiconductor market is diverse and complex and it is one of the largest sectors of the semiconductor industry we are the world’s largest supplier of analog semiconductors analog chips generated about 40 percent of our semiconductor revenue in 2005 

  

our analog product portfolio includes custom mixedsignal products that are designed to a particular customer’s or application’s specifications these products account for about 55 percent of our analog revenue the remainder of our analog revenue comes from standard products that are sold across a range of customers and applications about 40 percent of our analog revenue is from highperformance standard products and about 5 percent is from commodity standard products 

  

most of our custom and standard products are proprietary and difficult for competitors to imitate many standard analog chips tend to have long life spans 

  

approximately 15 percent of our analog revenue comes from products sold into wireless applications custom analog chips sold to cellphone original equipment manufacturers oems account for most of this revenue an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has manufactured by others a smaller portion comes from analog products included in chipsets that are sold to odms  

  

our mixedsignal products combine multiple types of analog functionality or analog and digital functions on a single chip purchasers of our custom mixedsignal products tend to be very large companies that require highvolume designs for specific applications such as communications displays printers and automotive entry into this market requires significant upfront investment as well as expertise in both analog and digital functionality a primary competitive factor in this market is manufacturing expertise and scale 

  

in the standard analog chip subcategory known as highperformance analog we have a portfolio of about 15000 products including data converters amplifiers power management devices and interface chips our highperformance analog products are used by more than 50000 customers these products are sold primarily through distributors prices in this market tend to be stable with relatively high gross profit margins the primary competitive factors are a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs and manufacturing process technologies that allow us to provide differentiated levels of performance products with higher levels of performance tend to command a premium price 

  

other standard analog chips are commodity in nature we design and manufacture thousands of lowcost highvolume standard products that are sold primarily through distributors end applications are very diverse and include portable electronic devices and communications the primary competitive factors in this market are price and availability pricing is strongly influenced by supply and demand 

  

overall in the analog market we compete globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our primary competitors include analog devices inc linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation and stmicroelectronics nv 

  

digital signal processors or dsps 

  

dsp is one of the fastestgrowing sectors of the semiconductor industry we are the world’s largest dsp supplier and dsp represents about 40 percent of our semiconductor revenue 

  

dsps use complex algorithms and compression techniques to alter and improve a data stream dsps perform these functions instantaneously and power efficiently these products are ideal for applications that require precise realtime processing of realworld analog signals that have been converted into digital form their power efficiency is important for batterypowered devices 

  

the combination of dsp with analog functionality enables a broad range of significant applications in a cell phone the process works as follows 1 the sender’s voice is picked up by an analog sensor in the cell phone’s microphone 2 an analogtodigital converter chip changes the analog sound waves of the sender’s voice into a digital code 3 the dsp compresses these digital signals and removes background noise and 4 in the listener’s cell phone the digital code is converted back into the analog sound of the sender’s voice all this happens in real time 

  

we offer programmable dsps which among other benefits enable manufacturers to differentiate their product designs via software rather than having to design new hardware 

  

our dsp portfolio includes custom applicationspecific and standard products custom products are designed for specific customers with very high volumes in established markets applicationspecific products are implementations crafted for specific applications like wireless infrastructure voip voice over internet protocol gateways digital still cameras and residential gateways to name a few our standard dsp products are sold into a broad range of applications and seed the next generation of signalprocessing innovation 

  

about 80 percent of our dsp revenue comes from the cellphone market most of this revenue is derived from custom chips that we develop with large cellphone manufacturer customers these products are typically highly integrated semiconductor devices that allow our customers to differentiate their cellphone products from their competitors’ products through performance features or cost and are sold only to a single highvolume customer additional dsp revenue from this market comes from our sales of chipsets also included in our dspbased wireless portfolio are the widely used omap ™ processors which are highperformance processors that enable multimedia applications in cell phones and other electronic devices 

  

in the dsp market we compete globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased and niche suppliers of dsps as well as suppliers of other technologies that deliver functionality that competes with dsps primary competitive factors are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise and applications support our primary competitors in the dsp market are agere systems inc analog devices inc and freescale semiconductor inc others who offer competing technologies include broadcom corp and qualcomm incorporated 

  

other semiconductor products 

  

our other semiconductor products which combined account for about 20 percent of our semiconductor revenue include the following 

  

dlp ® products 

  

our dlp technology is a digital display technology used in projectors and highdefinition televisions projectors based on this technology are used in businesses homes professional venues and digital cinemas the technology consists of microelectromechanical devices that use optical semiconductors to digitally manipulate light at the center of every dlp product is an array of up to 22 million microscopic mirrors that switch back and forth very quickly to create a high resolution highly reliable full color image this technology is used by 75 of the world’s top projector and television manufacturers since early 1996 when dlp products were first marketed ti has shipped almost 9 million dlp systems to customers all over the world 

  

our dlp ® technology competes against other display technologies such as liquid crystal display lcd plasma and cathoderay tube crt the primary competitive elements in this market include picture quality product form factors versatility and price 

  

reduced instructionset computing or risc microprocessors 

  

a microprocessor is the central processing unit of a computer system risc microprocessors are designed to provide very fast computing typically for a specialized application such as servers our risc operation is primarily the manufacture of 64bit microprocessors designed by sun microsystems inc for use in sun servers 

  

microcontrollers 

  

a microcontroller is a microprocessor designed to control a very specific task for electronic equipment key applications for our microcontrollers include automotive industrial motors and controls meters and consumer products primary competitive factors in this market include integration of control peripherals for reduced board space and number of components an integrated development environment for fast system development and a broad range of microcontroller solutions for upgradeability and flexibility in system design 

  

standard logic 

  

standard logic devices are chips generally used to manage the interchange and manipulation of signals within a system a substantial number of our standard logic products are considered commodities for which price and delivery are the key competitive factors we sell thousands of standard logic products primarily to distributors and oems end applications include consumer products and communications 

  

royalties 

  

an additional source of revenue for ti is royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies 

  

applications for our semiconductor products 

  

the table below lists the major end markets that use our semiconductor products and the approximate percentage of our semiconductor revenue that the market represents the chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets 

  

   

manufacturing 

  

we have semiconductor manufacturing sites in north america japan asia and europe these facilities include highvolume wafer fabrication plants and assemblytest sites our semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once they are in operation because we own most of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline when 

  

customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop and this can hurt our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output which should benefit profit margins 

  

the semiconductor manufacturing process begins with a thin silicon wafer on which an array of semiconductor devices is fabricated the wafer is then tested cut into chips and assembled into packages that are then individually retested 

  

our advanced digital products require the most advanced and most capitalintensive manufacturing processes dsps and other digital products tend to move to more advanced production techniques every couple of years consequently maintaining an industry leadership position requires significant capital expenditures for new manufacturing capabilities 

  

our manufacturing strategy for advanced digital processes is to build internal capacity to a level we believe will remain fully utilized over the equipment’s asset lifetime we then outsource remaining capacity from outside suppliers including semiconductor foundries and assemblytest subcontractors we also outsource the manufacturing of some products when it would be less costefficient to make those products inhouse for instance relatively lowvolume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized this internalexternal strategy is designed to reduce the level of our required capital expenditures and thereby reduce our subsequent levels of depreciation the expected end result is less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand currently outside foundries provide about 20 percent of our total wafers produced 

  

as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we utilize less space per transistor which enables us to either 1 fit more transistors on an equivalentsize chip 2 decrease the chip’s size or 3 integrate new features onto the chip by shrinking the size of transistors we also can provide faster chips that consume less power and cost less per unit to manufacture 

  

our manufacturing capabilities are on par with the best in the semiconductor industry as of december 31 2005 we have shipped more than 150 million chips manufactured using 90nanometer process technology and our 65nanometer process is now qualified and ramping into production our advanced semiconductor research and development rd is now done sidebyside with production of 300millimeter mm wafers in our dallas dmos 6 fabrication plant a second 300mm facility is under construction to help meet customer demand for advanced chips 300mm wafers greatly expand the number of equivalent chips we can put on a single wafer compared with the previous 200mm wafers 

  

in 2005 a majority of our advanced digital products were built using 130nanometer manufacturing process technology while devices using 90nanometer technology continued to increase throughout the year we also began selling processors manufactured using 65nanometer process technology one nanometer is one billionth of a meter 

  

since analog manufacturing technology evolves more slowly than digital manufacturing technology analog products typically do not require us to build new manufacturing facilities this tends to improve the profit margin on analog products since the equipment on which they are manufactured are frequently fully depreciated 

  

design centers 

  

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service design the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

  

customers 

  

our semiconductor products are sold to oems odms contract manufacturers and distributors our largest single customer in 2005 was an oem the nokia group of companies direct sales to nokia were slightly less than 10 percent of our revenue in both 2004 and 2005 although if indirect sales such as to contract manufacturers are included nokia accounted for more than 10 percent of our 2004 and 2005 revenue overall our sales to nokia as a percent of revenue were slightly higher in 2005 than in 2004 

  

sales and distribution 

  

we market and sell our products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales offices in over 25 countries worldwide distributors located around the world account for about 25 percent of our semiconductor revenue and they sell our products directly to a wide range of customers these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products they also sell products from our competitors 

  

sensors  controls segment 

  

sensors  controls designs and manufactures sensors electrical and electronic controls and radio frequency identification rfid systems we have sensors  controls manufacturing operations in the americas europe and asia and we also source some products from thirdparty manufacturers sensors  controls represented 9 percent of our revenue in 2005 

  

our sensors business is the market leader in pressure sensing for the heatingventilationair conditioning automotive and industrial markets our products improve operating performance for example by making a car’s heating and airconditioning systems work more efficiently our pressure sensors for fuel injection and vehicle stability improve safety and performance and help the environment by reducing vehicle emissions and improving gas mileage

competition 

  

our principal competitors in this business are us and japanbased companies the principal competitive factors are an understanding of the education market technology expertise and price 

  

sales and distribution 

  

eps sells its products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

  

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

  

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business portfolio we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration technologies and markets strategic to us 

  

in the first quarter of 2005 we sold to oki electric industry co ltd the assets associated with our commodity lcd driver product line in 2004 those assets generated about 200 million in revenue 

  

in 2005 we announced the acquisition of chipcon group asa a leading company in the design of shortrange lowpower wireless radiofrequency rf transceiver devices chipcon’s product line complements our existing highperformance 

  

analog power management and ultralowpower microcontroller portfolio we agreed to pay approximately 200 million for chipcon and the transaction was completed in january 2006 

  

in early 2006 we entered into an agreement to sell to an affiliate of bain capital llc for 3 billion substantially all of our sensors  controls segment we expect to complete this sale in the first half of 2006 the rfid operations which are not included in the sale will become part of our semiconductor segment the sale will allow us to intensify our focus on our highgrowth core digital signal processing and analog semiconductor opportunities 

  

backlog 

  

our backlog of orders was 211 billion at december 31 2005 and 158 billion at december 31 2004 a substantial number of orders are shipped during the quarter in which they are received we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customer requested delivery date within a maximum length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly we believe that our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period 

  

raw materials 

  

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

  

intellectual property 

  

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio we also have several agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future in general our license agreements have multiyear terms and may be renewed after renegotiation 

  

our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to semiconductor revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

  

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies 

  

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include dlp ® and omap tm  

  

research and development rd 

  

our primary area of rd investment is semiconductor products and semiconductor manufacturing technology we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of external industry consortia and universities 

  

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute to revenue until at least a few years following completion 

  

our rd expense was 202 billion in 2005 compared with 198 billion in 2004 and 175 billion in 2003 included is a charge for the value of acquisitionrelated inprocess rd of zero in 2005 and 2004 and 23 million in 2003 

  

seasonality 

  

our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation eps experiences its strongest results in the second and third quarters due to the backtoschool season the semiconductor segment generally has a weak first quarter particularly in product areas such as wireless and consumer electronics that have stronger sales later in the year as manufacturers prepare for the holiday selling season

 item 1a risk factors tableend   

you should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community and other factors beyond our control 

  

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

  

our semiconductor business is our largest business segment and the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in demand these changes could adversely affect our results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities in particular our strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for analog integrated circuits or digital signal processors decreases or if these markets or key endequipment markets such as communications entertainment electronics and computing grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

  

our margins may vary over time 

  

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own most of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or our utilization of our manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

  

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

  

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

  

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

  

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect that the level of this competition will increase in the future from large established semiconductor and related product companies as well as from emerging companies serving niche markets that we also serve certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against those of our products that currently offer technological andor price advantages over competitive products competition results in price and product development pressures which may result in reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match price declines or technological product applications support software or manufacturing advances of our competitors 

  

our performance depends in part upon our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop and license new intellectual property 

  

access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others we may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others to the extent that we rely on licenses from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain all of the licenses we desire in the future on terms we consider reasonable or at all the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected technology 

  

we benefit from royalty revenue generated from various license agreements some agreements expired in 2005 and either have been or are currently being renegotiated others will come up for renegotiation in future years future royalty revenue depends on the strength of our portfolio and enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally the consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue royalty revenue from licensees is not always uniform or predictable in part due to the performance of our licensees and in part due to the timing of new license agreements or the expiration and renewal of existing agreements 

  

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

  

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries within these industries a large portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors to customers in the cellphone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our global manufacturing design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

  

we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and in 2005 more than 80 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as the general political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations also as discussed in more detail on pages 59 and 60 of our 2005 annual report to stockholders we use forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we our customers or suppliers operate 

  

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural 

  

disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or our customers’ or suppliers’ may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in the given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture product based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our performance depends on the availability and cost of raw materials utilities critical manufacturing equipment and thirdparty manufacturing services 

  

our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials and utilities be available limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we depend on a limited number of third parties to perform these functions we do not have longterm contracts with all of these third parties reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand 

  

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxation 

  

we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the appropriate jurisdiction to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability will change 

  

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

  

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer we do maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

  

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

italian government auditors have substantially completed a review conducted in the ordinary course of approximately 250 million of grants from the italian government to ti’s former memory operations in italy the auditors have raised a number of issues relating to compliance with grant requirements and the eligibility of specific expenses for the grants as of december 31 2005 the auditors have issued audit reports on 12 of 13 projects the ministry of industry is responsible for reviewing the auditors’ findings depending on the ministry’s decision the review may result in a demand from the italian government that we repay a portion of the grants we believe that the grants were obtained and used in compliance with applicable law and contractual obligations as of december 31 2005 the ministry has published final decrees on 12 of the projects representing approximately 175 million of the grants we do not expect the outcome to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

we are involved in various proceedings conducted by the federal environmental protection agency and certain other governmental environmental agencies regarding cleanup of contaminated sites these proceedings are being coordinated with the agencies and in certain cases with other potentially responsible parties although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ we believe that the amount of our liability will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

the internal revenue code was recently amended to require that companies disclose in their form 10k whether they have been required to pay penalties to the internal revenue service for certain transactions that have been identified by the irs as abusive or that have a significant tax avoidance purpose we have not been required to pay any such penalties

company overview 

  

texas instruments incorporated is headquartered in dallas texas and has manufacturing design or sales operations in more than 25 countries we have three separate business segments 1 semiconductor which accounted for about 85 percent of our revenue in 2004 2 sensors  controls which accounted for about 10 percent of our revenue and 3 educational  productivity solutions which accounted for about 5 percent of our revenue 

  

the financial information with respect to ti’s business segments and operations outside the united states which is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “business segment and geographic area data” on pages 33 through 34 of ti’s 2004 annual report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

  

our largest geographic sources of revenue in order are asia excluding japan europe the united states and japan the company began operations in 1930 and is incorporated in delaware 

  

semiconductor segment 

  

semiconductors are the electronic building blocks used to create modern electronic systems and equipment semiconductors come in two basic forms individual transistors and integrated circuits generally known as “chips” that combine different transistors on a single piece of material to form a complete electronic circuit our semiconductor segment designs manufactures and sells integrated circuits 

  

the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advances in product designs and manufacturing methods typically new chips are produced in limited quantities at first and then ramp to highvolume production over time chip prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing methods and product life cycles mature 

  

the “semiconductor cycle” is an important concept that refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand the semiconductor market is characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strong demand andor insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by periods of surplus products caused by declining demand andor excess manufacturing capacity this cycle is affected by the significant time and capital required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities 

  

we were the world’s thirdlargest semiconductor company in 2004 in terms of revenue according to gartner inc an industry analyst historically our semiconductor segment averages a significantly higher growth rate than our other two business segments 

  

about 75 percent of semiconductor revenue comes from our core products which are analog semiconductors and digital signal processors or dsps these products enhance and often make possible a variety of applications that serve the communications computer consumer automotive and industrial markets we believe that virtually all of today’s digital electronic equipment requires some form of analog or digital signal processing 

  

we also design and manufacture other types of semiconductors such as digital light processing ™ devices that enable exceptionally clear video and microprocessors that serve as the brains of highend computer servers 

  

knowledge about the systems our products go into is becoming increasingly important because it enables us to differentiate our product offerings for our customers where a customer may previously have required multiple chips for a system to operate we are using our systemlevel knowledge to allow us to integrate the functionality of those multiple chips onto a few or even a single chip a recent example is our singlechip cell phone which combines the functionality of many separate chips onto a single chip the digitization of electronics also requires more highperformance analog functionality with expertise in both digital signal processing and analog at the system level we believe we are one of a very few semiconductor companies capable of integrating both technologies onto a single chip 

  

in addition we enable our customers particularly original design manufacturers odms to take advantage of our systemlevel knowledge and thereby speed their time to market by making available to them standard chipsets and reference designs an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies to sell under their brands a chipset is a group of integrated circuits based principally on our technology that are designed to work together for a specific application and are therefore packaged and sold as a unit reference designs are technical blueprints that contain all the essential elements in a system customers using our reference designs such as cellphone odms may enhance or modify the design as required our ability to deliver integrated solutions and systemlevel knowledge allows our customers to create more advanced systems and products 

  

in each of our product categories we face significant competition we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market depends upon several factors including the breadth of a company’s product line as well as technological innovation quality reliability price customer service technical support and scale 

  

following is detailed information on each product category 

  

analog 

  

analog semiconductors process “real world” inputs such as sound temperature pressure and visual images conditioning them amplifying them and converting them into digital signals they also assist in the management of power distribution and consumption aspects critical to today’s portable electronic devices 

  

the analog semiconductor market is diverse and complex and it is the largest sector of the semiconductor industry we are one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog semiconductors analog chips generated about 40 percent of our semiconductor revenue in 2004 

  

our analog product portfolio includes custom mixedsignal products that are designed to a particular customer’s or application’s specifications these products account for about 60 percent of our analog revenue the remainder of our analog revenue comes from standard products that are sold across a range of customers and applications about 35 percent of our analog revenue is from highperformance standard products and about 5 percent is from commodity standard products 

  

most of our custom and standard products are proprietary and difficult for competitors to imitate many standard analog chips tend to have long life spans 

  

approximately 15 percent of our analog revenue comes from products sold into wireless applications custom analog chips sold to cellphone oems account for most of this revenue an oem original equipment manufacturer designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has contracted to other manufacturers a smaller portion comes from analog products included in chipsets that are sold to odms  

  

our mixedsignal products combine multiple types of analog functionality or analog and digital functions on a single chip purchasers of our custom mixedsignal products tend to be very large companies that require highvolume designs for specific applications such as communications displays printers and automotive entry into this market requires significant upfront investment as well as expertise in both analog and digital functionality a primary competitive factor in this market is manufacturing expertise and scale 

  

in the standard analog chip subcategory known as highperformance analog we have a portfolio of more than 15000 products including data converters amplifiers power management devices and interface chips our highperformance analog products are used by more than 30000 customers these products are sold primarily through distributors prices in this market tend to be stable with relatively high gross profit margins the primary competitive factors are a diverse product portfolio to meet wideranging customer needs and manufacturing process technologies that allow us to provide differentiated levels of performance products with higher levels of performance tend to command a premium price 

  

other standard analog chips are commodity in nature we design and manufacture thousands of lowcost highvolume standard products that are sold primarily through distributors end applications are very diverse and include portable electronic devices and communications the primary competitive factors in this market are price and availability pricing is strongly influenced by supply and demand 

  

overall in the analog market we compete globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased suppliers and niche suppliers our primary competitors are analog devices inc fairchild semiconductor international inc linear technology corporation maxim integrated products inc national semiconductor corporation on semiconductor corporation philips semiconductors incorporated and stmicroelectronics nv 

  

digital signal processors or dsps 

  

dsp is one of the fastestgrowing sectors of the semiconductor industry we are the world’s largest dsp supplier and dsp represents about 35 percent of our semiconductor revenue 

  

dsps use complex algorithms and compression techniques to alter and improve a data stream dsps perform these functions instantaneously and power efficiently these products are ideal for applications that require precise realtime processing of realworld analog signals that have been converted into digital form their power efficiency is important for batterypowered devices 

  

the combination of dsp with analog functionality enables a broad range of significant applications in a cell phone the process works as follows 1 the sender’s voice is picked up by an analog sensor in the cell phone’s 

  

microphone 2 an analogtodigital converter chip changes the analog sound waves of the sender’s voice into a digital code 3 the dsp compresses these digital signals and removes background noise and 4 in the listener’s cell phone the digital code is converted back into the analog sound of the sender’s voice all this happens in real time 

  

we offer programmable dsps which among other benefits reduce risk for manufacturers because they can differentiate their product designs via software rather than having to design new hardware 

  

our dsp portfolio includes custom and standard products custom products are designed for specific customers and specific applications that include cell phones broadband modems and certain consumer electronics devices such as digital still cameras 

  

our standard dsp products are sold into a broad range of applications such as industrial control medical instrumentation communications infrastructure and consumer electronics 

  

about 75 percent of our dsp revenue comes from the cellphone market most of this revenue is derived from custom chips that we develop with large cellphone manufacturer customers these products are typically highly integrated semiconductor devices that allow our customers to differentiate their cell phone products from their competitors’ products through performance features or cost and are sold only to a single highvolume customer additional dsp revenue from this market comes from our sales of chipsets also included in our dspbased wireless portfolio are the widely used omap ™ processors which are highperformance processors that enable multimedia applications in cell phones and other electronic devices 

  

in the dsp market we compete globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased and niche suppliers of dsps as well as suppliers of other technologies that deliver functionality that competes with dsps primary competitive factors are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systemlevel knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise and applications support our primary competitors in the dsp market are agere systems inc analog devices inc and freescale semiconductor inc others who offer competing technology include broadcom corp and qualcomm incorporated 

  

other semiconductor products 

  

our other semiconductor products which combined account for about 25 percent of our semiconductor revenue include the following 

  

digital light processing or dlp ™ products 

  

dlp technology is an alldigital display technology used in projectors and highdefinition televisions dlp products are microelectromechanical systems that use optical semiconductors to digitally manipulate light at the center of every dlp projection system is a digital micromirror device that projects clear bright and sharp images we supply dlpbased chipsets to more than 65 customers who then design manufacture and market end equipment such as business and home front projectors highdefinition digital televisions and digital cinema projectors 

  

our dlp technology competes against technologies such as lcd liquid crystal display crt cathoderay tube and plasma displays made by a variety of 

  

manufacturers primary competitive factors in this market include picture quality product form factors versatility and price 

  

reduced instructionset computing or risc microprocessors 

  

a microprocessor is the central processing unit of a computer system risc microprocessors are designed to provide very fast computing typically for a specialized application such as servers our risc operation is primarily the manufacture of 64bit microprocessors designed by sun microsystems inc for use in sun servers 

  

microcontrollers 

  

a microcontroller is a microprocessor designed to control a very specific task for electronic equipment key applications for our microcontrollers include automotive industrial motors and controls meters and consumer products primary competitive factors in this market include integration of control peripherals for reduced board space and number of components an integrated development environment for fast system development and a broad range of microcontroller solutions for upgradeability and flexibility in system design 

  

logic 

  

logic devices are chips generally used to manage the interchange and manipulation of signals within a system our logic products are considered commodities and as a result the primary competitive factor in this area is price we sell thousands of logic products primarily to distributors and oems end applications include consumer products and communications 

  

royalties 

  

an additional source of revenue for ti is royalties received for our patented technology that we license to other electronics companies 

  

applications for our semiconductor products 

  

the table below lists the major end markets that use our semiconductor products and the approximate percentage of our semiconductor revenue that the market represents the chart also lists the most frequent applications and our products used within these key markets 

  

   

   

manufacturing 

  

we have manufacturing sites in the americas japan asia and europe these facilities include highvolume wafer fabs and assemblytest sites our semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once they are in operation because we own most of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline when customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop and this can hurt our profit margins conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output which should benefit profit margins 

  

the semiconductor manufacturing process includes wafer fabrication testing the wafer cutting the wafer into individual chips assembling individual chips into packages and then testing the packaged chip 

  

our advanced digital products require the most advanced and most capitalintensive manufacturing processes dsps and other digital products tend to move to more advanced logic production techniques every couple of years consequently maintaining an industry leadership position requires significant capital expenditures for new manufacturing capabilities 

  

our manufacturing strategy for advanced digital processes is to build internal capacity to the level of what we believe is sustainable market 

  

demand we then outsource extra capacity as needed from outside suppliers including semiconductor foundries and assemblytest subcontractors we also outsource the manufacturing of some products when it would be less costefficient to make those products inhouse for instance relatively lowvolume products that are unlikely to keep internal equipment fully utilized this internalexternal strategy is designed to reduce the level of our required capital expenditures and thereby reduce our subsequent levels of depreciation the expected end result is less fluctuation in our profit margins due to changing product demand currently outside foundries provide about 20 percent of our total capacity needs 

  

as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we utilize less space per transistor which enables us to either 1 fit more transistors on an equivalentsize chip 2 decrease the chip’s size or 3 integrate new features onto the chip by shrinking the size of transistors we also can provide faster chips that consume less power and cost less per unit to manufacture 

  

our manufacturing capabilities are on par with the best in the semiconductor industry in 2003 we were one of a few semiconductor companies in the world to adopt 300millimeter mm wafers this greatly expands the number of equivalent chips we can put on a single wafer compared with the previous 200mm wafers 

  

in 2004 a majority of our advanced digital products were built using 130nanometer manufacturing process technology we also began selling processors manufactured using 90nanometer process technology one nanometer is one billionth of a meter 

  

since analog manufacturing technology evolves more slowly than digital manufacturing technology analog products typically do not require us to build new manufacturing facilities this tends to improve the profit margin on analog products since the plants in which they are manufactured are frequently fully depreciated 

  

design centers 

  

our design centers provide design engineering and product application support as well as aftersales customer service design the design centers are strategically located around the world to take advantage of key technical and engineering talent and proximity to key customers 

  

customers 

  

our semiconductor products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors as we noted earlier an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies to sell under their brands an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has contracted to other manufacturers our largest single customer in 2004 was an oem the nokia group of companies in 2003 nokia accounted for 14 percent of our revenue direct sales to nokia were slightly less than 10 percent of our revenue in 2004 although if indirect sales such as to contract manufacturers are included nokia accounted for more than 10 percent of our 2004 revenue 

  

sales and distribution 

  

we market and sell our products through a direct sales force distributors and authorized thirdparty sales representatives we have sales offices in over 25 countries worldwide distributors located around the world account for about 25 percent of our semiconductor revenue and they sell our products directly to a wide range of customers these distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products they also sell products from our competitors 

  

sensors  controls segment 

  

our sensors  controls segment designs and manufactures sensors electrical and electronic controls and radio frequency identification rfid systems we have sensors  controls manufacturing operations in the americas europe and asia and we also source some products from thirdparty manufacturers sensors  controls represented about 10 percent of our revenue in 2004 

  

our sensors business is the market leader in pressure sensing for the heatingventilationair conditioning automotive and industrial markets our products improve operating performance for example by making a car’s heating and airconditioning systems work more efficiently our pressure sensors for fuel injection and vehicle stability improve safety and performance and help the environment by reducing vehicle emissions and improving gas mileage 

  

our controls business includes controls motor protectors circuit breakers arcfault circuit protectors and thermostats these products help prevent damage from overheating and fires in a wide variety of applications including aircraft commercial heating and airconditioning systems refrigerators cars lighting and industrial applications 

  

rfid technology uses wireless radio communications to uniquely identify objects or people rfid technology creates an automatic way to collect information about a product place time or transaction quickly easily and without human error it provides a wireless data link that functions even when there is no line of sight in addition rfid can be used as a data carrier with information being written and updated to the rfid tag in real time 

  

rfid technology is used in a broad range of applications including access control to buildings payatthepump gasoline sales vehicle security document tracking livestock tracking and identification product authentication retail sports timing supply chain ticketing and wireless payment our rfid systems consist of a transponder receiver and other components such as antennas 

  

competition 

  

sensors  controls is typically the top supplier in its targeted product areas though we do have strong multinational and regional competitors the primary competitive factors in this business are product reliability manufacturing costs and engineering expertise 

  

sales and distribution 

  

sensors  controls products are sold to oems and distributors 

  

educational  productivity solutions eps segment 

  

educational  productivity solutions is a leading supplier of graphing handheld calculators this business segment also provides its customers with business and scientific calculators and a wide range of advanced classroom tools and professional development resources to help students and teachers interactively explore math and science eps relies on thirdparty manufacturers to build its products this segment contributed about 5 percent of our 2004 revenue 

  

competition 

  

our principal competitors in this business are us and japanbased companies the principal competitive factors are an understanding of the education market technology expertise and price 

  

sales and distribution 

  

eps sells its products primarily through retailers and instructional dealers 

  

acquisitions divestitures and investments 

  

from time to time we consider acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen our business portfolio we had no large acquisitions or divestitures in 2004 we also make investments directly or indirectly in private companies investments are focused primarily on nextgeneration applications of digital signal processors and other technologies and markets strategic to us 

  

backlog 

  

the dollar amount of backlog of orders was 1576 million at december 31 2004 and 1708 million at december 31 2003 a substantial number of orders are shipped during the quarter in which they are received we define backlog as of a particular date as firm purchase orders with a customer requested delivery date within a maximum length of time as customer requirements and industry conditions change orders may be under certain circumstances subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities as well as industry supply and capacity considerations accordingly we believe that our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period 

  

raw materials 

  

we purchase materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers in some cases we purchase such items from sole source suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

  

intellectual property 

  

we own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to our business we have developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually add patents 

  

to that portfolio we also have several agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipate that other license agreements may be negotiated in the future our semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to semiconductor revenue we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole our rights and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to our business 

  

we often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards our competitors may also participate in the same initiatives participation in these initiatives may require us to license our patents to other companies 

  

we own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and our corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include dlp tm and omap tm  

  

research and development rd 

  

our primary area of rd investment is semiconductor products and semiconductor manufacturing technology we conduct most of our rd internally however we also closely engage with a wide range of external industry consortia and universities 

  

from time to time we may terminate rd projects before completion or decide not to manufacture and sell a developed product we do not expect that all of our rd projects will result in products that are ultimately released for sale or that our projects will contribute to revenue until at least a few years following completion 

  

our rd expense was 1978 million in 2004 compared with 1748 million in 2003 and 1619 million in 2002 included is a charge for the value of acquisitionrelated inprocess rd of zero in 2004 23 million in 2003 and 1 million in 2002 

  

seasonality 

  

our revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation eps experiences its strongest results in the second and third quarters due to the backtoschool season the semiconductor segment generally has a seasonally weak first quarter due to product areas such as wireless and digital consumer 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2004 we had 35472 employees 

  

cautionary statements regarding future results of operations 

  

you should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these cautionary statements are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies like ti with broad international operations like other companies we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance 

  

and the performance of our customers similarly the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions differences in our results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community and other factors beyond our control 

  

cyclicality in the semiconductor market may affect our performance 

  

our semiconductor business is our largest business segment and the principal source of our revenue the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid increases and decreases in demand these changes could adversely affect our results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities in particular our strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors the results of our operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for analog integrated circuits or digital signal processors decreases or if these markets or key endequipment markets such as telecommunications and computers grow at a significantly slower pace than management expects 

  

our margins may vary over time 

  

our profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in our shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of our inventory and shifts in our product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which we operate might adversely affect pricing for our products because we own most of our manufacturing capacity a significant portion of our operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or our utilization of our manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

  

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires us to develop new technologies and products 

  

our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment we require significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product life cycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and market these new products that the products we do develop and market will be well received by customers or that we will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

  

we face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

  

we face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate we expect that the level of this competition will increase in the future from large established semiconductor and related product companies as well as from emerging companies serving niche markets that we also serve certain of our competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against those of our products that currently offer technological andor price advantages over competitive products competition results in price and product development pressures which may result in reduced profit 

  

margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match price declines or technological product applications support software or manufacturing advances of our competitors 

  

our performance depends in part upon our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to develop or license new intellectual property 

  

we benefit from royalties generated from various license agreements some agreements will come up for renegotiation in 2005 others will come up for renegotiation in future years access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio future royalty revenue depends on the strength of our portfolio and enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of our licensees additionally the consolidation of our licensees may negatively affect our royalty revenue we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected technology moreover there can be no assurance that as our business expands into new areas we will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others we may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others to the extent that we rely on licenses from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain all of the licenses we desire in the future on terms we consider reasonable or at all the lack of a necessary license could expose us to claims for damages andor injunction from third parties as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have contractually agreed to indemnify our customers against damages resulting from infringement claims 

  

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and results of operations 

  

our customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the telecommunications and computerrelated industries within these industries a large portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors to customers in the cellular phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations 

  

our global manufacturing design and sales activities subject us to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

  

we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and in 2004 more than 80 percent of our revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes us to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as the general political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which we operate which could result in an adverse effect on our business operations in such countries and our results of operations also as discussed in more detail on pages 11 1920 and 5657 of our 2004 annual report to stockholders we use forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the nonus currencies in which we 

  

transact business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our nonus business 

  

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we our customers or suppliers operate 

  

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural events such as severe weather and earthquakes that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or our customers’ or suppliers’ may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

while we generate revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

incorrect forecasts of customer demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our ability to match inventory and production mix with the product mix needed to fill current orders and orders to be delivered in the given quarter may affect our ability to meet that quarter’s revenue forecast in addition when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times we manufacture product based on forecasts of customers’ demands these forecasts are based on multiple assumptions if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operation 

  

our performance depends on the availability of raw materials critical manufacturing equipment and thirdparty manufacturing services 

  

limited or delayed access to key raw materials used in the manufacturing process or critical manufacturing equipment could adversely impact our results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations we subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our integrated circuits we depend on a limited number of third parties to perform these functions we do not have longterm contracts with all of these third parties reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand 

  

our results of operations could be affected by changes in taxation 

  

we have facilities in more than 25 countries worldwide and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate our results of operations could be affected by market opportunities or decisions we make that cause us to increase or decrease operations in one or more countries or by changes in applicable tax rates or audits by the taxing authorities in countries in which we operate in addition we are subject to laws and regulations in various locations that govern the determination of which is the 

  

appropriate jurisdiction to decide when and how much profit has been earned and is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction changes in these laws and regulations could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our results of operations we have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet changes in applicable tax laws and regulations could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets which could also affect our results of operations each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast changes our forecasted tax liability may change 

  

changes in the accounting treatment of stock options and other sharebased compensation could adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we currently account for sharebased payments to employees which include stock options using the intrinsic value method of apb no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and as such generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123revised 2004 “sharebased payments” sfas 123r sfas 123r requires companies to adopt the fairvalue methodology of valuing stock options and other sharebased compensation and recognize that valuation in the financial statements from the date of grant this change in accounting treatment of employee stock options could materially and adversely affect our results of operations as the sharebased compensation expense would be charged directly against our earnings furthermore adoption of sfas 123r will require us to make certain assumptions and judgments in the valuation of stock options that we may grant in the future a change in any of those assumptions or judgments could change the compensation expense that is charged against our earnings and consequently adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our results of operations could be affected by warranty claims product recalls or product liability 

  

we could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards in the event of a warranty claim we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer we do maintain product liability insurance but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims in addition it is possible for one of our customers to recall a product containing a ti part in such instances we may incur costs and expenses relating to the recall costs or payments we may make in connection with warranty claims or product recalls may adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

  

our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that we require

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

italian government auditors have substantially completed a review conducted in the ordinary course of approximately 250 million of grants from the italian government to ti’s former memory operations in italy the auditors have raised a number of issues relating to compliance with grant requirements and the eligibility of specific expenses for the grants as of december 31 2004 the auditors have issued audit reports on twelve of thirteen projects the ministry of industry is responsible for reviewing the auditor’s findings depending on the ministry’s decision the review may result in a demand from the italian government that we repay a portion of the grants we believe that the grants were obtained and used in compliance with applicable law and contractual obligations as of december 31 2004 the ministry has published final decrees on ten of the projects representing approximately 135 million of the grants we do not expect the outcome to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  

during 2004 the delaware chancery court ruled on claims and counterclaims filed by ti and by qualcomm incorporated the litigation was initiated by qualcomm a developer and marketer of digital wireless communications products based on code division multiple access cdma technology qualcomm sought a declaration a that ti breached the patent portfolio agreement dated december 2 2000 between ti and qualcomm by disclosing information concerning the business relationship between the parties in violation of the confidentiality provisions in the agreement and b that as a result qualcomm is entitled to terminate ti’s rights under the agreement the complaint also requested damages attorneys’ fees and costs of suit ti then filed a motion to dismiss and itself filed an action against qualcomm for breach of contract on june 3 2004 ti filed a motion for summary judgment on qualcomm’s claim that ti had materially breached the agreement on july 14 2004 the court granted ti’s motion for summary judgment the court agreed with ti’s argument that its disclosure of information regarding terms of the agreement was not a material breach of the agreement and that qualcomm was not entitled to terminate ti’s rights under the agreement also on july 14 2004 the court granted qualcomm’s motion for summary judgment on ti’s claim that qualcomm had breached the agreement qualcomm subsequently dismissed its damages claim for nonmaterial breach of the agreement but amended its counterclaim to allege that ti’s filing of its case in chancery court was a material breach entitling qualcomm to terminate the agreement on september 24 2004 the court ruled in ti’s favor that ti’s filing of its case did not breach the agreement qualcomm has appealed the chancery court’s ruling ti believes the appeal is without merit 

  

we are involved in various proceedings conducted by the federal environmental protection agency and certain other governmental environmental agencies regarding cleanup of contaminated sites these proceedings are being coordinated with the agencies and in certain cases with other potentially responsible parties prps although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ we believe that the amount of our liability will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition results of operations or liquidity

the financial information with respect to ti’s business segments and operations outside the united states which is contained in the note to the financial statements captioned “business segment and geographic area data” on pages 35 through 38 of ti’s 2003 annual report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual report 

  

semiconductor 

  

the semiconductor business comprised 85 percent of ti’s 2003 revenue ti’s core semiconductor business is the design manufacture and sale of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors dsps which are used in a broad range of electronic systems these systems include cellular telephones personal computers servers communications infrastructure equipment motor controls automotive equipment and digital imaging systems such as front projectors and highdefinition digital televisions more than 30000 customers in the commercial industrial and consumer markets purchased ti products in 2003 

  

the company’s products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems original design manufacturers odms contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells products under its own brand that it manufactures inhouse or has contracted to other manufacturers ti’s largest single customer is an oem the nokia group of companies which accounted for 14 percent of ti’s 2003 revenue an odm designs and manufactures products for other companies to sell under their brands distributors which account for about 25 percent of ti’s semiconductor revenue sell ti products directly to a wide range of customers 

  

the semiconductor market is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid technological change pricing pressures and the requirement of high rates of investment for research and development rd and for the manufacturing factories and equipment needed to produce advanced semiconductors ti faces significant competition in each of its product lines 

  

analog products analog semiconductors process continuous signals such as temperature pressure and visual images ti’s analog semiconductors consist of custom products and standard products custom products are designed for specific customers for specific applications such as wireless cell phones printers and automotive systems standard products include applicationspecific standard products designed for a specific application and usable by multiple customers and highperformance standard catalog products usable in multiple applications by multiple customers these standard products are characterized by differentiated features and specifications as well as relatively high margins and are generally sold in high volumes both custom and standard products are proprietary and difficult for competitors to imitate commodity standard products are sold in high volume into a broad range of applications and generally are differentiated by price and availability ti is one of the world’s largest suppliers of analog semiconductors 

  

the analog market is highly fragmented and ti competes globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased suppliers and companies focused on a narrow range of products primary competitive factors are the recruitment and retention of skilled analog engineers the creation of innovative designs the implementation of multiple advanced manufacturing process technologies and the provision of applications support 

  

dsp products dsp is one of the fastestgrowing sectors of the semiconductor industry dsps use complex algorithms and signalcompression techniques to provide realtime powerefficient 

  

processing of realworld analog signals that have been converted into digital form ti’s dsp business includes customdesigned and standard products for a broad range of applications including communications such as wireless and broadband computer peripherals and digital consumer electronics 

  

in dsp ti competes globally with numerous large and small companies both broadbased suppliers and companies focused on a narrow range of products primary competitive factors are the ability to design and costeffectively manufacture products systems knowledge about targeted end markets software expertise and applications support 

  

other semiconductor products ti also designs and manufactures other semiconductor products including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

in addition ti’s semiconductor patent portfolio is an ongoing contributor to semiconductor revenue 

  

semiconductor manufacturing ti owns and operates semiconductor manufacturing facilities that require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixedcost assets once in operation because ti owns most of its manufacturing capacity a significant portion of the company’s operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or the company’s utilization of its manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result conversely as product demand rises and factory utilization increases the fixed costs are spread over increased output which should benefit profit margins ti also outsources a portion of its product manufacturing to outside suppliers foundries and assemblytest subcontractors ti outsources the manufacture of some products when it would be less costefficient to make those products inhouse for example when relatively high capital expenditures for equipment would be required to manufacture relatively lowvolume products whose demand would be unlikely to keep the equipment adequately utilized ti also outsources when very high demand for its products exceeds the company’s installed manufacturing capacity the effect of these outsourcing practices is to reduce the amount of capital expenditures and subsequent depreciation required to meet customer demand as well as fluctuations in profit margins 

  

other ti businesses 

  

sensors  controls comprised about 10 percent of ti’s 2003 revenue this organization sells customdesigned sensors controls and radiofrequency identification rfid systems ti’s sensor products include pressure sensors and transducers for automotive systems such as fuel injection and vehicle stability systems and heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment ti’s control products include motor protectors circuit breakers arcfault circuit protectors and thermostats for aircraft air conditioning appliance lighting and industrial applications ti’s rfid systems consist of a transponder receiver and other components applications include automotive security logistics tracking inventory control and wireless commerce at retail outlets typically the top supplier in targeted product areas sensors  controls faces strong multinational and regional competitors the primary competitive factors in this business are product reliability manufacturing costs and engineering expertise the products of the business are sold to oems and distributors 

  

educational  productivity solutions eps comprised about 5 percent of ti’s 2003 revenue and is a leading supplier of graphing handheld calculators and other calculators an understanding of the education market technology expertise and price are primary competitive factors in this business ti’s principal competitors in this business are us and japanbased companies this business sells primarily through retailers and to schools through instructional dealers 

  

acquisitions and divestitures 

  

from time to time ti considers acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen its business portfolio in the third quarter of 2003 ti acquired radia communications inc a semiconductor company specializing in the development of radio frequency semiconductor subsystems signal processing and networking technologies for 80211 wireless local area networking multibandmultimode radios 

  

backlog 

  

the dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by ti to be firm was 1708 million at december 31 2003 and 1198 million at december 31 2002 backlog orders are under certain circumstances subject to cancellation a substantial number of orders are shipped during the same quarter in which they are received accordingly the company believes that its backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period 

  

raw materials 

  

ti purchases materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to ti’s business are generally available at present and ti believes that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

ti owns many patents and has many patent applications pending in the united states and other countries in fields relating to its business the company has developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio and continually adds patents to that portfolio ti also has several agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipates that other licenses may be negotiated in the future ti does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole the rights of ti and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to ti’s business 

  

ti owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and ti’s corporate monogram other valuable trademarks include dlp tm and omap tm  

  

research and development

employees 

  

at december 31 2003 the company had 34154 employees 

  

cautionary statements regarding future results of operations 

  

you should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of ti’s filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these cautionary statements are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of ti and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies with broad international operations such as ti like other companies ti is susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and performance of ti or its customers similarly the price of ti’s securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions differences in ti’s results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community and other factors beyond ti’s control 

  

weakening or delayed recovery in the semiconductor market may adversely affect ti’s performance 

  

ti’s semiconductor business represents its largest business segment and the principal source of its revenue the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns weakening or delayed recovery in the semiconductor market could adversely affect ti’s results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market price of its securities in particular ti’s strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors the results of ti’s operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for analog integrated circuits or digital signal processors decreases or if these markets or key endequipment markets such as telecommunications and computers grow at a significantly slower pace than expected by management 

  

ti’s margins may vary over time 

  

ti’s profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in its shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of its inventory and shifts in its product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which the company operates might adversely affect pricing for the company’s products because ti owns most of its manufacturing capacity a significant portion of the company’s operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or the company’s utilization of its manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

  

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires ti to develop new technologies and products 

  

ti’s results of operations depend in part upon its ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment ti requires significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product lifecycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that ti will successfully develop and market these new products that the products ti does develop and market will be well received by customers or that ti will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

  

ti faces substantial competition that requires ti to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

  

ti faces intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which it operates ti expects that the level of this competition will increase in the future from large established semiconductor and related product companies as well as from emerging companies serving niche markets also served by ti certain of ti’s competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against those products of ti that currently offer technological andor price advantages over competitive products competition results in price and product development pressures which may result in reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that ti is unable to match price declines or technological product applications support software or manufacturing advances of its competitors 

  

ti’s performance depends in part upon its ability to enforce its intellectual property rights and to develop or license new intellectual property 

  

ti benefits from royalties generated from various license agreements some agreements will come up for renegotiation in 2005 others will come up for renegotiation in later years access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of ti’s intellectual property portfolio future royalty revenue depends on the strength of ti’s portfolio and enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of ti’s licensees additionally the consolidation of ti’s licensees may negatively affect ti’s royalty revenue ti actively enforces and protects its intellectual property rights but there can be no assurance that ti’s efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected technology moreover there can be no assurance that as ti’s business expands into new areas ti will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others ti may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others to the extent that ti relies on licenses from others there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain all of the licenses it desires in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all 

  

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for ti’s products and results of operations 

  

ti’s customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries but ti generates a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the telecommunications and computerrelated industries within these industries a large portion of ti revenue is generated by the sale of analog integrated circuits and digital signal processors to customers in the cellular phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for ti’s products and its results of operations 

  

ti’s global manufacturing design and sales activities subject it to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

  

ti operates in more than 25 countries worldwide and in 2003 more than 80 percent of its revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes ti to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as the general political and economic conditions security risks health conditions and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which it operates which could result in an adverse effect on ti’s business operations in such countries and its results of operations also as discussed in more detail on pages 19 and 54 of ti’s 2003 annual report to stockholders ti uses forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the nonus currencies in which ti transacts business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on ti’s nonus business 

  

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of ti’s largest customers could adversely affect ti’s results of operations 

  

while ti generates revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of its top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments may adversely affect ti’s results of operations 

  

ti’s performance depends on the availability of raw materials critical manufacturing equipment and thirdparty manufacturing services 

  

limited or delayed access to key raw materials used in the manufacturing process or critical manufacturing equipment could adversely impact ti’s results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect ti’s results of operations ti subcontracts a portion of its wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of its integrated circuits ti depends on a limited number of third parties to perform these 

  

functions ti does not have longterm contracts with all of these third parties reliance on these third parties involves risks including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand 

  

ti’s continued success depends in part on its ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment

semiconductor 

  

ti is a global semiconductor company and a leading designer and supplier of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits the engines driving the digitization of electronics digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits enable a wide range of new products and features for ti’s more than 30000 customers in commercial industrial and consumer markets 

  

ti also is a world leader in the design and manufacturing of other semiconductor products those products include standard logic devices applicationspecific integrated circuits reduced instructionset computing microprocessors microcontrollers and digital imaging devices 

  

the semiconductor business comprised 83 of ti’s 2002 revenue ti’s semiconductor products are used in a diverse range of electronic systems including cellular telephones personal computers servers communications infrastructure equipment digital cameras digital audio players motor controls automobiles and digital imaging systems including projector and television systems products are sold to originalequipment manufacturers oem originaldesign manufacturers odm contract manufacturers and distributors an oem designs and sells under its own brand products that it has manufactured or contracted others to manufacture for it an odm designs and manufacturers products for others to sell under their brands ti’s semiconductor patent portfolio has been established as an ongoing contributor to semiconductor revenue in 2002 sales to distributors accounted for approximately 27 of semiconductor revenue the nokia group of companies accounted in 2002 for 12 of ti’s revenue 

  

the semiconductor market is intensely competitive subject to rapid technological change and pricing pressures and requires high rates of investment ti faces strong competition in all of its semiconductor product lines the rapid pace of change and technological breakthroughs constantly create new opportunities for existing competitors and startups which can quickly render existing technologies less valuable in digital signal processors ti competes with a number of large and small companies both usbased and international new product development capabilities applications support software knowledge and advanced semiconductor process technology are the primary competitive factors in this business 

  

the market for analog integrated circuits is highly fragmented ti competes with a number of large and small companies both usbased and international primary competitive factors in this business are the availability of innovative designs and designers a broad range of process technologies and applications support and particularly in the standard products area price 

  

  

other ti businesses 

  

in addition to semiconductors ti has two other segments the largest representing 11 of ti’s 2002 revenue is sensors  controls this business sells sensors electrical and electronic controls and radiofrequency identification systems into automotive and industrial markets typically the top supplier in targeted product areas sensors  controls faces strong multinational and regional competitors the primary competitive factors in this business are product reliability manufacturing costs and engineering expertise the products of the business are sold to oems and distributors 

  

educational  productivity solutions eps represents 6 of ti’s 2002 revenue and is a leading supplier of graphing and other educational calculators this business sells primarily through retailers and to schools through instructional dealers ti’s principal competitors in this business are us and japanbased companies technology expertise price and infrastructure for education and market understanding are primary competitive factors in this business 

  

acquisitions and divestitures 

  

from time to time ti considers acquisitions and divestitures that may strengthen its business portfolio ti may effect one or more of these transactions at such time or times as it determines to be appropriate in the second quarter of 2002 ti completed its acquisition of condat ag berlin a developer of wireless communication software and platforms for mobile business applications for a purchase price of approximately 87 million 

  

backlog 

  

the dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by ti to be firm was 1057 million as of december 31 2002 and 1036 million as of december 31 2001 backlog orders are under certain circumstances subject to cancellation a substantial number of orders are shipped during the same quarter in which they are received accordingly the company believes that its backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period 

  

raw materials 

  

ti purchases materials parts and supplies from a number of suppliers the materials parts and supplies essential to ti’s business are generally available at present and ti believes that such materials parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future 

  

patents and trademarks 

  

ti owns many patents in the united states and other countries the company has developed a strong broadbased patent portfolio ti also has several agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipates that other licenses may be negotiated in the future ti does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license although taken as a whole the rights of ti and the products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to ti’s business 

  

ti owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its business these trademarks are valuable assets the most important of which are “texas instruments” and ti’s corporate monogram 

  

research and development 

  

ti’s research and development expense was 1619 million in 2002 compared with 1598 million in 2001 and 1747 million in 2000 included is a charge for the 

  

value of acquisitionrelated purchased inprocess research and development of 1 million in 2002 zero in 2001 and 112 million in 2000 

  

seasonality 

  

ti’s revenue and operating results are subject to some seasonal variation in particular eps is subject to seasonal variation experiencing its strongest revenue and operating results in the second and third quarters as retailers stock for the backtoschool season 

  

employees

cautionary statements regarding future results of operations 

  

you should read the following cautionary statements in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of ti’s filings with the securities and exchange commission sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings these cautionary statements are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of ti and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to companies with broad international operations such as ti like other companies ti is susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and performance of ti or its customers similarly the price of ti’s securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions differences in ti’s results of operations from estimates and projections generated by the investment community and other factors beyond ti’s control 

  

further weakening or delayed recovery in the semiconductor market may adversely affect ti’s performance 

  

ti’s semiconductor business represents its largest business segment and the principal source of its revenue the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns after strong growth in 1999 and 2000 the semiconductor market declined significantly in 2001 and grew only slightly in 2002 further weakening or delayed recovery in the semiconductor market could adversely affect ti’s results of operations and have an adverse effect on the market price of its securities in particular ti’s strategic focus in this business is on the development and marketing of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits the results of ti’s operations may be adversely affected in the future if demand for digital signal processors or analog integrated circuits decreases or if these markets or key endequipment markets such as telecommunications and computers grow at a significantly slower pace than expected by management 

  

ti’s margins may vary over time 

  

ti’s profit margins may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors including decreases in its shipment volume reductions in or obsolescence of its inventory and shifts in its product mix in addition the highly competitive market environment in which the company operates might adversely affect pricing for the company’s products because ti owns most of its manufacturing capacity a significant portion of the company’s operating costs are fixed these costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or the company’s utilization of its manufacturing capacity and can adversely affect profit margins as a result 

  

  

the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change that requires ti to develop new technologies and products 

  

ti’s results of operations depend in part upon its ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment ti requires significant capital to develop new technologies and products to meet changing customer demands that in turn may result in shortened product lifecycles moreover expenditures for technology and product development are generally made before the commercial viability for such developments can be assured as a result there can be no assurance that ti will successfully develop and market these new products that the products ti does develop and market will be well received by customers or that ti will realize a return on the capital expended to develop such products 

  

ti faces substantial competition that requires ti to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures 

  

ti faces intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which it operates ti expects that the level of this competition will increase in the future from large established semiconductor and related product companies as well as from emerging companies serving niche markets also served by ti certain of ti’s competitors possess sufficient financial technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against those products of ti that currently offer technological andor price advantages over competitive products competition results in price and product development pressures which may result in reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that ti is unable to match price declines or technological product applications support software or manufacturing advances of its competitors 

  

ti’s performance depends in part upon its ability to enforce its intellectual property rights and to develop or license new intellectual property 

  

ti benefits from royalties generated from various license agreements that will generally be in effect through the year 2005 access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of ti’s intellectual property portfolio future royalty revenue depends on the strength of ti’s portfolio and enforcement efforts and on the sales and financial stability of ti’s licensees additionally the consolidation of ti’s licensees may negatively affect ti’s royalty revenue ti actively enforces and protects its intellectual property rights but there can be no assurance that ti’s efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of the protected technology moreover there can be no assurance that as ti’s business expands into new areas ti will be able to independently develop the technology software or knowhow necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others ti may have to rely increasingly on licensed technology from others to the extent that ti relies on licenses from others there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain all of the licenses it desires in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all 

  

a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for ti’s products and results of operations 

  

ti’s customer base includes companies in a wide range of industries but ti generates a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the telecommunications and computerrelated industries within these industries a large portion of ti revenue is generated by the sale of digital signal processors and analog integrated circuits to customers in the cellular phone personal computer and communications infrastructure markets decline in one or several of these enduser markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for ti’s products and its results of operations 

  

  

ti’s global manufacturing design and sales activities subject it to risks associated with legal political economic or other changes 

  

ti operates in more than 25 countries worldwide and in 2002 more than 76 of its revenue came from sales to locations outside the united states operating internationally exposes ti to changes in export controls and other laws or policies as well as the general economic conditions security risks and possible disruptions in transportation networks of the various countries in which it operates which could result in an adverse effect on ti’s business operations in such countries and its results of operations also as discussed in more detail on pages 19 and 49 of ti’s 2002 annual report to stockholders ti uses forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the adverse earnings impact from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the company’s nonus dollar net balance sheet exposures nevertheless in periods when the us dollar strengthens in relation to the nonus currencies in which ti transacts business the remeasurement of nonus dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on ti’s nonus business 

  

the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by any of ti’s largest customers could adversely affect ti’s results of operations 

  

while ti generates revenue from thousands of customers worldwide the loss of or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of its top customers including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers or the timing of customer inventory adjustments may adversely affect ti’s results of operations 

  

ti’s performance depends on the availability of raw materials and critical manufacturing equipment 

  

limited or delayed access to key raw materials used in the manufacturing process or critical manufacturing equipment could adversely impact ti’s results of operations additionally the inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect ti’s results of operations 

  

ti’s continued success depends in part on its ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment 

  

ti’s continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including technical marketing management and staff personnel experienced personnel in the electronics industry are in high demand and competition for their skills is intense there can be no assurance that ti will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key personnel that it requires 

  

fluctuations in the market values of the company’s investments and in interest rates could adversely affect ti’s results of operations 

  

ti has investments of various types and maturities most investments are equity investments in publicly traded companies the values of which are subject to market price volatility ti may recognize in earnings the decline in the value of its investments for information regarding the sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of the company’s investments and interest rates see the section titled “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” on pages 49 and 50 in ti’s 2002 annual report to stockholders furthermore ti’s equity investments in both publicly traded companies and private companies are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize
