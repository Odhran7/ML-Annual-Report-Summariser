 item 1a risk factors 

described below are certain risks we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate the risks are categorized using the following headings external strategic operational regulatory and legal and financial and market each of the following risk factors should be carefully considered in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10k and in our other public disclosures the risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial all forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below 

external risks 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has subjected our business operations and financial condition to a number of risks and those risks may intensify or last for an extended period of time future pandemics may also introduce similar risks 

risks related to sales and customer demand  at various times throughout the ongoing covid19 pandemic  the pandemic and the operational changes we have made have resulted in significant reductions in customer visits to and spending at our stores the extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess including the duration and scope of the pandemic and its resurgences  the extent of the impact on global and regional economies and economic activity including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates consumer discretionary spending and consumer confidence actions governments take including governments’ positions towards monetary andor fiscal policy including potential stimulus or the timing and nature of loosening of restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic and its resurgence interruptions and other supply chain issues actions businesses and individuals take in their ongoing responses to the pandemic and our ability to successfully navigate those impacts during the pandemic consumer spending on consumer electronics has generally been higher than prepandemic levels after the pandemic consumers might shift their spending back towards categories or industries that were affected by the pandemic and away from consumer electronic categories in addition the pandemic has caused some products and services to be in high demand and we may not be able to meet this demand in all of our categories due to product shortages or decisions by our vendors to allocate products to certain customers due to the circumstances resulting from the pandemic and our vendors may increase prices each of which may adversely impact our revenue and profitability the pandemic has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our products and services that historically have been more likely to be purchased in a physical store than online 

risks related to operations  the pandemic forced us to make a number of operational changes although we continue to offer a contactless curbside model for those who prefer to shop that way we could be required to return to a curbsideonly model or close stores due to the current or future resurgence of the pandemic including the potential emergence of new and more transmissible variants such as the delta and omicron variants our ability to continue to sell our products and services is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety of our customers and those employees who are needed to work at our stores and distribution facilities failure to maintain the recommended or required safety standards as defined by the cdc  federal and state occupational safety and health agencies and local governments could also result in an increased risk of regulatory action or civil litigation the ability of our employees to work may continue to be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 and its resurgences and by the availability and efficacy of vaccinations particularly against new variants of covid19  while we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our customers and employees these measures may not be successful and we may be required to temporarily close distribution centers or stores from time to time halt certain services or take other measures also if our customers and employees do not perceive our response to be appropriate or adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our business in the future additionally while we have continued to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and customers as we continue to operate during the pandemic we may face an increased risk of litigation related to our operating environments the pandemic may also cause increased cybersecurity risk as cybercriminals attempt to capitalize from the disruption including remote working arrangements preparing for and responding to the continuing pandemic could divert management’s attention from our key strategic priorities increase costs as we prioritize health and safety matters for our employees and customers cause us to reduce delay alter or abandon initiatives that may otherwise increase our longterm value or otherwise disrupt our business operations 

risks related to profitability  to the extent the pandemic continues to cause fundamental shifts in the channels in which customers choose to engage us our profitability may be adversely impacted facility c osts such as rent depreciation and property taxes are largely fixed regardless of whether we are able to keep our stores open and our online mix of products and services generally produces lower gross profit rates than instore sales  we also tend to see lower online revenue for certain service offerings that have higher profitability rates to the extent we are not able to maintain or increase the level of customer traffic in our stores or maintain or enable a more profitable mix of sales in our digital and online channels our profitability may be materially negatively impacted we have also incurred costs due to the operational changes we have made in response to the pandemic and these costs have adversely impacted our profitability as a result of disruptions to our supply chain primarily due to mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured and domestic labor shortages impacting the ports our distribution centers and our product delivery services  we are experiencing and may continue to experience increased costs for shipping and transportation resources if we are unable to manage these costs and supply chain disruptions our profitability may be adversely impacted even after the pandemic subsides we could experience a longerterm impact on our costs for example the need for enhanced health and hygiene and testing requirements to counteract the risk of future outbreaks in the event of continued decreased store traffic certain of our stores may not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses which could adversely affect the value of our owned and leased properties potentially requiring us to record more significant noncash impairment charges in future periods 

risks related to our debt and global financing markets  we may find it necessary to increase our cash position and our debt in the future in response to further resurgences of covid19 in the event we are required to raise capital our access to and cost of financing will depend on among other things global economic conditions conditions in the global financing markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing our prospects our credit ratings and our business and industry outlook there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or will be available on terms consistent with our expectations 

covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of covid19 could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we have identified in this section which in turn could materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price further covid19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations  

macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate including but not limited to the effects of covid19 may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results 

to varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending as a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example 

• whether or not they make a purchase 

• their choice of brand model or pricepoint 

• how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices and 

• their appetite for complementary services for example protection plans 

real gdp growth consumer confidence the covid19 pandemic inflation including wage inflation employment levels including as a result of an increasingly tight job market oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer in addition to general levels of inflation we are also subject to risks of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due to for example high consumer demand component shortages and supply chain disruption we may be unable to increase our prices sufficiently to offset these pressures 

geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results for example the ultimate impact of the conflict in ukraine on fuel prices inflation the global supply chain and other macroeconomic conditions is unknown and could materially adversely affect global economic growth consumer confidence and demand for our products and services russia is a significant global producer of both fuel and raw materials used in certain of the products we sell including nickel aluminum and copper disruptions in the markets for those inputs or other inputs produced by russia whether due to sanctions market pressure not to purchase inputs from russia or otherwise could increase overall material costs for many of the products we sell we cannot predict the extent or duration of sanctions in response to the conflict in ukraine nor can we predict the effects of legislative or other governmental actions or regulatory scrutiny of russia its allies or other countries with which russia has significant trade or financial ties including china the conflict in ukraine may also exacerbate geopolitical tensions globally similarly further deterioration of relations between taiwan and china the resulting actions taken the response of the international community and other factors affecting trade with china or political or economic conditions in taiwan could disrupt the manufacturing of products or hardware components in the region such as semiconductors and television panels sourced from taiwan or the broader array of products sourced from china one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain the cost of our products or our revenues and financial results 

catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results 

the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance such events may consist of or be caused by for example 

• natural disasters or extreme weather events including those related to climate change 

• diseases or pandemics including covid19 that have affected and may continue to affect our employees customers or partners 

• floods fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties employees or customers or 

• terrorism civil unrest mass violence or violent acts or other conflicts 

in recent years we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets such events can adversely affect our workforce and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties they can also disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain distribution network and thirdparty business operations that may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for business operations at the quantities and levels we require finally such events can also affect our information technology systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders 

three of our largest states by total sales are california texas and florida areas where natural disasters and extreme weather conditions have been and could continue to be more prevalent natural disasters and climaterelated events in those states and other areas where our sales and operations are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of our stores distribution centers or other facilities 

further external social activism tension and violence resulting from external events impacting social justice and inequality and our response to them may adversely affect our employees customers properties and the communities in which we operate also if our customers and employees do not perceive our response to be appropriate or adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our business in the future as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences 

we operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption this manifests itself in a variety of ways the emergence of new products and categories the often rapid maturation of categories cannibalization of categories changing price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles 

this rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time if we fail to interpret predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include failure to offer the products and services that our customers want excess inventory which may require heavy discounting or liquidation inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply delays in adapting our merchandising marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends and damage to our brand and reputation in addition consumer preferences may be influenced even further as the social and economic environment navigates through the covid19 pandemic these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

strategic risks 

we face strong competition from multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers vendors and mobile network carriers which directly affects our revenue and profitability 

while we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value the retail sector is highly competitive price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology the ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us 

the retail sector has experienced an immense increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications as well as online sales for both instore or curbside pickup online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowcost or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency could put pressure on our margins as these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability 

if we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our operations and profitability may be harmed in addition changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability 

our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores service centers distribution centers field and corporate offices our strategy of offering highquality services and assistance for our customers requires a highlytrained and engaged workforce the turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and has increased during the pandemic and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include for example employee engagement our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities in addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations 

we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employerprovided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability we may also be subject to continued market pressure to increase employee hourly wage rates and increased cost pressure on employerprovided benefits our need to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material adverse impact to the profitability of our business 

our strategy to expand into new products services  health and technologies brings new business financial and regulatory risks 

as we introduce new products and services using new technologies and applications we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions these offerings may present new and difficult technology and regulatory challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions failures or other issues 

this expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management employees operations systems technical expertise financial resources and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions in addition new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results they may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise 

the healthcare space in which we operate is highly regulated from a product safety and quality perspective and its services and products including parts or materials from suppliers are subject to regulation by various government and regulatory agencies including the us food and drug administration “fda” in the european union a medical device regulation was published in 2017 that will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements on some of our offerings 

with our focus on healthcare new products and services may frequently require regulatory approvals for market introduction the number and diversity of regulatory bodies add complexity and may negatively impact time to market and implementation costs noncompliance with conditions imposed by regulatory authorities could result in product recalls a temporary ban on products stoppages at production facilities remediation costs fines or claims for damages product safety incidents or user concerns could trigger business reviews by the fda or other regulatory agencies which if failed could trigger these impacts 

in addition the ongoing digitalization of best buy health’s products and services including our holding of personal health data and medical data increases the importance of compliance with data privacy and similar laws the services and systems used in certain instances subject us to privacy and information security requirements such as the health insurance portability and accountability act and could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks as well as business or system interruption risks given our acquisition of current health ltd a careathome technology platform we also are subject to the uk general data protection regulation “gdpr” and other newly applicable regulatory frameworks these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and reputation  

our focus on services exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

we offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings including consultation delivery design installation memberships protection plans repair setup technical support and health safety and caregiving monitoring and support designing marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

• pressure on services attachment as a result of the sustained increase in consumer desire to purchase product offerings online and through mobile applications 

• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises 

• increased pressure on margins as we roll out our totaltech membership offering which includes incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous total tech support offer and the risk that increased volumes will not fully compensate for lower margins or for loss of revenue and profit from revenue streams that are now included as benefits  

• pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs 

• use of thirdparty services that do not meet our standards or comply with applicable labor and independent contractor regulations leading to potential reputational damage and liability risk 

• increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services 

• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses 

• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes which may increase our scope of liability 

• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings 

• employees having access to customer devices including the information held on those devices which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the privacy of the data they hold 

• the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake 

• the risk that inhome services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather health and safety concerns and catastrophic events and 

• increased risk of noncompliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services 

our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors in fiscal 2022 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79  of the merchandise we purchased with five suppliers – apple samsung hp lg and sony  representing approximately 56  of total merchandise purchased we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties while we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brands with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues andor when there is less competition for those products in addition vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms 

we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry for example if carriers change the structure of contracts upgrade terms qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenue and profitability in addition our carriers may also serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels 

demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focus on consumer experience 

we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation we believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success operational factors such as failure to deliver high quality services uncompetitive pricing failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation external factors such as negative public remarks or accusations could also be damaging the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in among other things declines in revenues and customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business 

we may decide to enter into new joint ventures partnerships alliances or acquisitions with third parties collectively “new ventures” assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors including for example 

• different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments 

• failure to attract motivate and retain key employees of the new venture 

• uncertainty of forecasting financial performance 

• failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems 

• failure to maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting 

• failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions 

• unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture 

• disputes or strategic differences with key employees or other thirdparty participants in the new venture and 

• adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture 

if new ventures are unsuccessful our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired new ventures may also divert our financial resources and management’s attention from other important areas of our business 

failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 

effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omnichannel strategy failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability most of our properties are leased under multiyear contracts as such it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our longterm real estate strategy such factors include for example 

• changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior particularly in light of an evolving omnichannel environment 

• our ability to adjust store operating models to adapt to these changing patterns as we have done with our curbside pickup and shipfromstore models 

• the location and appropriate number of stores supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio 

• the interior layout format and size of our stores 

• the products and services we offer at each store 

• the local competitive positioning trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores 

• the primary term lease commitment and longterm lease option coverage for each store and 

• the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents 

if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example 

• closing stores and abandoning the related assets while retaining the financial commitments of the leases 

• incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores 

• operating stores supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business and 

• bearing excessive lease expenses 

these consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity 

for leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant in addition to rent we are typically still responsible for taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant 

operational risks 

interruptions and other factors affecting our stores and supply chain including inbound deliveries from our vendors may adversely affect our business 

our stores and supply chain assets are a critical part of our operations particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online we depend on our vendors’ abilities to deliver products to us at the right location at the right time and in the right quantities we also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network the factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include but are not limited to 

• interruptions to our delivery capabilities 

• failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments 

• disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems 

• limitations in capacity 

• global supplychain impacts that could hinder our vendors’ ability to meet our demand for product volumes and timing 

• increased levels of inventory loss due to organized crime theft or damage 

• risk to our employees and customers arising from burglary or robbery from our stores or other facilities 

• consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors 

• labor strikes slowdowns or labor shortages including as a result of an increasingly competitive job market affecting our stores or impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain 

• diseases pandemics including covid19 outbreaks and other healthrelated concerns 

• increasing transportation costs and 

• the covid19 pandemic and disruptions as a result of efforts to control or mitigate the pandemic such as facility closures governmental orders outbreaks andor transportation capacity 

it is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands any disruption to or inefficiency in our supply chain network whether due to geopolitical conflicts covid19 or other factors could damage our revenue and profitability the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business the continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks if we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability 

we utilize thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our operations and any material disruption in our relationship or their services may have an adverse impact on our business 

we engage key thirdparty business partners to support various functions of our business including but not limited to delivery and installation customer warranty information technology web hosting and cloudbased services customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards gift cards technical support transportation insurance programs and human resource operations any material disruption in our relationships with key thirdparty business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods 

our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results 

sales of our exclusive brands products which include best buy essentials dynex insignia modal platinum and rocketfish branded products as well as products such as jitterbug and lively branded products represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

• we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brands product defects and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions 

• we may be subject to regulatory compliance andor product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage caused by exclusive brands products some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls 

• we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to covid19 and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns our inability to develop longterm relationships with key manufacturers other diseases or pandemics unforeseen natural disasters or geopolitical crises such as the conflict in ukraine and this conflict’s potential impact on global geopolitical tensions including with china or between china and taiwan 

• we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards whether for new exclusive brands products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer 

• we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have returntovendor rights 

• we are subject to developing and oftenchanging labor and environmental laws for the manufacturing of products in foreign countries and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner 

• we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brands products 

‎ 

• our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply 

• we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brands products or manufacturing processes and 

• regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and depending on the findings of our countryoforigin inquiry could have an adverse effect on our reputation 

maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brands products and the profits we are able to generate from them 

we are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the us 

our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us risks such as political or economic instability crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs merchandise quality issues product safety concerns work stoppages port delays foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics including covid19 and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities and may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors we rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing services fulfillment staff planning and deployment financial management reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information 

our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks and other malicious actions including the recent increasing use of “ransomware” and phishing attacks catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees while we have adopted and continue to enhance business continuity and disaster recovery plans and strategies there is no guarantee that such plans and strategies will be effective which could interrupt the functionality of our information technology systems or those of third parties the failure or interruption of these information systems data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation 

as we continue to migrate more systems to the cloud we may face additional risks that may compromise our security or disrupt our business capabilities including ensuring the proper configuration the unknowns of operating more workloads in the cloud securing systems in the cloud and the types of cloudbased services we leverage 

we face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities 

we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications if we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware software network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems it could cause system interruptions and delays disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels malicious attacks by governments criminals or other nonstate actors other technical difficulties or events outside of our control such as natural disasters power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services which could cause us to forgo material revenues and incur material costs and could adversely affect our reputation 

further as our online sales have increased and have become critical to our growth and as we have shifted to remote working arrangements for many employees the risk of any interruption of our information technology system capabilities is heightened as well as the risk that customer demand exceeds the capacity of our online operations any such interruption or capacity constraint could result in a deterioration of our ability to process online sales provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions 

failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer employee vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage as well as litigation and enforcement actions 

our business involves the collection use and storage of personal information including payment card information and protected health information  as well as confidential information regarding our employees vendors and other company information we also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties as well as use thirdparty technology and systems which process and transmit information for a variety of activities we have been the target of attempted cyberattacks and other security threats and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems while we engage in significant dataprotection efforts criminal activity such as cyberattacks lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our privacy and security measures and as a result unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner or otherwise seek to extract financial gain based on access to or possession of company employee or customer information furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and claims 

sensitive customer data may also be present on customerowned devices entrusted to us for service and repair vulnerable code on products sold or serviced including our exclusive brands may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture sell and service may not be effective resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships 

increasing costs associated with information security and privacy such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff costs of compliance costs resulting from fraud or criminal activity and costs of cyber and privacy insurance could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially additionally new laws such as the california privacy rights act  virginia consumer data protection act and the colorado privacy act and laws newly applicable to us such as the uk gdpr are expanding our obligations to protect and honor the privacy and security of customer data requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach in addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk 

product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

if the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety and quality we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation recalls of products particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model 

as an employer of approximately 105000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including for example 

• the organization of unions and related rules that affect the nature of labor relations changes to which the national labor relations board frequently considers 

• laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and the classification of employees and independent contractors and 

• laws that impact minimum wage sick time paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs andor impact the level of service we are able to provide 

changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation our ability to continue operations and our profitability 

regulatory and legal risks 

we are subject to statutory regulatory and legal developments that could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include but are not limited to 

• the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local national or international jurisdictions 

• the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy carbon emissions electronics recycling and water or product materials 

• the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport 

• the financial operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security 

‎ 

• the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including but not limited to financial reform national labor relations board rule changes healthcare reform contracted worker labor laws corporate governance matters including increased focus on environmental social and governance matters by certain investors and regulators escheatment rules rules governing pricing content distribution copyright mobile communications electronic device certification or payment services andor other future legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure 

• the impact of litigation including classaction lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders and labor and employment matters and 

• the impact of changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development or changes in laws regulations and policies such as economic fiscal tax retail labor and social policies 

the impact of geopolitical tensions including the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the us or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect on our business in particular future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china could lead to the imposition of tariffs or other trade actions that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects 

further the impact of potential changes in us state or other countries’ tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance additionally defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert management’s attention and resources from other matters 

concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment which could result in future tax compliance transportation and utility cost increases our own climate changeoriented initiatives such as our attempts to increase energy efficiency during store construction and remodeling could also increase our costs in addition changes to the environment both longterm and shortterm may affect consumer shopping behavior in a way that negatively impacts our revenue revenue mix and profitability 

further as the covid19 pandemic and its resurgences persist we will continue to face risk and uncertainty as it relates to federal state and local government public health orders or mandates which may restrict how we do business and potentially impact our performance and profitability 

our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above as well as to risks associated with the legislative judicial regulatory political economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

we operate retail locations in canada all of our former stores in mexico were closed as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 in addition most of our exclusive brands products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia we also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries including bermuda china hong kong luxembourg the republic of mauritius and the uk during fiscal 2022 our international segment’s operations generated approximately 8  of our revenue in general the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations in addition our international operations also expose us to other risks including those related to for example 

• political conditions and geopolitical events including war and terrorism 

• economic conditions including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules as well as foreign exchange rate risk 

• rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities 

• governmentimposed travel restrictions or warnings whether in response to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events 

• cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately 

• different rules or practices regarding employee relations including the existence of works councils or unions 

• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and 

• difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations 

these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs 

financial and market risks 

failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

as discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues however some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors’ because of for example our extended retail footprint and structure our hourly pay structure our differentiated service offerings or our levels of customer service accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives 

we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of competitive promotional activity new product release activity and customer buying patterns which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly unexpected events or developments such as resurgences of the covid19 pandemic natural or manmade disasters changes in consumer demand economic factors product sourcing issues cyberattacks failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations as a result of these factors there is risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected 

economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs 

we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low or nointerest financing on qualifying purchases we believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases approximately 25  of our fiscal 2022 revenue was transacted using one of the company’s branded cards in addition we earn profitshare income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs the income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors including the volume and value of transactions the terms of promotional financing offers bad debt rates interest rates the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs 

constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 

we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders these factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 

any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 

failure to meet any financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we may provide to the public could result in a decline in our stock price 

we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forwardlooking information for future periods when we provide guidance we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of management’s expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders but such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide if our financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce any guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline

overview 

we are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life  we accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs whether they come to us online visit our stores or invite us into their homes we have operations in the us and canada 

we have two reportable segments domestic and international the domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states districts and territories of the us and our best buy health business and includes the brand names best buy best buy ads best buy business best buy health cst current health geek squad lively magnolia pacific kitchen and home and yardbird and the domain names bestbuycom currenthealthcom livelycom and yardbirdcom all of our former stores in mexico were closed as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and our international segment is now comprised of all operations in canada under the brand names best buy best buy mobile and geek squad and the domain name bestbuyca 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 included 52 weeks our business like that of many retailers is seasonal a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

comparable sales 

throughout this mda we refer to comparable sales comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable priorperiod of equivalent length comparable sales includes revenue from stores websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and represents sales initiated on a website or app regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store curbside at an alternative pickup location or take delivery direct to their homes revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition comparable sales also includes credit card revenue gift card breakage commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as applicable revenue from stores closed more than 14 days including but not limited to relocated remodeled expanded and downsized stores or stores impacted by natural disasters is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our international segment only all periods presented apply this methodology consistently 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease “covid19” as a pandemic all stores that were temporarily closed as a result of covid19 or operating a curbsideonly operating model are included in comparable sales 

on november 24 2020 we announced our decision to exit our operations in mexico as a result all revenue from mexico operations has been excluded from our comparable sales calculation beginning in december of fiscal 2021 

on may 9 2019 we acquired all outstanding shares of critical signal technologies inc “cst” on november 2 2021 we acquired all outstanding shares of current health ltd “current health” on november 4 2021 we acquired all outstanding shares of two peaks llc dba yardbird furniture “yardbird”  consistent with our comparable sales policy the results of cst were included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 and the results of current health and yardbird are excluded from our comparable sales calculation until the first quarter of fiscal 2024 

we believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods 

nongaap financial measures 

this mda includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us “gaap” as well as certain adjusted or nongaap financial measures such as constant currency nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap diluted earnings per share “eps” we believe that nongaap financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance for these reasons our internal management reporting also includes nongaap financial measures generally our nongaap financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges goodwill and intangible impairments pricefixing settlements gains and losses on certain investments intangible asset amortization certain acquisitionrelated costs and the tax effect of all such items in addition certain other items may be excluded from nongaap financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors these nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not superior to or as a substitute for gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nongaap financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment’s operating results from local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes we also may use the term “constant currency” which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates we believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates 

refer to the nongaap financial measures section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap diluted eps in the presented periods 

business strategy update 

in fiscal 2022 we delivered record revenue and earnings our leaders continued to drive new ways of operating and our employees continued to support our customers’ technology needs in knowledgeable fast and convenient ways in the face of unprecedented challenges and change 

as we entered the year we anchored on three concepts we believed to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that were and are shaping our strategic priorities and investments 

1 customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead not follow 

2 our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while we provide more flexible opportunities for our employees 

3 technology is a need and is playing an even more crucial role in peoples’ lives and as a result our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important 

with these concepts in mind we piloted numerous store formats to test and learn in the past year we advanced our flexible workforce initiative and invested in our employees’ wellbeing and we introduced new technology tools designed to support both our customers and our employees 

we also launched a bold new membership program called best buy totaltech designed to significantly elevate our customer experience and drive incremental sales totaltech leverages our strengths across merchandising fulfillment installation tech support and product repair and is designed to give our customers the confidence that whatever their technology needs are we will be there to help members receive product discounts and priority access to certain indemand products free delivery and standard installation free technical support up to 24 months of product protection on most purchases with active membership and other benefits while this new offering introduces pressure to our nearterm profitability we believe totaltech is a membership experience that customers will love and in turn will generate a higher customer lifetime value and drive a larger share of consumer electronics spending to best buy 

all of this was advanced against a constantly evolving backdrop during the year we navigated supply chain and transportation challenges uncertainty as covid19 peaks rolled across the country and then most recently the disruption from the covid19 omicron wave our teams have expertly managed supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic to bring in products our customers needed 

during the year we continued serving our customers digitally at much higher rates than before the pandemic our online revenue was 34 of our domestic revenue compared to 43 last year and 19 two years ago and while online revenue declined compared to last year it was up 115 or 88 billion compared to two years ago 

at the same time we reached our fastest package delivery speeds the percent of online orders we delivered in one day was twice as high as prepandemic levels despite the significant increase in volume during that same timeframe 

these strong results were driven by the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in our supply chain store operations our people and technology more importantly these results are driven by our employees across the company over the past 24 months they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic created safe environments for our customers and worked tirelessly to provide excellent service in fact despite all the changes throughout the year we delivered customer satisfaction improvements both online and in our stores 

as we look to the future we view technology as a permanent and growing need in the home and we expect technology to constantly evolve as the worlds largest technology companies continue to innovate we are investing now to ensure we pivot to meet the needs of our customers helping enrich their lives through technology in ways we believe no one else can and retaining our unique position in our industry 

results of operations 

consolidated results 

selected consolidated financial data was as follows  in millions except per share amounts

in fiscal 2022 we generated 518 billion in revenue and our comparable sales increased 104 we continued to experience elevated demand for technology products and services throughout most of the year as consumers continued to leverage technology to meet their needs and we provided solutions that help them work learn entertain cook and connect at home our performance resulted in an operating income rate increase of 08 compared to fiscal 2021 

revenue sga and operating income rate changes in fiscal 2022 were primarily driven by our domestic segment the gross profit rate change in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by our international segment for further discussion of each segment’s rate changes see segment performance summary  below 

segment performance summary 

domestic segment 

selected financial data for the domestic segment was as follows  in millions 



1 comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation 

the increase in revenue in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by the comparable sales growth across most of our product categories partially offset by the loss of revenue from permanent store closures in the past year online revenue of 164 billion decreased 120 on a comparable basis in fiscal 2022 primarily due to channel shifts in customer shopping behavior as a result of the evolution of the covid19 pandemic 

domestic segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years were as follows 



1 excludes stores that were temporarily closed as a result of covid19 

we continuously monitor store performance as part of a marketdriven omnichannel strategy as we approach the expiration of leases we evaluate various options for each location including whether a store should remain open we currently expect to close approximately 20 to 30 best buy stores annually through fiscal 2025 consistent with prioryear trends we also expect to increase the number of outlet centers to approximately 30 by the end of fiscal 2023 

domestic segment revenue mix percentages and comparable sales percentage changes by revenue category were as follows 



notable comparable sales changes by revenue category were as follows 

• computing and mobile phones the 51 comparable sales growth was driven primarily by computing mobile phones and wearables partially offset by a comparable sales decline in networking

• appliances the 241 comparable sales growth was driven primarily by large appliances 

• entertainment the 74 comparable sales growth was driven primarily by virtual reality 

• services the 59 comparable sales growth was driven primarily by membership offerings 

our gross profit rate decreased in fiscal 2022 primarily driven by lower services margin rates which included pressure associated with our totaltech membership offering that includes incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous total tech support offer the decrease was partially offset by higher profitsharing revenue from our private label and cobranded credit card arrangement and improved product margins 

our sga increased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher shortterm incentive compensation technology investments advertising expenses and store payroll expenses which included 81 million of employee retention credits in the prioryear period as a result of the federal coronavirus aid relief and economic security act this was partially offset by the impact of a 40 million donation to the best buy foundation in the prior year 

the restructuring credit in fiscal 2022 was primarily related to subsequent adjustments to termination benefits resulting from changes in our previously planned organizational changes and higherthanexpected retention rates refer to note 3 restructuring  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our operating income rate increased in fiscal 2022 primarily driven by increased leverage from higher sales volume on our fixed expenses which resulted in a favorable sga rate and lower restructuring charges partially offset by the unfavorable gross profit rate described above 

international segment 

selected financial data for the international segment was as follows  in millions 



the decrease in revenue in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by lower revenue in mexico as a result of our decision in fiscal 2021 to exit operations partially offset by favorable foreign currency exchange fluctuations and comparable sales growth across most of our product categories in canada

• other the 88 comparable sales growth was driven primarily by sporting goods 

our gross profit rate increased in fiscal 2022 primarily driven by improved product margin rates in canada and sales mixing out of mexico which had a lower gross profit rate than canada the increases were also driven by higher inventory markdowns in the prior year associated with our decision to exit operations in mexico 

our sga in fiscal 2022 was flat compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates and increased store payroll and incentive compensation expenses in canada offset by lower expenses in mexico as a result of our decision to exit operations there 

the restructuring charges in fiscal 2022 related to our decision to exit operations in mexico refer to note 3 restructuring  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our operating income rate increased in fiscal 2022 primarily driven by lower restructuring charges and the increase in gross profit rate described above 

additional consolidated results 

  

income tax expense 

  

income tax expense decreased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to multijurisdiction multiyear noncash benefits from the resolution of certain discrete tax matters partially offset by the impact of increased pretax earnings our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to these noncash benefits from the resolution of certain discrete tax matters as well as a decrease in losses for which tax benefits were not recognized 

nongaap financial measures 

reconciliations of operating income effective tax rate and diluted eps gaap financial measures to nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap diluted eps nongaap financial measures respectively were as follows  in millions except per share amounts 



for additional information regarding the nature of charges discussed below refer to note 2 acquisitions  note 3 restructuring  note 4 goodwill and intangible assets  and note 11 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

1 represents inventory markdowns recorded within cost of sales associated with the decision to exit operations in mexico 

2 represents a pricefixing litigation settlement received in relation to products purchased and sold in prior fiscal years 

3 represents charges associated with acquisitions including 1 the noncash amortization of definitelived intangible assets including customer relationships tradenames and developed technology and 2 acquisitionrelated transaction and due diligence costs primarily comprised of professional fees 

4 represents charges in fiscal 2021 and subsequent adjustments in fiscal 2022 related to actions taken in the domestic segment to better align the company’s organizational structure with its strategic focus and the decision to exit operations in mexico in the international segment and charges and subsequent adjustments associated with us retail operating model changes in fiscal 2020 

5 represents an increase in the fair value of a minority equity investment in fiscal 2021 

6 the nongaap adjustments primarily relate to the us and mexico as such the income tax charge is generally calculated using the statutory tax rate of 245 for us nongaap items for all periods presented there is no income tax charge for mexico nongaap items and a minimal amount of us nongaap items as there was no tax benefit recognized on these expenses in the calculation of gaap income tax expense 

our nongaap operating income rate increased in fiscal 2022 primarily driven by an increase in gross profit rate and increased leverage from higher sales volume on our fixed expenses which resulted in a favorable sga rate 

our nongaap effective tax rate decreased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to multijurisdiction multiyear noncash benefits from the resolution of certain discrete tax matters 

our nongaap diluted eps increased in fiscal 2022 primarily driven by the increase in nongaap operating income lower diluted weightedaverage common shares outstanding from share repurchases and a lower effective tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements depend on key variables including the level of investment required to support our business strategies the performance of our business capital expenditures dividends credit facilities shortterm borrowing arrangements and working capital management we modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise for example at the onset of the covid19 pandemic in fiscal 2021 we adopted several measures to preserve cash such as reducing capital expenditures suspending share repurchases and temporarily drawing down on our revolving credit facility we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy 

cash and cash equivalents were as follows  in millions 



the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to share repurchases investments in capital expenditures dividends paid and the acquisitions of current health and yardbird these decreases were partially offset by positive cash flows from operations primarily driven by earnings 

cash flows 

cash flows were as follows  in millions 



operating activities 

in fiscal 2021 cash provided by operating activities was higher than historical averages primarily due to higher inventory turnover and the timing of inventory purchases and payments to meet continued higher demand the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to the timing and volume of inventory purchases and payments reflecting an earlier build of inventory and greater inventory availability in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 which resulted in a higher proportion of inventory purchases having been paid for compared to fiscal 2021 this decrease was partially offset by higher earnings in fiscal 2022 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to the acquisitions of current health and yardbird  

financing activities 

the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher share repurchases 

sources of liquidity 

funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures share repurchases dividends and strategic initiatives including business combinations however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to limit our spending there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing if necessary on favorable terms 

on may 18 2021 we entered into a 125 billion five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility agreement the “fiveyear facility agreement” with a syndicate of banks the fiveyear facility agreement replaced the previous 125 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “previous facility” with a syndicate of banks which was originally scheduled to expire in april 2023 but was terminated on may 18 2021 the fiveyear facility agreement permits borrowings of up to 125 billion and expires in may 2026 there were no borrowings outstanding under the fiveyear facility agreement as of january 29 2022 or under the previous facility as of january 30 2021 

our ability to continue to access the fiveyear facility agreement is subject to our compliance with its terms and conditions including financial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios as of january 29 2022 we were in compliance with all financial covenants if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt it would likely constitute an event of default under the fiveyear facility agreement as well 

our credit ratings and outlook as of march 16 2022 are summarized below on may 20 2021 standard  poor’s upgraded its rating to bbb and confirmed its outlook of stable moody’s rating and outlook remained unchanged from those disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended january 30 2021 



credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy if changes in our credit ratings were to occur they could impact among other things interest costs for certain of our credit facilities our future borrowing costs access to capital markets vendor financing terms and future newstore leasing costs 

restricted cash 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are primarily restricted to use to cover selfinsurance liabilities and product protection plans provided under our totaltech membership offering restricted cash which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets was 269 million and 131 million as of january 29 2022 and january 30 2021 respectively the increase in restricted cash was primarily due to the initial funding related to the national launch of our totaltech membership offering in october 2021 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were as follows  in millions 



1 storerelated projects are primarily comprised of store remodels and various merchandising projects 

2 total capital expenditures exclude noncash capital expenditures of 46 million 32 million and 10 million in fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively noncash capital expenditures are comprised of additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable as well as finance leases 

we currently expect to increase our annual capital expenditures to at least 1 billion over the next three fiscal years as we continue to invest in our stores and information technology to further our strategy 

debt and capital 

as of january 29 2022 we had 500 million of principal amount of notes due october 1 2028 “2028 notes” and 650 million of principal amount of notes due october 1 2030 “2030 notes” refer to note 8 debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our outstanding debt 

share repurchases and dividends 

we repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our board the payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions our longterm capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investmentgrade credit metrics 

on february 16 2021 our board approved a 50 billion share repurchase program on february 28 2022 our board approved a new 50 billion share repurchase program replacing the thenexisting program which had 16 billion remaining available for repurchases as of january 29 2022 there is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under this authorization on march 3 2022 we announced our plans to spend approximately 15 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2023 

share repurchase and dividend activity were as follows  and shares in millions except per share amounts 



the total cost of shares repurchased increased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to our announced plan to repurchase more than 25 billion shares in fiscal 2022 following the temporary suspension of all share repurchases from march to november of fiscal 2021 to preserve liquidity in light of covid19related uncertainties between the end of fiscal 2022 on january 29 2022 and march 16 2022 we repurchased an incremental 24 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 239 million 

cash dividends declared and paid increased in fiscal 2022 primarily due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend per share on march 3 2022  we announced the board’s approval of a 26 increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 088 per share 

other financial measures 

our current ratio calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities decreased to 10 as of january 29 2022 compared to 12 as of january 30 2021 primarily due to the decrease in cash and cash equivalents our debt to earnings ratio calculated as total debt including current portion divided by net earnings decreased to 05 as of january 29 2022 compared to 08 as of january 30 2021 primarily due to higher earnings 

offbalancesheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not have outstanding offbalancesheet arrangements contractual obligations as of january 29 2022 were as follows  in millions 



for additional information regarding the nature of contractual obligations discussed below refer to note 6 derivative instruments  note 7 leases  note 8 debt  and note 13 contingencies and commitments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

1 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable are legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty additionally although they do not contain legally binding purchase commitments we included open purchase orders in the table above substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days 

2 lease obligations exclude 51 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced  

3 operating lease obligations exclude payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance these charges if included would increase total operating lease obligations by 06 billion as of january 29 2022 

4 represents principal amounts only and excludes interest rate swap valuation adjustments related to our longterm debt obligations 

5 interest payments related to our 2028 notes and 2030 notes include the variable interest rate payments included in our interest rate swaps 

additionally we have 125 billion in undrawn capacity on our fiveyear facility agreement as of january 29 2022 which if drawn upon would be included in either shortterm or longterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k other than our adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201602 leases  in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results these estimates require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty 

vendor allowances 

description 

we receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements primarily in the form of purchasesbased or salesbased volumes and for product advertising and placement  we recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendors products are recorded as an offset to the related expense within sga when incurred 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory these estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors including 1 proper classification of the type of funding received and 2 the methodology to estimate the portion of purchasesbased funding that should be recognized in cost of sales in each period which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sellthrough of inventory 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our vendor funding deferral as of january 29 2022 would have affected net earnings by approximately 35 million in fiscal 2022 the overall level of vendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years 

goodwill 

description 

goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an armslength transaction 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

determining fair value of a reporting unit is complex and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and market information such as trading multiples and other observable metrics cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors such as revenue growth rates expenses and capital expenditures market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables we have goodwill in two reporting units – best buy domestic and best buy health – with carrying values of 491 million and 893 million respectively as of january 29 2022 there is greater uncertainty surrounding the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the best buy health reporting unit and therefore a greater degree of complexity and judgment involved in our impairment analysis our valuation of best buy health incorporates relatively higher levels of revenue growth than our valuation of best buy domestic and incorporates estimates such as new customer growth customer retention rates capital expenditure requirements advertising and costtoserve expenses and weightedaverage cost of capital rates all of which incorporate significant judgment 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in the fair value of the best buy health reporting unit as of january 29 2022 would not have triggered an impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2022 the fair value of our best buy health reporting unit has remained substantially in excess of its carrying value over the last three fiscal years 

inventory markdown 

description 

our merchandise inventories were 60 billion as of january 29 2022 we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis no adjustment is recorded for inventory that we are able to return to our vendors for full credit 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected revenue and incremental costs we will generate for current inventory such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates as well as factors such as product type and condition forecasted consumer demand product lifecycles promotional environment vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition we also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value such as vendor allowances and selling costs 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our markdown adjustment as of january 29 2022 would have affected net earnings by approximately 12 million in fiscal 2022 the level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years 

tax contingencies 

description 

our income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we may record a liability for such exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors such as changes in tax law interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution see note 11 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

service revenue 

description 

we sell membership plans that include access to benefits such as technical support price discounts on certain products and services product protection plans and antivirus software we allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value for performance obligations provided over the term of the contract we typically recognize revenue on a usage basis an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term this method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns primarily derived from historical information 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

there is judgment in 1 measuring the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations and 2 assessing the appropriate recognition and methodology for each performance obligation and for those based on usage estimating the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of customers when insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until such history has accumulated 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of january 29 2022 would have affected net earnings by approximately 26 million in fiscal 2022 while our underlying assumptions have remained relatively consistent the amount of services membership deferred revenue has increased over the last three fiscal years primarily due to growth in our membership program offerings 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a description of new applicable accounting pronouncements see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in shortterm market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash generate interest income that will vary based on changes in shortterm interest rates in addition we have swapped a portion of our fixedrate debt to floatingrate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with shortterm interest rates refer to note 6 derivative instruments  and note 8 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our interest rate swaps 

as of january 29 2022 we had 32 billion of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and 500 million of debt that has been swapped to floating rate and therefore the net balance exposed to interest rate changes was 27 billion as of january 29 2022 a 50basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 14 million reduction in net interest expense and conversely a 50basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 14 million increase in net interest expense 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to operations in our international segment on a limited basis we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our canadian operations our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows as well as net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments refer to note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these instruments 

in fiscal 2022 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily driven by the strength of the canadian dollar compared to the us dollar compared to the prioryear period which had a positive overall impact on our revenue as this foreign currency revenue translated into more us dollars we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net favorable impact on our revenue of approximately 217 million the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our net earnings in fiscal 2022 was not significant

risks related to sales and customer demand  at various times during fiscal 2021 the pandemic and the operational changes we have made have resulted in significant reductions in customer visits to and spending at our stores the extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess including the duration of the pandemic the extent of the impact on global and regional economies and economic activity including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates consumer discretionary spending and consumer confidence actions governments take including governments’ positions towards monetary andor fiscal policy including potential stimulus or the timing and nature of loosening of restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic and its resurgence actions businesses and individuals take in their ongoing responses to the pandemic and our ability to successfully navigate those impacts covid19 has caused consumers to allocate a higher share of wallet to consumer electronics after the pandemic consumers might shift their spending back towards categories or industries that were affected by the pandemic and away from consumer electronic categories in addition the pandemic has caused some products and services to be in high demand and we may not be able to meet this demand in all of our categories due to product shortages or decisions by our vendors to allocate products to certain customers due to the circumstances resulting from the pandemic and our vendors may increase prices each of which may adversely impact our revenue and profitability the pandemic has and may continue to negatively impact our products and services that historically have been more likely to be purchased in a physical store than online 

risks related to operations  the pandemic has forced us to make a number of operational changes although we continue to offer a contactless curbside model for those who prefer to shop that way we could be required to return to a curbsideonly model or close stores due to the current or future resurgence of the pandemic our ability to continue to sell our products and services is highly dependent on our ability to maintain the safety of our customers and those employees who are needed to work at our stores and distribution facilities failure to maintain the recommended or required safety standards as defined by the centers for disease control and prevention and local governments could also result in an increased risk of regulatory action or civil litigation the ability of our employees to work may be significantly impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to covid19 while we are following the requirements of governmental authorities and taking preventative and protective measures to prioritize the safety of our customers and employees these measures may not be successful and we may be required to temporarily close distribution centers or stores from time to time halt certain services or take other measures also if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our business in the future additionally while we have continued to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and customers as we continue to operate during the pandemic we face an increased risk of litigation related to our operating environments preparing for and responding to the continuing pandemic could divert management’s attention from our key strategic priorities increase costs as we prioritize health and safety matters for our employees and customers cause us to reduce delay alter or abandon initiatives that may otherwise increase our longterm value or otherwise disrupt our business operations 

risks related to profitability  to the extent covid19 continues to cause fundamental shifts in the channels in which customers choose to engage us our profitability and our profitability rate may be adversely impacted for example at various times in fiscal 2021 we continued to pay rent for a number of physical stores that were closed and not generating sales and we may need to do so again in the future our online mix of products and services generally produces lower gross profit rates than instore sales and we offer some products and services that historically are more likely to be purchased in a physical store than online we also do not offer or have limited digital and online offerings for certain products and services that have higher profitability rates to the extent we are not able to maintain or increase the level of customer traffic in our stores or maintain or enable a more profitable mix of sales in our digital and online channels our profitability and profitability rates may be materially negatively impacted we have also incurred additional costs due to the operational changes we have made in response to the pandemic and these costs have adversely impacted our profitability as a result of disruptions to our supply chain primarily due to mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured we are experiencing and may continue to experience increased costs for shipping and transportation resources if we are unable to manage these costs and supply chain disruptions our profitability may be adversely impacted even after the covid19 pandemic subsides we could experience a longerterm impact on our costs for example the need for enhanced health and hygiene requirements in one or more regions in attempts to counteract future outbreaks in the event of decreased store traffic certain of our stores may not generate revenue sufficient to meet operating expenses which could adversely affect the value of our owned and leased properties potentially requiring us to record more significant noncash impairment charges in future periods 

risks related to our debt and global financing markets  although we repaid in full the amounts we had borrowed under our revolving credit facility during fiscal 2021 we may find it necessary to increase our cash position and our shortterm debt in the future in response to further resurgences of covid19 in the event we are required to raise capital our access to and cost of financing will depend on among other things global economic conditions conditions in the global financing markets the availability of sufficient amounts of financing our prospects our credit ratings and our business and industry outlook there is no guarantee that debt or equity financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations or will be available on terms consistent with our expectations 

covid19 and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of covid19 could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we have identified in this section which in turn could materially adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations including revenues and profitability andor stock price further covid19 may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations  

macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate including but not limited to the effects of covid19 may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results 

to varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending as a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example 

• whether or not they make a purchase 

• their choice of brand model or pricepoint 

• how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices and 

• their appetite for complementary services for example protection plans 

real gdp growth consumer confidence the covid19 pandemic inflation employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

future outbreaks epidemics andor pandemics could adversely impact our operating results 

the risk of or actual occurrence of national international or global outbreaks epidemics andor pandemics could have a material adverse impact on our business including but not limited to our sales and customer demand operations and supply chain financial results capital financing or other financing activities and all other stated risks identified in these risk factors 

catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results 

the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance such events may be caused by for example 

• natural disasters or extreme weather events 

• diseases or pandemics including covid19 that have affected and may continue to affect our employees customers or partners 

• floods fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties employees or customers or 

• terrorism civil unrest mass violence or violent acts or other conflicts 

in recent years we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network they can also affect our information technology systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders 

further external social activism tension and violence resulting from external events impacting social justice and inequality and our position and response to them may adversely affect our employees customers properties and the communities in which we operate as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences 

we operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption this manifests itself in a variety of ways the emergence of new products and categories rapid maturation of categories cannibalization of categories declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles 

this rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time if we fail to interpret predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include failure to offer the products and services that our customers want excess inventory which may require heavy discounting or liquidation inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply delays in adapting our merchandising marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends and damage to our brand and reputation in addition consumer preferences may be influenced even further as the social and economic environment navigates through the covid19 pandemic these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

strategic risks 

we face strong competition from multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers vendors and mobile network carriers which directly affects our revenue and profitability 

while we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value the retail sector is highly competitive price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology the ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us 

the retail sector has experienced an immense increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications as well as online sales for both instore or curbside pickup online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowcost or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency could put pressure on our margins as these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability 

if we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our operations and profitability may be harmed in addition changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability 

our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores service centers distribution centers field and corporate offices our strategy of offering highquality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce the turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include for example employee engagement our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities in addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations 

we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employerprovided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability our increase in the starting hourly wage for all domestic employees implemented in fiscal 2021 as well as continued market pressure to increase employee hourly wage rates increased cost pressure on employerprovided benefits our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material adverse impact to the profitability of our business 

our strategy to expand into new products services and technologies brings new business financial and regulatory risks 

as we introduce new products and services using new technologies and applications we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions failures or other issues for example as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology we are subject to privacy and information security rules such as the health insurance portability and accountability act andor subject to increased potential liability risk 

this expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management employees operations systems technical expertise financial resources and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions in addition new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results they may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise 

in fiscal 2021 we continued to invest in our health strategy and our underlying purpose to enrich lives through technology the new healthrelated services offered might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of these services in addition the services and systems used could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks as well as business or system interruption risks these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

we offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings including consultation delivery design installation memberships protection plans repair setup technical support and health safety and caregiving monitoring and support designing marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

• pressure on services attachment as a result of the sustained increase in consumer desire to purchase product offerings online and through mobile applications 

• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises 

• pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs 

• increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services 

• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses 

• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes which may increase our scope of liability 

• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings 

• employees having access to customer devices including the information held on those devices which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and the privacy of the data they hold 

• the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake 

• the risk that inhome services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather health and safety concerns and catastrophic events and 

• increased risk of noncompliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services 

our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors in fiscal 2021 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 80 of the merchandise we purchased with five suppliers  apple samsung hewlettpackard lg and sony  representing approximately 57 of total merchandise purchased we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties while we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brands with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues andor when there is less competition for those products in addition vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms 

we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry for example if carriers change the structure of contracts upgrade terms qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenue and profitability in addition our carriers may also serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels 

demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focus on consumer experience 

we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation we believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success operational factors such as failure to deliver high quality services uncompetitive pricing failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation external factors such as negative public remarks or accusations could also be damaging the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in among other things declines in revenues and customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

we are subject to risks associated with company transformation 

our transformational activities within the organization are necessary to fully support our strategic vision for future customer and income growth including our building the new blue strategy and any decreased capability to undertake those activities may have a material adverse impact on achieving that strategy 

any limitations in organizational financial or operational infrastructure could decrease our ability to realize transformational objectives supporting our key strategic initiatives relating to our development of competitive advantages creating solutions for customers and providing differentiated value if we do not have access to or fail to dedicate the appropriate people management focus and resources to implementing these transformational objectives our longterm growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

the covid19 pandemic has further demonstrated the necessity for transformation and as a result has increased pressure on the timeline of these activities the increased pressure to transform quickly and accelerate the implementation of the strategy could have an adverse impact on the overall implementation performance of these objectives and our longterm growth and profitability  as an example we have seen that our online mix of products and services generally produces lower profit margins than instore sales therefore the continued transformation to a more digitallydriven business after covid19 could put sustained pressure on our costs and profitability 

failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business 

we may decide to enter into new joint ventures partnerships alliances or acquisitions with third parties collectively new ventures assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors including for example 

• different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments 

• failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture 

• uncertainty of forecasting financial performance 

• failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems 

• failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting 

• failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions 

• unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture 

• disputes or strategic differences with other thirdparty participants in the new venture and 

• adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture 

if new ventures are unsuccessful our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired new ventures may also divert our financial resources and managements attention from other important areas of our business 

failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 

effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multichannel strategy failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability most of our properties are leased of which some are subject to longterm leases as such it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our longterm real estate strategy such factors include for example 

• changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior particularly in light of an evolving multichannel environment 

• the location and appropriate number of stores supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio 

• the interior layout format and size of our stores 

• the products and services we offer at each store 

• the local competitive positioning trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores 

• the primary term lease commitment and longterm lease option coverage for each store and 

• the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents 

if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example 

• closing stores and abandoning the related assets while retaining the financial commitments of the leases 

• incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores 

• operating stores supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business and 

• bearing excessive lease expenses 

these consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity 

for leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant in addition to rent we are typically still responsible for taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant 

operational risks 

interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain including inbound deliveries from our vendors may adversely affect our business 

our supply chain is a critical part of our operations particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online we depend on our vendors abilities to deliver products to us at the right location at the right time and in the right quantities we also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network the factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include but are not limited to 

• interruptions to our delivery capabilities 

• failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments 

• disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems 

• limitations in capacity 

• consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors 

• labor strikes or slowdowns impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain 

• diseases pandemics including covid19 outbreaks and other healthrelated concerns 

• damages or other loss to products 

• increasing transportation costs and 

• the covid19 pandemic and disruptions as a result of efforts to control or mitigate the pandemic such as facility closures governmental orders outbreaks andor transportation capacity 

it is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands any disruption to or inefficiency in our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business the continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks if we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability 

we utilize thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our operations and any material disruption in our relationship or their services may have an adverse impact on our business 

we engage key thirdparty business partners to support various functions of our business including but not limited to information technology web hosting and cloudbased services human resource operations customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards gift cards customer warranty delivery and installation technical support transportation and insurance programs any material disruption in our relationships with key thirdparty business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods 

our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results 

sales of our exclusive brands products which include best buy essentials dynex insignia modal platinum and rocketfish branded products as well as products such as jitterbug and lively branded products represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

• we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brands product defects and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions 

• we may be subject to regulatory compliance andor product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage caused by exclusive brands products some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls 

• we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to covid19 and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns our inability to develop longterm relationships with key manufacturers other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural disasters 

• we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards whether for new exclusive brands products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer 

• we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have returntovendor rights 

• we are subject to developing and oftenchanging labor and environmental laws for the manufacturing of products in foreign countries and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner 

• we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brands products 

• our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply 

• we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brands products or manufacturing processes and 

• regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and depending on the findings of our countryoforigin inquiry could have an adverse effect on our reputation 

maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brands products and the profits we are able to generate from them 

we are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the us 

our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us risks such as political or economic instability crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs merchandise quality issues product safety concerns work stoppages port delays foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics including covid19 and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities and may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors we rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing services fulfillment staff planning and deployment financial management reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information 

our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks and other malicious actions catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees the failure or interruption of these information systems data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation 

we face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities 

we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications if we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware software network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems it could cause system interruptions and delays disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels malicious attacks other technical difficulties or events outside of our control such as natural disasters power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services which could cause us to forgo material revenues incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation 

further as our online sales have increased and have become critical to our growth and as we have shifted to remote working arrangements for many employees the risk of any interruption of our information technology system capabilities is heightened as well as the risk that customer demand exceeds the capacity of our online operations any such interruption or capacity constraint could result in a deterioration of our ability to process online sales provide customer service or perform other necessary business functions 

failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer employee vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage as well as litigation and enforcement actions 

our business involves the collection use and storage of personal information including payment card information as well as confidential information regarding our employees vendors and other company information we also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties as well as use thirdparty technology and systems which transmit information for a variety of activities we have been the target of attempted cyberattacks and other security threats and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems while we engage in significant dataprotection efforts criminal activity such as cyberattacks lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our privacy and security measures and as a result unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and claims 

sensitive customer data may also be present on customerowned devices entrusted to us for service and repair vulnerable code on products sold or serviced including our exclusive brands may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture sell and service may not be effective resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships 

increasing costs associated with information security and privacy such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff costs of compliance costs resulting from fraud and costs of cyber and privacy insurance could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially additionally new laws such as the california consumer privacy act  are expanding our obligations to protect the privacy and security of customer data requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach in addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk 

product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

if the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation recalls of products particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model 

as an employer of approximately 102000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including for example 

• the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations changes to which the national labor relations board frequently considers 

• laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and 

• laws that impact minimum wage sick time paid leave and scheduling requirements that could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs andor impact the level of service we are able to provide 

changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation our ability to continue operations and our profitability 

regulatory and legal risks 

we are subject to statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include but are not limited to 

• the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local national or international jurisdictions 

• the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy carbon emissions electronics recycling and water or product materials 

• the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport 

• the financial operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security 

• the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including but not limited to financial reform national labor relations board rule changes healthcare reform contracted worker labor laws corporate governance matters escheatment rules rules governing pricing content distribution copyright mobile communications electronic device certification or payment services andor other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure 

• the impact of litigation trends including classaction lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders and labor and employment matters and 

• the impact of the transition in presidential administrations and changes in the federal executive and legislative branches on the development or changes in laws regulations and policies such as economic fiscal tax retail labor and social policies 

the impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the us or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect on our business in particular future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china could lead to the imposition of tariffs or other trade actions that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects as we did in fiscal 2020 

further the impact of potential changes in us or other countries tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws including additional guidance and legislation related to the tax cuts and jobs act and the coronavirus aid relief and economic security “cares” act could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance additionally defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters  

further as the covid19 pandemic and community spread of the virus continues to persist we will continue to face risk and uncertainty as it relates to state and local government orders which may restrict how we do business and potentially impact our performance and profitability 

our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above as well as to risks associated with the legislative judicial regulatory political economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

we operate retail locations in canada and during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we made the decision to exit our operations in mexico  in addition most of our exclusive brands products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia we also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries including barbados bermuda china hong kong luxembourg the republic of mauritius and the uk during fiscal 2021 our international segments operations generated 8 of our revenue in general the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations in addition our international operations also expose us to other risks including those related to for example 

• political conditions and geopolitical events including war and terrorism 

• economic conditions including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules as well as foreign exchange rate risk 

• rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities 

• governmentimposed travel restrictions or warnings whether in response to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events 

• cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately 

• different rules or practices regarding employee relations including the existence of works councils or unions 

• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights 

• difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations and 

• risks we may encounter in exiting our operations in mexico 

these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs 

financial and market risks 

failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

as discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues however some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors because of for example our extended retail footprint and structure our hourly pay structure our differentiated service offerings or our levels of customer service accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives 

we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of competitive promotional activity new product release activity and customer buying patterns which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters changes in consumer demand economic factors product sourcing issues cyberattacks failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations in addition during fiscal 2021 we extended the holiday shopping season starting in midoctober while closing stores on thanksgiving day these changes could bring additional unknown risks related to the sales performance of the holiday shopping season as a result of these factors there is risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected 

economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs 

we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low or nointerest financing on qualifying purchases we believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases approximately 25 of our fiscal 2021 revenue was transacted using one of the companys branded cards in addition we earn profitshare income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs the income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors including the volume and value of transactions the terms of promotional financing offers bad debt rates interest rates the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs 

in addition we may experience pressure from lower profitsharing revenue related to our private label and cobranded credit card arrangements as the economic ramifications of covid19 may lead to higher credit card defaults over time which would have an adverse effect on our profitability 

constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 

we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders these factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 

any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 

failure to meet any financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we may provide to the public could result in a decline in our stock price 

we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forwardlooking information for future periods when we provide guidance we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders but such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide if our financial results for a particular period do not meet any guidance we provide or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce any guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results unless otherwise noted transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude our mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k refer to item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 1 2020 for discussion of the results of operations for the year ended february 1 2020 compared to the year ended february 2 2019 which is incorporated by reference herein 

overview 

our purpose is to enrich lives through technology we have two reportable segments domestic and international the domestic segment is comprised of the operations including our best buy health business in all states districts and territories of the us under various brand names including best buy best buy business best buy express best buy health cst geek squad greatcall lively magnolia and pacific kitchen and home and the domain names bestbuycom and greatcallcom the international segment is comprised of all operations in canada and mexico under the brand names best buy best buy express best buy mobile and geek squad and the domain names bestbuyca and bestbuycommx during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we made the decision to exit our operations in mexico refer to note 2 restructuring  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january fiscal 2021 fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included 52 weeks our business like that of many retailers is seasonal a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico 

comparable sales 

throughout this mda we refer to comparable sales comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable priorperiod of equivalent length comparable sales includes revenue from stores websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months stores closed more than 14 days including but not limited to relocated remodeled expanded and downsized stores or stores impacted by natural disasters are excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening acquisitions are included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition comparable sales also includes credit card revenue gift card breakage commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as applicable comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our international segment only online sales are included in comparable sales online sales represent those initiated on a website or app regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store curbside at an alternative pickup location or take delivery direct to their homes all periods presented apply this methodology consistently 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease “covid19” as a pandemic all stores that were temporarily closed as a result of covid19 or operating a curbsideonly operating model are included in comparable sales 

on november 24 2020 we announced our decision to exit our operations in mexico as a result all revenue from mexico operations has been excluded from our comparable sales calculation beginning in december of fiscal 2021 

on march 1 2018 we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining best buy mobile standalone stores in the us as a result all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from our comparable sales calculation beginning in march 2018 on october 1 2018 we acquired all outstanding shares of greatcall inc “greatcall” and on may 9 2019 we acquired all outstanding shares of critical signal technologies inc “cst”  consistent with our comparable sales policy the results of greatcall are included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and the results of cst are included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 

we believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods 

nongaap financial measures 

this mda includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap as well as certain adjusted or nongaap financial measures such as constant currency nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap diluted earnings per share eps we believe that nongaap financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance for these reasons our internal management reporting also includes nongaap financial measures generally our nongaap financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges goodwill impairments pricefixing settlements gains and losses on investments intangible asset amortization certain acquisitionrelated costs and the tax effect of all such items in addition certain other items may be excluded from nongaap financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors these nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not superior to or as a substitute for gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nongaap financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment’s operating results from local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes we also may use the term constant currency which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates we believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates 

refer to the nongaap financial measures section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap diluted eps in the presented periods 

business strategy and covid19 update 

in fiscal 2021 our enterprise comparable sales grew 97 as we leveraged our unique capabilities including our supply chain expertise flexible store operating model and ability to shift quickly to digital to meet what was clearly elevated demand for products that help customers work learn cook entertain and connect in their homes we provided customers with multiple options for how when and where they shopped with us to ensure it satisfied their need for safety and convenience the pandemic environment underscored our purpose to enrich lives through technology and the capabilities we strengthened in fiscal 2021 will benefit us going forward as we execute our strategy 

our strong financial performance allowed us to share our success with the community our shareholders and importantly our employees in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we made a 40 million donation to the best buy foundation to accelerate the progress towards our goal to reach 100 teen tech centers across the us we believe our teen tech centers help to further our commitments towards economic and social justice in our communities by making a measurable difference in the lives of underserved teens who may not otherwise have access to technology in addition we resumed our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and increased our quarterly dividend by 27 to 070 per share for our employees we provided hourly appreciation pay for those who were working on the frontlines paid recognition bonuses to field employees and established multiple hardship funds for anyone impacted physically emotionally or financially by covid19 starting august 1 2020 we also raised our starting wage to 15 per hour for all domestic employees and enhanced our employee benefits 

throughout the pandemic and across all the ways customers can shop we adhered to safety protocols that limited store capacity followed strict social distancing practices and used proper protective equipment including requiring our employees and customers to wear masks 

this covid19 pandemic and the shift in customer buying behavior underscores the importance of our strong multichannel capabilities in fiscal 2021 our domestic online revenue grew 144 compared to last year we believe it is essential to provide options that let customers choose what works best for them to best serve our customers during the pandemic we had to be innovative and flexible early in the year we quickly rolled out enhanced curbside pickup across our stores to provide our customers convenience when we made the difficult decision to close our stores in march 2020 in may 2020 we developed an instore appointment model that provided our customers with an option to shop in our stores as we prepared to open stores back up to customer shopping we developed solutions like virtual consultations with advisors and video chats with our store associates in addition we made significant improvements to the functionality and customer experience of our app to support shopping support and fulfillment we provided fulfillment options that customers have come to expect from all retailers like fast and free home delivery instore pickup and curbside pickup 

as we look forward the environment is still evolving and our operating model and supporting cost structure are evolving as well the pandemic has accelerated the evolution of retail and compelled us to change our operating model in the best interest of our employees and customers we have also expedited some planned strategic changes that we believe will allow us to emerge from this time even stronger 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 we made the difficult decision to exit our operations in mexico and began taking other actions to more broadly align our organizational structure in support of our strategy as a result we recorded 144 million of charges in our international segment in fiscal 2021 including 23 million of inventory markdowns within cost of sales and 121 million within restructuring charges primarily comprised of asset impairments currency translation adjustments and termination benefits as of january 30 2021 the exit was substantially complete and we do not expect to incur material future restructuring charges in fiscal 2022 related to the exit 

we also recorded 133 million of restructuring charges in our domestic segment in fiscal 2021 primarily related to termination benefits associated with field and corporate organizational changes in support of our strategy as well as impairments of technology assets held in service of our mexico operations 

as we continue to evolve our building the new blue strategy it is possible that we will incur material future restructuring costs but we are unable to forecast the timing and magnitude of such costs refer to note 2 restructuring  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we believe the following will be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic relevant to best buy 

• customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want our strategy is to embrace that reality and lead not follow 

• our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while also providing more flexible opportunities for our people 

• technology is playing an even more crucial role in people’s lives and as a result our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important said differently people are using technology to address their needs in ways they never contemplated before and we play a vital role in bringing technology to life for both customers and our vendor partners 

these implications are extensive and interdependent and we are as quickly as possible both implementing change today and assessing future changes across our entire business including how we evolve our stores and labor model and how we spend our investment dollars ‌ 

in summary during fiscal 2021 we managed through the challenging environment in a way that allowed us to accelerate many aspects of our strategy to deliver on our purpose our teams showed perseverance and commitment through the year and collectively changed the way we do business at a pace we never imagined 

results of operations 

in order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements we consolidate the financial results of our mexico operations on a onemonth lag consistent with such consolidation the financial and nonfinancial information presented in our mda relative to these operations is also presented on a lag our policy is to accelerate the recording of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements other than the restructuring charges incurred related to our decision to exit our operations in mexico no such events were identified for the periods presented

1 comparable online sales are included in the comparable sales calculation

liquidity and capital resources 

we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements depend on key variables including the level of investment required to support our business strategies the performance of our business capital expenditures credit facilities shortterm borrowing arrangements and working capital management capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which to a large extent we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy 

cash and cash equivalents were as follows  in millions 



the increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows and a reduction in share repurchases which were temporarily suspended from march to november of fiscal 2021 

cash flows 

cash flows from total operations were as follows  in millions 



operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to higher inventory turnover and the timing of inventory purchases and payments to meet continued higher demand the increase was also driven by the timing of payments related to accrued compensation and benefits and higher earnings 

investing activities

financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to lower share repurchases which were temporarily suspended from march to november of fiscal 2021

2 lease obligations exclude 56 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced

additionally we have 125 billion in undrawn capacity on our facility as of january 30 2021 which if drawn upon would be included as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k other than our adoption of accounting standards update “asu” 201602 leases  in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and our adoption of asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results these estimates require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty 

vendor allowances 

description 

we receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements for product advertising and product placement primarily in the form of allowances based on purchases or sales volumes we recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendors products are recorded as an offset to the related expense when incurred 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory these estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors including 1 proper classification of the type of funding received and 2 the methodology to estimate the portion of purchasesbased funding that should be recognized in cost of sales in each period which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sellthrough of inventory 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our vendor funding deferral as of january 30 2021 would have affected net earnings by approximately 33 million in fiscal 2021 the overall level of deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three years 

goodwill 

description 

goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an armslength transaction 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

determining fair value of a reporting unit is complex and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information such as trading multiples and other observable metrics cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors such as revenue growth rates expenses and capital expenditures market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables we have goodwill in two reporting units – best buy domestic and best buy health – with carrying values of 444 million and 542 million respectively as of january 30 2021 there is greater uncertainty surrounding the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the best buy health reporting unit and therefore a greater degree of complexity and judgment involved in our impairment analysis our valuation of best buy health incorporates relatively higher levels of revenue growth than our valuation of best buy domestic and consequently estimation of factors such as new customer growth customer retention rates capital expenditure requirements advertising and cost to serve expenses and weightedaverage cost of capital rates that incorporate significant judgment 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in the fair value of the best buy health reporting unit as of january 30 2021 would not have had a material effect on our net earnings in fiscal 2021 since acquisition our estimate of the fair value of best buy health has remained relatively stable 

inventory markdown 

description 

our merchandise inventories were 56 billion as of january 30 2021 we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis no adjustment is recorded for inventory that we are able to return to our vendors for full credit 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected revenue and incremental costs we will generate for current inventory such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates as well as factors such as product type and condition forecasted consumer demand product lifecycles promotional environment vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition we also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value such as vendor allowances and selling costs 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our markdown adjustment as of january 30 2021 would have affected net earnings by approximately 13 million in fiscal 2021 the level of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years 

tax contingencies 

description 

our income tax returns are periodically audited by us federal state and local and foreign taxing authorities taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we may record a liability for such exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors such as changes in tax law interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

service revenue 

description 

we sell support plans as part of a bundled service offer which may include items such as technical support price discounts on future purchases antivirus software and onetime service repairs we allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value for technical support services we typically recognize revenue over time on a usage basis an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term this method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns primarily derived from historical information 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

there is judgment in 1 measuring the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations and 2 assessing the appropriate recognition and methodology for each performance obligation and for those based on usage estimating the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of customers when insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until such history has accumulated 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of january 30 2021 would have affected net earnings by approximately 13 million in fiscal 2021 the amount of services membership deferred revenue has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years 

new accounting pronouncements 

for a description of new applicable accounting pronouncements see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in shortterm market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense our cash and cash equivalents generate interest income that will vary based on changes in shortterm interest rates in addition we have swapped a portion of our fixedrate debt to floatingrate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with shortterm interest rates refer to note 6 derivative instruments  and note 8 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our interest rate swaps 

in fiscal 2021 we entered into tlock contracts to hedge the base interest rate variability on a portion of our thenexpected refinancing of our maturing 2021 notes the tlock contracts were immaterial and cash settled upon issuance of our 2030 notes in fiscal 2021 the fair value of the tlock contracts upon settlement was released from accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets and recorded in interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings as interest is accrued over the life of the 2030 notes 

as of january 30 2021 we had 55 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 500 million of debt that has been swapped to floating rate and therefore the net balance exposed to interest rate changes was 50 billion as of january 30 2021 a 50basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 25 million reduction in net interest expense and conversely a 50basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 25 million increase in net interest expense 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international segment operations on a limited basis we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our canadian operations our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows as well as net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments which generally have terms of up to 12 months refer to note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these instruments 

in fiscal 2021 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were driven by the strength of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso and the canadia n dollar compared to the prioryear period which had a negative overall impact on our revenue as foreign currencies translated into fewer us dollars the strength of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso also had a favorable impact on earnings as the operating loss in mexican pesos translated into fewer us dollars we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately 45 million and a net favorable impact on earnings of approximately 15 million in fiscal 2021 excluding the r eclassification of cumulative translation adjustments into earnings as a result of our exit from mexico

competition 

our competitors are primarily multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers we believe our ability to help customers online in stores and in their homes and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs provides us key competitive advantages some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on 

price we carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and service providers as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities in addition we have pricematching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail stores and online operators in order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships we believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people our integrated online retail and in home assets our broad and curated product assortment our strong vendor partnerships our service and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage

 item 1a risk factors 

described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10k and in our other public disclosures the risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial all forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below 

we face strong competition from multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers vendors and mobile network carriers which directly affects our revenue and profitability 

while we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value the retail sector is highly competitive price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology the ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us 

the retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications and some onlineonly businesses have lower operating costs online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency could put pressure on our margins as these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability 

our strategy to expand into new products services and technologies brings new business financial and regulatory risks 

as we introduce new products and services using new technologies and applications we may have limited experience in these newer markets and regulatory environments and our customers may not like our new value propositions these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions failures or other issues for example as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology we may be subject to privacy and information security rules such as the health insurance portability and accountability act andor subject to increased potential liability risk 

this expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management employees operations systems technical expertise financial resources and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions in addition new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results they may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise 

in fiscal 2020 we continued to invest in our health strategy and our underlying purpose to enrich lives through technology the new healthrelated services offered might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of these services in addition the services and systems used could expose us to customer data privacy and information security risks as well as business or system interruption risks these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

we offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings including consultation delivery design installation memberships protection plans repair setup technical support and health safety and caregiving monitoring and support designing marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

• increased labor expense to fulfill our customer promises 

• pressure on traditional labor models to meet the evolving landscape of offerings and customer needs 

• increased risk of errors or omissions in the fulfillment of services 

• unpredictable extended warranty failure rates and related expenses 

• employees in transit using company vehicles to visit customer locations and employees being present in customer homes which may increase our scope of liability 

• the potential for increased scope of liability relating to managed services offerings 

• employees having access to customer devices including the information held on those devices which may increase our responsibility for the security of those devices and privacy of the data they hold 

• the engagement of third parties to assist with some aspects of construction and installation and the potential responsibility for the actions they undertake 

• the risk that inhome services could be more adversely impacted by inclement weather health and safety concerns and catastrophic events and 

• increased risk of noncompliance with new laws and regulations applicable to these services 

we are subject to risks associated with company transformation 

our transformational activities within the organization are necessary to fully support our strategic vision for future customer and income growth including our building the new blue strategy and any decreased capability to undertake those activities may have a material impact on achieving that strategy 

any limitations in organizational financial or operational infrastructure could decrease our ability to realize transformational objectives supporting our key strategic initiatives relating to our development of competitive advantages creating solutions for customers and providing differentiated value if we do not have access to or fail to dedicate the appropriate people management focus and resources to implementing these transformational objectives our longterm growth and profitability could be adversely affected 

our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors in fiscal 2020 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 79 of the merchandise we purchased with five suppliers  apple samsung hewlettpackard sony and lg  representing approximately 56 of total merchandise purchased we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise our profitability depends on our securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties while we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value and depend upon to varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brands with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues andor when there is less competition in addition vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer certain categories focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms 

we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry for example if carriers change the structure of contracts upgrade terms qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenue and profitability in addition our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels 

if we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our operations and profitability may be harmed changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability 

our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores service centers distribution centers field and corporate offices our strategy of offering highquality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce the turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee engagement our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities in addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations 

we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation and employerprovided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability market increases to employee hourly wage rates increased cost pressure on employerprovided benefits and our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and compensation and benefit packages could have a material impact to the profitability of our business 

we are subject to statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include but are not limited to 

• the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local national or international jurisdictions 

• the potential for unexpected costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy carbon emissions electronics recycling and water or product materials 

• the challenges of ensuring compliance with applicable product compliance laws and regulations with respect to both the products we sell and contract to manufacture including laws and regulations related to product safety and product transport 

• the financial operational and business impact of new regulations governing data privacy and security such as the california consumer privacy act ccpa 

• the impact of other new or changing statutes and regulations including but not limited to financial reform national labor relations board rule changes healthcare reform contracted worker labor laws corporate governance matters escheatment rules rules governing pricing content distribution copyright mobile communications electronic device certification or payment services andor other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure 

• the impact of litigation trends including class action lawsuits involving consumers and shareholders and labor and employment matters and 

• the impact of the general election on the development or changes in laws regulations and policies 

with respect to the ccpa which came into effect on january 1 2020 the statute provides new privacy rights for california residents and requires companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers allowing them to opt out of certain uses of their personal information in addition the california attorney general has issued proposed rules under the ccpa we cannot predict the impact of this firstofitskind statute and these rules that have not yet been finalized in addition to potential privacy and security legislation in other states and the us federal level on our business or operations but these legislative initiatives may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies interfere with intended business operations or lead us to incur incremental expenses in an effort to comply 

the impact of the potential implementation of more restrictive trade policies higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements in the us or countries where we sell our products and services or procure products could have a material adverse effect on our business in particular future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china could lead to the imposition of tariffs that could adversely affect our supply chain and our business and could require us to take action to mitigate those effects as we did in fiscal 2020 

further the impact of potential changes in us or other countries tax laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of existing laws including additional guidance and legislation related to the tax cuts and jobs act could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory activity that affects the retail sector has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance additionally defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters  

macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate including but not limited to the effects of novel coronavirus disease “covid 19” may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results 

to varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending as a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example 

• whether or not they make a purchase 

• their choice of brand model or pricepoint 

• how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices and 

• their appetite for complementary services for example protection plans 

real gdp growth consumer confidence the covid19 pandemic discussed in the following risk factor inflation employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact the macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

the impact of covid19 is expected to adversely affect our business and our financial results 

concerns have rapidly grown regarding the outbreak of covid19 as the pandemic continues to grow consumer fear about becoming ill with the virus and recommendations andor mandates from federal state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or selfquarantine have increased which will adversely affect traffic to our stores in particular we recently announced a shift to enhanced curbside service only for all of our stores on an interim basis further all inhome installation and repair has been temporarily suspended and all inhome consultations are being conducted virtually the significant reduction in customer visits to and spending at our stores caused by covid19 will likely result in a loss of sales and profits and other material adverse effects we may further restrict the operations of our stores and distribution facilities if we deem this necessary or if recommended or mandated by authorities and these measures could have a further material impact on our sales and profits also if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our business in the future 

covid19 also impacted our supply chain for products we sell particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where our products are manufactured we could also see significant disruptions to our supply chain in the us as well as significant deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us such as consumer spending 

in addition we expect to incur significant costs in our response to the pandemic including but not limited to costs incurred to 

implement the operational changes described above and certain payments to or other costs relating to employees who are not working during the pandemic 

the extent of the impact of covid19 on our business and financial results will also depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending all of which are highly uncertain 

failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

as discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues however some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors because of for example our extended retail footprint and structure our differential service offerings or our levels of customer service accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors we rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing services fulfillment staff planning and deployment financial management reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information 

our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks and other malicious actions catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees the failure or interruption of these information systems data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation 

our information technology systems could also be adversely affected by changes that result from covid19 including for example a significant increase in remote working of our employees and an increase in online orders due to restrictions on our retail operations 

we also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications if we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware software network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems it could cause system interruptions and delays disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels malicious attacks other technical difficulties or events outside of our control such as natural disasters power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services which could cause us to forgo material revenues incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation 

failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer employee vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage as well as litigation and enforcement actions 

our business involves the collection use and storage of personal information including payment card information as well as confidential information regarding our employees vendors and other company information we also share personal and confidential information with suppliers and other third parties as well as use thirdparty technology and systems which transmit information for a variety of activities we have been the target of attempted cyberattacks and other security threats and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems while we engage in significant dataprotection efforts criminal activity such as cyberattacks lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our privacy and security measures and as a result unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data or authorized parties may use or share personal information in an inappropriate manner furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and claims 

sensitive customer data may also be present on customerowned devices entrusted to us for service and repair vulnerable code on products sold or serviced including our exclusive brands may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture sell and service may not be effective resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships 

increasing costs associated with information security and privacy such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff costs of compliance costs resulting from fraud and costs of cyber and privacy insurance could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially additionally new laws such as the ccpa are expanding our obligations to protect the privacy and security of customer data requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk arising from a potential breach in addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk 

failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business 

we may decide to enter into new joint ventures partnerships alliances or acquisitions with third parties collectively new ventures assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors including for example 

• different and incremental business risks of the new venture not identified in our diligence assessments 

• failure to motivate and retain key employees of the new venture 

• uncertainty of forecasting financial performance 

• failure to integrate aspects of the new venture into our existing business such as new product or service offerings or information technology systems 

• failure to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting 

• failure to generate expected synergies such as cost reductions 

• unforeseen changes in the business environment of the new venture 

• disputes or strategic differences with other thirdparty participants in the new venture and 

• adverse impacts on relationships with vendors and other key partners of our existing business or the new venture 

if new ventures are unsuccessful our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired new ventures may also divert our financial resources and managements attention from other important areas of our business 

we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico in addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of competitive promotional activity new product release activity and customer buying patterns which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters changes in consumer demand economic factors product sourcing issues cyberattacks failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations as a result of these factors there is a risk that our fiscal fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected 

many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences 

we operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption this manifests itself in a variety of ways the emergence of new products and categories rapid maturation of categories cannibalization of categories declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles 

this rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time if we fail to interpret predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include failure to offer the products and services that our customers want having excess inventory which may require heavy discounting or liquidation inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply delays in adapting our merchandising marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends and damage to our brand and reputation these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs 

we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low or nointerest financing on qualifying purchases we believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases approximately 25 of our fiscal 2020 revenue was transacted using one of the companys branded cards in addition we earn profitshare income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs the income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors including the volume and value of transactions the terms of promotional financing offers bad debt rates interest rates the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs 

interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain including inbound deliveries from our vendors may adversely affect our business 

our supply chain is a critical part of our operations particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online we depend on our vendors abilities to deliver products to us at the right location right time and in the right quantities we also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network the factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include but are not limited to 

• interruptions to our delivery capabilities 

• failure of third parties to meet our standards or commitments 

• disruptions to our systems and the need to implement new systems 

• limitations in capacity 

• consolidation or business failures in the transportation and distribution sectors 

• labor strikes or slowdowns impacting ports or any other aspect of our supply chain 

• diseases pandemics including covid19 outbreaks and other healthrelated concerns which have resulted in and could continue to result in closed factories reduced workforces scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas 

• damages or other loss to products and 

• increasing transportation costs 

it is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands any disruption to or inefficiency in our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business the continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks if we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability 

catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results 

the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance such events may be caused by for example 

• natural disasters or extreme weather events 

• diseases or pandemics including covid19 that have affected and may continue to affect our employees customers or partners 

• floods fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties employees or customers or 

• terrorism civil unrest mass violence or violent acts or other conflicts 

in recent years we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain events in many of our markets such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network they can also affect our information technology systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focused consumer experience approach 

we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation we believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success operational factors such as failure to deliver high quality services uncompetitive pricing failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation external factors such as negative public remarks or accusations could also be damaging the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in among other things declines in revenues and customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

if the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation recalls of products particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model 

as an employer of nearly 125000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including for example 

• the organization of unions and related regulations that affect the nature of labor relations changes to which the national labor relations board continually considers 

• laws that impact the relationship between the company and independent contractors and 

• laws that impact minimum wage sick time paid leave and scheduling requirements could directly or indirectly increase our payroll costs andor impact the level of service we are able to provide 

changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation our ability to continue operations and our profitability 

failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 

effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multichannel strategy failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability most of our properties are leased of which some are subject to longterm leases as such it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our longterm real estate strategy such factors include for example 

• changing patterns of customer consumption and behavior particularly in light of an evolving multichannel environment 

• the location and appropriate number of stores in our portfolio 

• the interior layout format and size of our stores 

• the products and services we offer at each store 

• the local competitive positioning trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores 

• the primary term lease commitment and longterm lease option coverage for each store 

• the occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents and 

• our supply chain service location network strategy 

if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example 

• closing stores and abandoning the related assets while retaining the financial commitments of the leases 

• incurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores 

• operating stores supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business and 

• bearing excessive lease expenses 

these consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity 

for leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant in addition to rent we are still responsible for taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant 

constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 

we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders these factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 

any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 

we utilize thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our operations and any material disruption in our relationship or their services might have an impact to our business 

we engage key thirdparty business partners to support various functions of our business including but not limited to information technology web hosting and cloudbased services human resource operations customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards gift cards customer warranty delivery and installation technical support transportation and insurance programs any material disruption in our relationship with key thirdparty business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods 

our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results 

sales of our exclusive brands products which include dynex insignia modal platinum and rocketfish branded products as well as other products such as jitterbug lively mobile and lively mobile plus represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

• we have greater exposure and responsibility to consumers for warranty replacements and repairs as a result of exclusive brand product defects and our recourse to contract manufacturers for such warranty liabilities may be limited in foreign jurisdictions 

• we may be subject to regulatory compliance andor product liability claims relating to personal injury death or property damage caused by exclusive brand products some of which may require us to take significant actions such as product recalls 

• we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience disruptions in manufacturing and logistics due to covid19 and we may experience disruptions in manufacturing or logistics in the future due to inconsistent and unanticipated order patterns our inability to develop longterm relationships with key manufacturers other diseases or pandemics or unforeseen natural disasters 

• we may not be able to locate manufacturers that meet our internal standards whether for new exclusive brand products or for migration of the manufacturing of products from an existing manufacturer 

• we may be subject to a greater risk of inventory obsolescence as we do not generally have return to vendor rights 

• we are subject to developing and oftenchanging labor and environmental laws for the manufacture of products in foreign countries and we may be unable to conform to new rules or interpretations in a timely manner 

• we may be subject to claims by technology or other intellectual property owners if we inadvertently infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights or if we fail to pay royalties owed on our exclusive brand products 

• our operations may be disrupted by trade disputes or excessive tariffs including any future trade disputes or future phases of trade negotiations with china and we may not be able to source alternatives quickly enough to avoid interruptions in product supply 

• we may be unable to obtain or adequately protect patents and other intellectual property rights on our exclusive brand products or manufacturing processes and 

• regulations regarding disclosure of efforts to identify the country of origin of “conflict minerals” in certain portions of our supply chain could increase the cost of doing business and depending on the findings of our country of origin inquiry could have an adverse effect on our reputation 

maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them 

we are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the us 

our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us risks such as political or economic instability crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs merchandise quality issues product safety concerns work stoppages port delays foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics including covid19 and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities and may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above as well as to risks associated with the legislative judicial regulatory political economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

we operate retail locations in canada and mexico in addition most of our exclusive brand products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia we also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries including barbados bermuda china hong kong luxembourg the republic of mauritius and the uk during fiscal 2020 our international segments operations generated 8 of our revenue in general the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations in addition our international operations also expose us to other risks including those related to for example 

• political conditions and geopolitical events including war and terrorism 

• economic conditions including monetary and fiscal policies and tax rules as well as foreign exchange rate risk 

• rules governing international trade and potential changes to trade policies or trade agreements and ownership of foreign entities 

• governmentimposed travel restrictions or warnings whether in response to the covid19 pandemic or otherwise and differing responses of governmental authorities to pandemics and other global events 

• cultural differences that we may be unable to anticipate or respond to appropriately 

• different rules or practices regarding employee relations including the existence of works councils or unions 

• difficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights and 

• difficulties encountered in exerting appropriate management oversight to operations in remote locations 

these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs 

failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price 

we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forwardlooking information for future periods although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depend on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide if our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline

overview 

our purpose is to enrich the lives of consumers through technology we have two reportable segments domestic and international the domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states districts and territories of the us under various brand names including best buy best buy business best buy express best buy health cst geek squad greatcall lively magnolia and pacific kitchen and home and the domain names bestbuycom and greatcallcom the international segment is comprised of all operations in canada and mexico under the brand names best buy best buy express best buy mobile and geek squad and the domain names bestbuyca and bestbuycommx 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included 52 weeks while fiscal 2018 included 53 weeks with the additional week occurring in the fiscal fourth quarter our business like that of many retailers is seasonal a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico 

comparable sales 

throughout this mda we refer to comparable sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 we refined our methodology for calculating comparable sales it now reflects certain revenue streams previously excluded from the comparable sales calculation such as credit card revenue gift card breakage commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers as applicable the impact of adopting these changes is immaterial to all periods presented and therefore priorperiod comparable sales disclosures have not been restated our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year relocated stores as well as remodeled expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition the calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our international segment only the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods 

on march 1 2018 we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining best buy mobile standalone stores in the us as a result all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in march 2018 on october 1 2018 we acquired all outstanding shares of greatcall inc “greatcall” and on may 9 2019 we acquired all outstanding shares of critical signal technologies inc “cst”  consistent with our comparable sales policy the results of greatcall are included in our comparable sales calculation beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and the results of cst are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for the periods presented 

nongaap financial measures 

this mda includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap as well as certain adjusted or nongaap financial measures such as constant currency nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap diluted earnings per share eps from continuing operations we believe that nongaap financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance for these reasons our internal management reporting also includes nongaap financial measures generally our nongaap financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges goodwill impairments gains and losses on investments intangible asset amortization certain acquisitionrelated costs and the tax effect of all such items in addition certain other items may be excluded from nongaap financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors these nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not superior to or as a substitute for gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nongaap financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment’s operating results from local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes we also may use the term constant currency which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates we 

believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates 

refer to the nongaap financial measures section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap diluted eps from continuing operations in the presented periods 

business strategy

impact of covid19 

we are closely monitoring the impact of covid19 on all aspects of our business and in all of our locations we are making the best decisions we can with two goals in mind protecting employees customers and their respective families while trying our best to serve our customers who rely on us for increasingly vital technology we have seen increased demand for products that people need to work or learn from home as well as those products that allow people to refrigerate or freeze food as we meet the demand for these necessities we are adjusting how we operate in many ways to improve safety for example e xcept where otherwise directed by state and local authorities o n march 22 2020 we shifted to enhanced curbside service only for all of our us stores on an interim basis customers can also still order online or via the best buy app and have their products shipped directly to their homes large products such as appliances will be delivered where permitted and under strict safety guidelines with doorstep dropoff deliveries only all inhome installation and repair has been temporarily suspended and all inhome consultations are being conducted virtually we may further restrict the operations of our stores and distribution facilities and these measures could have a material impact on our revenues and profits covid19 could also lead to significant disruption to our supply chain for products we sell and could trigger a significant deterioration in macroeconomic factors that typically affect us such as consumer spending 

all best buy employees have been told they do not have to work if they do not feel comfortable and to stay home if they are feeling sick knowing they will be paid all field employees whose hours have been eliminated will be paid for two weeks at their normal wage rate based on their average hours worked over the last 10 weeks 

it is not possible to predict the likelihood timing or severity of the aforementioned direct and indirect impacts of covid19 on our business in light of the uncertainty in this fluid environment on march 19 2020 we drew the full amount of our 125 billion revolving credit facility and temporarily suspended all share repurchases 

tariffs 

during fiscal 2020 we worked to actively address the risks related to increases to tariff rates and proposed new tariffs on chinese imports in may 2019 the us trade representative “ustr” increased the tariff on list 3 products imported from china from 10 to 25 effective june 15 2019 the ustr also implemented a list 4 tariff of 15 on additional products imported from china the list 4 tariffs had two effective dates the first effective date list 4a was september 1 2019 and the most notable affected categories relative to best buy on this list are televisions smart watches and headphones the second effective date list 4b was december 15 2019 and the most notable affected categories relative to best buy on this list are computing mobile phones and gaming consoles on january 15 2020 the us and china completed a “phase one” trade agreement under the agreement list 4a tariffs were reduced from 15 to 75 effective 30 days later list 4b tariffs were suspended indefinitely and list 13 tariffs of 25 were maintained there was no timeline given for additional phases or tariff actions to begin or to be concluded throughout fiscal 2020 we were able to minimize the impact of tariffs on our business by accelerating purchases and working with our vendors some of which are in the process of migrating their manufacturing out of china factoring tariffs into our product assortment decisions promotional and pricing strategies sourcing changes and other strategies in partnership with our vendors however future trade disputes with china or future phases of trade negotiations between the us and china could lead to the imposition of new tariffs or other adverse consequences for our business

liquidity and capital resources 

summary 

we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements depend on key variables including the level of investment required to support our business strategies the performance of our business capital expenditures credit facilities shortterm borrowing arrangements and working capital management capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our 

cash flow and capital management strategy which to a large extent we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy 

cash and cash equivalents were as follows  in millions 



the increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to cash generated from operations partially offset by share repurchases investments in capital expenditures and dividends 

cash flows 

cash flows from total operations were as follows  in millions 



operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to changes in working capital primarily due to the timing of receipts and payments on inventory the timing of deliveries of inventory to customers increased earnings and lower incentive compensation payments due to a special onetime incentive payment in fiscal 2019 this was partially offset by the timing of collections on receivables and the timing of tax payments 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was primarily due to decreases in sales and increases in purchases of investments partially offset by a decrease in cash used in the acquisitions of cst and biosensics in fiscal 2020 compared to the acquisition of greatcall in fiscal 2019 

financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in shares repurchased during fiscal 2020 and the repayment in fiscal 2019 of our 500 million principal amount of notes due august 1 2018 this was partially offset by the issuance in fiscal 2019 of our 500 million principal amount of notes due october 1 2028 

sources of liquidity 

funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures share repurchases dividends and strategic initiatives including business combinations however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to limit our spending there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing if necessary on favorable terms 

we have a 125 billion fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility the facility” with a syndicate of banks that expires in april 2023 there were no borrowings under the facility during fiscal 2020 on march 19 2020 we drew down the full amount of the facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of covid19 refer to note 6 debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

our ability to continue to access the facility is subject to our compliance with its terms and conditions including financial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios at february 1 2020 we were in compliance with all financial covenants if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt it would likely constitute an event of default under our facility as well 

our credit ratings and outlook at march 18 2020 are summarized below on october 30 2019 fitch affirmed its bbb rating and withdrew all future ratings for commercial reasons on march 9 2020 moody’s concluded their review for upgrade that was initiated on november 20 2019 and confirmed its current rating of baa1 and changed its outlook to stable from rating under review standard  poor’s rating and outlook remained unchanged from the prior year 



credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to review at any time factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur they could impact among other things interest costs for certain of our credit facilities our future borrowing costs access to capital markets vendor financing terms and future newstore leasing costs 

restricted cash 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for workers compensation and general liability insurance claims restricted cash which is included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets was 126 million and 204 million at february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 respectively the decrease was due to a dividend of excess cash from our whollyowned insurance captive that manages a portion of our selfinsured claims 

capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures typically include investments in our stores distribution capabilities and information technology enhancements including ecommerce capital expenditures were as follows  in millions 



1 includes store remodels and various merchandising projects 

2 total capital expenditures exclude noncash capital expenditures of 10 million 53 million and 123 million for fiscal 2020 fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively noncash capital expenditures are comprised of capitalized leases as well as additions to property and equipment included in accounts payable 

debt and capital

share repurchases and dividends 

we repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors board the payment of cash dividends is also subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions our longterm capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investmentgrade credit metrics 

on february 23 2019 our board authorized a 30 billion share repurchase program as of february 1 2020 20 billion of the 30 billion share repurchase authorization was available between the end of fiscal 2020 on february 1 2020 and march 18 2020 we repurchased an incremental 06 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 56 million we have since temporarily suspended all share repurchases 

share repurchase and dividend activity were as follows in millions except per share amounts 



dividends declared and paid increased in fiscal 2020 due to an increase in the regular quarterly cash dividends per share partially offset by fewer shares outstanding due to the return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases 

on february 27 2020 our board authorized a 10 increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 055 per share effective immediately 

other financial measures 

our current ratio calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities was 11 as of february 1 2020 compared to 12 as of february 2 2019 our debt to earnings ratio calculated as total debt including current portion divided by net earnings from continuing operations was 08 as of february 1 2020 compared to 09 as of february 2 2019 the decline in both ratios was primarily due to the adoption of new lease accountin g guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 that resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet  refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  and note 10 leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding this adoption 

offbalancesheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

we do not have outstanding offbalancesheet arrangements contractual obligations as of february 1 2020 were as follows  in millions 



note for additional information refer to note 5 derivative instruments  note 6 debt  note 10 leases  note 11 income taxes  and note 13 contingencies and commitments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k

3 lease obligations exclude 158 million of legally binding fixed costs for leases signed but not yet commenced  

4 operating lease obligations exclude payments to landlords covering real estate taxes and common area maintenance these charges if included would increase total operating lease obligations by 07 billion at february 1 2020 

5 purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable are legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without penalty additionally although they do not contain legally binding purchase commitments we included open purchase orders in the table above substantially all open purchase orders are fulfilled within 30 days 

6 unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions as we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time the related balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 

7 included in longterm liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at february 1 2020 was a 22 million obligation for deferred compensation as the specific payment dates for deferred compensation are unknown the related balances have not been reflected in the payments due by period section of the table 

additionally we had 125 billion in undrawn capacity on our credit facility at february 1 2020 on march 19 2020 we drew down the full amount of the facility to increase our cash position and maximize flexibility in light of the uncertainty surrounding the impact of covid19 the proceeds and resulting liability from the facility will be included in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm debt respectively on our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k other than our adoption of asu 201602 leases  in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and our adoption of asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results these estimates require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty 

vendor allowances 

description 

we receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements primarily in the form of purchasesbased or salesbased volumes and for product advertising and placement in our stores we recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold if the funds are not specifically related to purchase or sales volumes the funds are recognized ratably over the performance period as the product promotion or placement is completed funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendors products are recorded as an offset to the related expense when incurred 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory these estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors including 1 proper classification of the type of funding received and 2 the methodology to estimate the portion of purchasesbased funding that should be recognized in cost of sales which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sellthrough of inventory 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our vendor funding deferral at february 1 2020 would have affected net earnings by approximately 32 million in fiscal 2020 

goodwill 

description 

goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an armslength transaction 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

determining fair value of a reporting unit is complex and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information such as trading multiples when applicable cash flow analysis requires judgment regarding many factors such as revenue growth rates expenses and capital expenditures market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables we have goodwill in two reporting units – best buy domestic and best buy health – with carrying values of 443 million and 541 million respectively as of february 1 2020 there is greater uncertainty surrounding the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the best buy health reporting unit and therefore a greater degree of complexity and judgment involved in our impairment analysis in particular our analysis of the best buy health reporting unit fair value includes estimation of revenue growth rates capital expenditure requirements and weightedaverage cost of capital rates that incorporate significant judgment 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in the fair value of the best buy health reporting unit at february 1 2020 would not have a material effect on our net earnings 

inventory markdown 

description 

our merchandise inventories were 52 billion at february 1 2020 we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis no adjustment is recorded for inventory that we are able to return to our vendors for full credit 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected recovery rates the determination of the expected recovery rates includes the evaluation of historical recovery rates as well as factors such as product type and condition forecasted consumer demand product lifecycles the promotional environment vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition we also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value such as vendor allowances and selling costs 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our markdown adjustment at february 1 2020 would have affected net earnings by approximately 11 million in fiscal 2020 

tax contingencies 

description 

our income tax returns are periodically audited by us federal state and local and foreign tax authorities tax authorities audit our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our 

various tax filing positions we may record a liability for such exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors such as changes in tax law interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

service revenue 

description 

we sell customers support plans as part of a bundled service offer which may include items such as technical support extended warranty price discounts on future purchases antivirus software and onetime service repairs we allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value for technical support membership contracts we typically recognize revenue over time on a usage basis an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term this method involves the use of expected usage patterns derived from historic information 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

there is judgment in 1 determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts 2 measuring the relative standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only bundled and sold to customers with other performance obligations or alternatively using a costplus margin approach and 3 assessing the pattern of delivery across multiple portfolios of customers including estimating current and future usage patterns when insufficient history of usage is available we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of february 1 2020 would have affected net earnings by approximately 12 million in fiscal 2020

we are exposed to changes in shortterm market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense our cash and cash equivalents generate interest income that will vary based on changes in shortterm interest rates in addition we have swapped our fixedrate debt to floatingrate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with shortterm interest rates refer to note 5 derivative instruments  and note 6 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our interest rate swaps 

as of february 1 2020 we had 22 billion of cash and cash equivalents and 12 billion of debt that has been swapped to floating rate and therefore the net balance exposed to interest rate changes was 10 billion as of february 1 2020 a 50basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 5 million reduction in net interest expense and conversely a 50basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 5 million increase in net interest expense 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international segment operations on a limited basis we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our canadian operations our primary objective in 

holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows as well as net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments which generally have terms of up to 12 months refer to note 5 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these instruments 

foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations were primarily driven by the strength of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar compared to the prioryear period which had a negative overall impact on our revenue as our canadian dollar revenue translated into fewer us dollars we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately 29 million and a net favorable impact on earnings of approximately 1 million in fiscal 2020 ‎

international segment 

our canada and mexico distribution model is similar to that of our domestic segment 

suppliers and inventory 

our domestic and international segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers in fiscal 2019 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 64 of the merchandise we purchased with five suppliers – apple samsung hewlettpackard sony and lg – representing approximately 51 of total merchandise purchased we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements 

we carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible key elements to our inventory management process include the following continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels and pricing agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products

competition 

our competitors are primarily multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers we believe our ability to help customers online in stores and in their homes and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs offers us key competitive advantages some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price in the us onlineonly retailers historically were not generally required to collect sales taxes in certain states however a june 2018 supreme court decision  south dakota v wayfair  authorized states to require onlineonly retailers to collect and remit sales taxes as a result the onlineonly sales tax advantage of some of our competitors will continue to erode as more states require onlineonly retailers to collect sales tax we carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities in addition we have pricematching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail stores and online operators in order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships we believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people our integrated online retail and inhome assets our broad and curated product assortment our strong vendor partnerships our service and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage

 item 1a risk factors 

described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10k and in our other public disclosures the risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial all forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below 

we face strong competition from multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers vendors and mobile network carriers which directly affects our revenue and profitability 

while we constantly strive to offer consumers the best value the retail sector is highly competitive price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology the ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as some of our vendors and mobile network carriers that market their products directly to consumers competition may also result from new entrants into the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us 

the retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications and some onlineonly businesses have lower operating costs online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be 

competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency could put pressure on our margins 

as these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability 

our strategy to expand into new products services and technologies brings new business financial and regulatory risks 

as we introduce new products and services using new technologies and applications we may have limited experience in these newer market segments and our customers may not like our new value propositions these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions failures or other issues for example as our value proposition evolves to support the healthcare industry with technology we may be subject to privacy and information security rules such as the health insurance portability and accountability act andor subject to increased potential liability risk 

this expanded risk increases the complexity of our business and places significant responsibility on our management employees operations systems technical expertise financial resources and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions in addition new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results they may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise 

as a part of our strategy to enrich lives through technology we are entering the health area growing organically as well as inorganically in fiscal 2019 we acquired greatcall which provides emergency concierge and monitoring services to subscribed customers such services might expose us to liability risk resulting from failures in the fulfillment of our services in addition the services and systems used could expose us to customer data information security as well as business or system interruption risks these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

we offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings including consultation delivery design installation memberships protection plans repair setup technical support and health safety and caregiving monitoring and support designing marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

 

our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors in fiscal 2019 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 64 of the merchandise we purchased 70 in fiscal 2018 with five suppliers  apple samsung hewlettpackard sony and lg  representing approximately 51 of total merchandise purchased 56 in fiscal 2018 we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties while we believe we offer capabilities that these vendors value 

and depend upon to varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brands with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues andor when there is less competition in addition vendors may decide to cease allowing us to offer certain categories focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms 

we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry for example if carriers change the structure of customer contracts customer upgrade terms customer qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenue and profitability in addition our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels 

if we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our operations and profitability may be harmed changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability 

our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores service centers distribution centers field and corporate offices our strategy of offering highquality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce the turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation and benefit packages failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities in addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations 

we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability market increases to field employee hourly wage rates along with our ability to implement corresponding adjustments within our labor model and wage rates could have a material impact to the profitability of our business 

we are subject to certain statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are 



services andor other as yet unknown legislation that could affect how we operate and execute our strategies as well as alter our expense structure 

 

regulatory activity focused on the retail sector has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance additionally defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters 

macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results 

to varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending as a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example 

 

real gdp growth consumer confidence inflation employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer geopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned might also impact the macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

as discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues however some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors because of for example our extended retail footprint and structure our differential service offerings or our levels of customer service accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors we rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing services fulfillment staff planning and deployment financial management reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information 

our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks and other malicious actions catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees the failure or interruption of these information systems data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation 

we also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications if we fail to secure these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware software network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems it could cause system interruptions and delays disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels malicious attacks other technical difficulties or 

events outside of our control such as natural disasters power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services which could cause us to forgo material revenues incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation 

failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer employee vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage as well as litigation and enforcement actions 

our business involves the collection use and storage of customer information including payment card information as well as confidential information regarding our employees vendors and other company information we also share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties as well as use thirdparty technology and systems which transmit customer information for a variety of activities while we take significant steps to protect this information external criminal activity such as cyberattacks lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our privacy and security measures and unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and claims 

sensitive customer data may also be present on customerowned devices entrusted to us for service and repair vulnerable code on products sold or serviced including our exclusive brands may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture sell and service may not be effective resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships 

increasing costs associated with information security and customer data privacy such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff costs of compliance costs resulting from fraud and costs of cyber and privacy insurance could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially additionally new laws like the general data protection regulation and ccpa are expanding company obligations to protect the privacy of customer data requiring additional resources and creating incremental risk of potential breach in addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk 

failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business 

we may decide to enter into new joint ventures partnerships alliances or acquisitions with third parties collectively new ventures assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors including for example 

 

if new ventures are unsuccessful our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired new ventures may also divert our financial resources and managements attention from other important areas of our business 

we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico in addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns which makes it 

difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters changes in consumer demand economic factors product sourcing issues cyberattacks failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations as a result of these factors there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected 

many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences 

we operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technology innovation and disruption this manifests itself in a variety of ways emergence of new products and categories rapid maturation of categories cannibalization of categories declining price points and product replacement and upgrade cycles 

this rapid pace of change can be hard to predict and manage and there is no guarantee we can effectively do this all the time if we fail to interpret predict and react to these changes in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include failure to offer the products and services that our customers want having excess inventory which may require heavy discounting or liquidation inability to secure adequate access to brands or products for which consumer demand exceeds supply delays in adapting our merchandising marketing or supply chain capabilities to accommodate changes in product trends and damage to our brand and reputation 

these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs 

we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low or nointerest financing on qualifying purchases we believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases approximately 25 of our fiscal 2019 revenue was transacted using one of the companys branded cards in addition we earn profitshare income and share in any losses from certain of our banking partners based on the performance of the programs the income or loss we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors including the volume and value of transactions the terms of promotional financing offers bad debt rates interest rates the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits or losses of the programs 

interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain including inbound deliveries from our vendors may adversely affect our business 

our supply chain is a critical part of our operations particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online we depend on our vendors abilities to deliver products to us at the right location right time and in the right quantities we also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network the factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include 

 

it is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands any disruption to or inefficiency in our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business the continuing growth of online purchases for delivery increases our exposure to these risks if we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability 

catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results 

the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance such events may be caused by for example 

 

in recent years we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain events in many of our markets such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network they can also affect our information technology systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition 

we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation we believe that recognition and the reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success operational factors such as for example failure to deliver high quality services uncompetitive pricing failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation external factors such as negative public remarks or accusations could also be damaging the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in among other things declines in revenues and customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues all of which could materially adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

if the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation recalls of products particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model 

as an employer of nearly 125000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including for example 

 

changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation our ability to continue operations and our profitability 

in addition although as of february 2 2019 none of our us operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements any future organizing activity could adversely affect our costs and our results of operations 

failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 

effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multichannel strategy failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability most of our properties are leased of which some are subject to longterm leases as such it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our longterm real estate strategy such factors include for example 

 

if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example 

 

these consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity 

for leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant in addition to rent we are still responsible for taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant 

constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 

we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders these factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 

any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 

we utilize thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our operations and any material disruption in our relationship or their services might have an impact to our business 

we engage key thirdparty business partners to support various functions of our business including but not limited to information technology web hosting and cloudbased services human resource operations customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards gift cards customer warranty delivery and installation technical support transportation and insurance programs any material disruption in our relationship with key thirdparty business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods 

our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results 

sales of our exclusive brands products which include dynex insignia modal platinum and rocketfish branded products represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them 

we are subject to risks associated with vendors that source products outside of the us 

our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our internal standards of quality and safety can be difficult especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us risks such as political or economic instability crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs merchandise quality issues product safety concerns work stoppages port delays foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities and may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies 

these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above as well as to risks associated with the legislative judicial regulatory political economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

we operate retail locations in canada and mexico in addition most of our exclusive brand products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia we also have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries including barbados bermuda china hong kong luxembourg the republic of mauritius turks and caicos and the uk during fiscal 2019 our international segments operations generated 8 of our revenue in general the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations in addition our international operations also expose us to other risks including those related to for example 

 

these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs 

failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price 

we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forwardlooking information for future periods although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate and profit margins we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide if our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results unless otherwise noted transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude our mda is presented in the following sections 

 

our mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we strive to enrich the lives of consumers through technology whether they connect with us online visit our stores or invite us into their homes we do this by solving technology problems and addressing key human needs across a range of areas including entertainment productivity communication food preparation security and health and wellness we have operations in the us canada and mexico we have two reportable segments domestic and international the domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states districts and territories of the us including greatcall the international segment is comprised of all operations in canada and mexico 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 included 52 weeks while fiscal 2018 included 53 weeks with the additional week occurring in the fiscal fourth quarter our business like that of many retailers is seasonal a large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico 

throughout this mda we refer to comparable sales our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year relocated stores as well as remodeled expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition the calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our international segment only and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018 the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods 

the canadian brand consolidation which included the permanent closure of 66 future shop stores the conversion of 65 future shop stores to best buy stores and the elimination of the future shop website had a material impact on a yearoveryear basis on the remaining canadian retail stores and the website as such from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017 all canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the international segment no longer had a comparable metric therefore consolidated comparable sales equaled the domestic segment comparable sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we resumed reporting international comparable sales as revenue and the international segment was once again deemed to be comparable and as such consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of domestic and international comparable sales however we have not provided international comparable sales for fiscal 2017 as the calculation would only include comparable revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and may be misleading in future periods when used for comparison purposes on march 1 2018 we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining best buy mobile standalone stores in the us as a result all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in march 2018 on october 1 2018 we acquired all outstanding shares of greatcall consistent with our comparable sales policy the results of greatcall are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for fiscal 2019 

nongaap financial measures 

this mda includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap as well as certain adjusted or nongaap financial measures such as constant currency nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap diluted earnings per share eps from continuing operations we believe that nongaap financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance for these reasons our internal management reporting also includes nongaap financial measures generally our nongaap financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges goodwill impairments gains and losses on investments certain acquisitionrelated costs and the tax effect of all such items in addition certain other items may be excluded from nongaap financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors these nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not superior to or as a substitute for gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nongaap financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment’s operating results from local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes we also may use the term constant currency which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates we believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates 

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we no longer exclude nonrestructuring property and equipment impairment charges from our nongaap financial metrics when we began to execute our renew blue transformation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we adopted a change to nongaap reporting to exclude nonrestructuring property and equipment impairment charges from our nongaap results from that point through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we believed that reporting nongaap results that excluded these charges provided a supplemental view of our ongoing performance that was useful and relevant to our investors now that renew blue has ended and best buy 2020 has officially launched we believe it is no longer necessary to adjust for nonrestructuring property and equipment impairments in our nongaap reporting we believe that future such impairments will predominantly be immaterial and incurred in the ordinary scope of ongoing operations 

accordingly commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we no longer adjust for nonrestructuring property and equipment impairments impacted prior period nongaap financial measures have been recast to conform with this presentation 

refer to the  nongaap financial measures  section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate and nongaap diluted eps from continuing operations in the presented periods 

business strategy 

on a fullyear basis in fiscal 2019 we grew our enterprise comparable sales by 48 on top of 56 in fiscal 2018 increased gaap diluted eps by 595 to 520 and increased our nongaap diluted eps by 204 to 532 in addition we recorded annual revenue of 429 billion gaap operating income of 19 billion and nongaap operating income of 20 billion in fiscal 2019 from a capital allocation standpoint we returned 20 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

strategically we made significant progress in implementing our best buy 2020 strategy to enrich lives through technology and further develop our competitive differentiation by expanding what we do for our customers and how we interact with them the first example is the launch of our total tech support program having a service that provides members unlimited geek squad support for all their technology no matter where or when they bought it is a compelling value proposition for our members we also expanded our inhome advisor program from 300 advisors to approximately 530 advisors and provided more than 175000 free inhome consultations to customers across the nation in health we acquired a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers greatcall and took a tangible step forward in our strategy to help seniors live longer in their homes with the help of technology we continued to elevate the customer experience around product fulfillment enabled by the advancement of our supply chain transformation 

in parallel to the customer experience work we continued to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and offset pressures during fiscal 2019 we achieved 265 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies bringing the cumulative total to 500 million towards our current goal set in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 to reach 600 million by the end of fiscal 2021 

in addition to these accomplishments we are proud of our progress in advancing our corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts in fact we were just named number one on barron’s annual “100 most sustainable companies” list 

looking ahead we are focused on pursuing the opportunities in front of us to enrich lives through technology and provide services and solutions that solve real customer needs and build deeper customer relationships and the related value creation opportunities that this entails 

in fiscal 2020 our priorities include increasing our total tech support member base growing our health business and continuing to expand our inhome advisor program we will also continue to innovate and design multichannel experiences that solve customer needs across our website app and other channels in ways that enhance the experience across online and physical shopping and continue with our supply chain transformation including using automation and process improvements to expand fulfillment options increase delivery speed and improve delivery and installation in addition as has been our brand over the last several years we will endeavor to keep driving cost reductions and efficiencies throughout the business

our domestic segment experienced a decrease in gross profit rate to 233  in fiscal 2019 from 234  in fiscal 2018 this rate decrease was primarily driven by higher supply chain costs including investments and higher transportation costs and a decrease in our periodic profitshare revenue as described above these decreases were partially offset by improved product margin rates which included the benefit of gross profit optimization initiatives and the higher gross profit rate of greatcall 

our domestic segment sga decreased 4 million and the rate decreased to 186  of revenue in fiscal 2019 compared to 189  of revenue in fiscal 2018 the decrease was primarily due to cost reductions the absence of the extra week in fiscal 2019 and onetime expenses related to tax reform recorded in fiscal 2018 these decreases were partially offset by increases in growth investments higher variable costs associated with increased revenue and increases as a result of the acquisition of greatcall

our domestic segment experienced a decrease in gross profit rate to 234 in fiscal 2018 from 239 in fiscal 2017 this rate decrease was primarily due to the 183 million of cathode ray tube crt settlement proceeds recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and a decrease in our periodic profitshare revenue as described above partially offset by improved margin rates across multiple categories 

our domestic segment sga rate remained flat at 189  of revenue in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 sga increased in fiscal 2018 due to 1 higher incentive compensation for store and corporate employees 2 investments in growth initiatives 3 the impact of the extra week 4 onetime expenses related to tax reform which included 75 million related to employee bonus expense and a 20 million charitable donation to the best buy foundation and 5 higher variable costs due to increased revenue these increases were offset by cost reductions and 22 million in crt settlement legal fees incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 that did not recur in fiscal 2018

our international segment recorded a restructuring benefit of 1 million  and restructuring charges of 1 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively restructuring activity in both years relates to adjustments to our vacant space liabilities outstanding as a result of the canadian brand consolidation and the renew blue plans the adjustments were due to changes in estimates related to sublease income refer to note 9 restructuring charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our restructuring activities

as noted above comparable sales information has not been provided for the international segment for fiscal 2017 due to the canadian brand consolidation as such it is also impractical to provide such information on a revenue category basis beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we resumed reporting international comparable sales as revenue and the international segment was once again determined to be comparable 

the following is a description of the notable comparable sales changes in our international segment by revenue category in fiscal 2018 

 

our international segment experienced a gross profit increase of 21 million or 27 in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 primarily related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the increase in gross profit was 3 million however the gross profit rate decreased to 232 in fiscal 2018 from 250 of revenue in fiscal 2017 this decrease in rate was primarily due to lower yearoveryear periodic profitshare revenue and lower sales in the highermargin services category in canada this was primarily driven by the launch of our total tech support offer an ongoing service revenue model that carries a higher salesattach rate but a lower gross profit rate 

our international segments sga increased 27 million or 39 in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the increase in sga was 12 million however the sga rate decreased to 206 in fiscal 2018 from 219 of revenue in fiscal 2017 the increase in sga was primarily driven by the impact of the extra week and a onetime employee bonus expense related to tax reform partially offset by lower payroll and benefits and administrative costs

additional consolidated results 

  

other income expense 

  

in fiscal 2019 our gain on sale of investments was 12 million compared to 1 million and 3 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 respectively the gains were due to the sale of equity investments without determinable fair values 

  

in fiscal 2019 our investment income and other was 49 million compared to 48 million and 31 million in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 respectively the increases were primarily due to progressively increasing interest rates in the us as well as an increase in cash and investments throughout the year in fiscal 2018 

  

interest expense remained relatively flat at 73 million 75 million and 72 million in fiscal 2019 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 respectively refer to note 5 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income tax expense 

  

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform or “tax act” which among other things lowered the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 in addition the tax act imposed a onetime deemed repatriation tax on net unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax which is payable over a period of eight years in response to the tax act the securities and exchange commission staff issued a staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” that provided guidance on accounting for the impact of the tax act sab 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts while the accounting impact of the tax act was still under analysis not to extend beyond the measurement period of one year from the enactment of the tax act 

in fiscal 2018 we recorded provisional tax expense of 283 million related to the tax act the 283 million included a 209 million charge associated with the deemed repatriation tax and a 74 million charge primarily related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate during fiscal 2019 we finalized our calculations under sab 118 and recorded a 20 million reduction in the deemed repatriation tax and a 3 million reduction in the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities refer to note 11 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income tax expense decreased to 424 million in fiscal 2019 compared to 818 million in fiscal 2018 primarily as a result of the 283 million of tax expense associated with the tax act recorded in the prior year and the lower us statutory tax rate in the current year partially offset by the resolution of discrete tax matters in the prior year our effective income tax rate “etr” for fiscal 2019 was 224 compared to a rate of 450 in fiscal 2018 the decrease in the etr was primarily due to the impact of the tax act recorded in the prior year and the lower us statutory tax rate in the current year partially offset by the resolution of discrete tax matters in the prior year 

income tax expense increased to 818 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 609 million in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of the 283 million of tax expense associated with the tax act partially offset by the impacts from the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation the lower blended us statutory tax rate of 337 and a higher mix of pretax income from foreign operations in fiscal 2018 our etr for fiscal 2018 was 450 compared to a rate of 335 in fiscal 2017 the increase in the etr was primarily due to the impact of the tax act partially offset by the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation and a higher mix of pretax income from foreign operations in fiscal 2018 

discontinued operations 

  

discontinued operations reflect prior year activity within our international segment gain from discontinued operations net of tax in fiscal 2018 was 1 million primarily related to the proceeds attributed to a noncompete clause from the sale of best buy europe to carphone warehouse plc gain from discontinued operations net of tax in fiscal 2017 was 21 million primarily related to the sale of the remaining five star property assets that were held for sale as of january 30 2016

nongaap operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 35 million compared to fiscal 2018 primarily driven by strong revenue performance in both our domestic and international segments in nearly all product categories and decreases in sga primarily due to cost reductions and the absence of the extra week in fiscal 2019 the increase in nongaap operating income resulted in a yearoveryear increase in nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 which also benefited from a lower weightedaverage diluted share count and a lower tax rate 

nongaap operating income for fiscal 2018 increased 220 million compared to fiscal 2017 and nongaap operating income as a percent of revenue increased to 46 the increase was driven primarily by strong revenue performance in both our domestic and international segments in nearly all product categories and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018 offset by increases in sga primarily due to higher incentive compensation for store and corporate employees the increase in nongaap operating income resulted in a yearoveryear increase in nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

liquidity and capital resources 

summary 

we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements depend on key variables including the level of investment required to support our business strategies the performance of our business capital expenditures credit facilities shortterm borrowing arrangements and working capital management capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which to a large extent we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy 

the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at february 2 2019 and february 3 2018  in millions 



the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments in fiscal 2019 was primarily due to share repurchases investments in capital expenditures the acquisition of greatcall and dividends paid partially offset by cash generated from operations 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions 



operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018  was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and payments and increased earnings this was partially offset by higher incentive compensation payments including payouts related to prioryear performance timing of receivables collections and income tax payments 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchasing and payments and advertising payments during fiscal 2018 we purchased greater amounts of inventory with shorter payment terms than in fiscal 2017 causing more payments to be made prior to fiscal yearend this was partially offset by the timing of receivable collections and income tax payments 

investing activities 

the increase in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018  was primarily due to a net decrease in investment purchases in fiscal 2019 partially offset by the acquisition of greatcall 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily due to an increase in capital spending to support our strategic growth initiatives and cash received in fiscal 2017 for the five star asset heldforsale this was partially offset by a decrease in the net investment in shortterm investments during fiscal 2018 

financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018  was primarily due to a decrease in shares repurchased as we reached our 35 billion twoyear share repurchase plan announced on march 1 2018 this was partially offset by a decrease in the volume of option exercises and an increase in our regular quarterly dividend rate from 034 per share in fiscal 2018 to 045 per share in fiscal 2019 

the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily due to increased share repurchases driven by an increase in our share price and the number of shares repurchased and an increase in our regular quarterly dividend rate from 028 per share in fiscal 2017 to 034 per share in fiscal 2018 these increases were partially offset by the repayment of our 2016 notes due march 15 2016 in fiscal 2017 and a special dividend payment in fiscal 2017 

sources of liquidity 

funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures share repurchases dividends and strategic initiatives including business combinations however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to limit our spending there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing if necessary on favorable terms 

on april 17 2018 we entered into a new 125 billion fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility the fiveyear facility agreement with a syndicate of banks that expires in april 2023 the fiveyear facility agreement replaced the previous 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was originally scheduled to expire in june 2021 but was 

terminated on april 17 2018 at february 2 2019 and february 3 2018 we had no borrowings outstanding under these agreements refer to note 6 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our credit facility 

our ability to access our revolving credit facility under the fiveyear facility agreement is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the facility including financial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios at february 2 2019  we were compliant with all such financial covenants if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt it would likely constitute an event of default under our facilities as well 

our credit ratings and outlook at march 26 2019  are summarized below in fiscal 2019 moodys upgraded its outlook from stable to positive and fitch upgraded its ratings from bbb to bbb and changed its outlook from positive to stable standard  poors ratings remained unchanged from the prior year 



credit rating agencies review their ratings of our company periodically and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur they could impact among other things interest costs for certain of our credit facilities our future borrowing costs access to capital markets vendor financing terms and future newstore leasing costs 

restricted cash 

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for workers compensation and general liability insurance claims restricted cash and cash equivalents related to our continuing operations which are included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets remained relatively flat at 204 million  and 199 million  at february 2 2019  and february 3 2018  respectively 

capital expenditures 

our capital expenditures typically include investments in our stores distribution capabilities and information technology enhancements including ecommerce during fiscal 2019 we invested 819 million in property and equipment primarily related to upgrading our ecommerce and information technology systems and storerelated projects 

the following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions 



 

debt and capital 

as of february 2 2019 we had 650 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2021 the 2021 notes and 500 million principal amount of notes due october 1 2028 the 2028 notes outstanding refer to note 6 debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our 2021 notes and 2028 notes 

share repurchases and dividends 

we repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors board our longterm capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investmentgrade credit metrics 

on february 23 2019 our board authorized a new 30 billion  share repurchase program that superseded the previous 50 billion  authorization from february 2017 which had 15 billion  remaining as of february 2 2019  there is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the february 2019 authorization between the end of fiscal 2019 and march 26 2019  we repurchased an incremental 09 million  shares of our common stock at a cost of 62 million    repurchased shares are retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares 

the following table presents our share repurchase history for each of the past three fiscal years in millions except per share amounts 



in fiscal 2004 our board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on common stock a quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter the payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions the following table presents our dividend activity for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions except per share amounts 



 

dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2019 increased from fiscal 2018 due to an increase in the regular quarterly dividend per share from 034 in fiscal 2018 to 045 in fiscal 2019 dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2018 decreased from fiscal 2017 primarily due to the absence of a special cash dividend in fiscal 2018 partially offset by an increase in the regular quarterly dividend per share from 028 in fiscal 2017 to 034 in fiscal 2018 

on february 23 2019 our board authorized an 11 increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 050 per share 

other financial measures 

our current ratio calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities was 12  as of february 2 2019 compared to 13  as of february 3 2018  the lower current ratio in fiscal 2019 was driven by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily from share repurchases investments in capital expenditures and the acquisition of greatcall partially offset by a decrease in the current portion of longterm debt related to the repayment of our 500 million principal amount of notes due august 2018 which were included in the current portion of longterm debt at february 3 2018  

our debt to earnings ratio calculated as total debt including current portion divided by net earnings from continuing operations was 09 as of february 2 2019  compared to 14 as of february 3 2018  primarily due to higher earnings in the current year driven by a decrease in tax expense associated with the tax act 

offbalancesheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

other than operating leases we do not have any offbalancesheet arrangements a summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the contractual obligations table below additional information regarding our operating leases is 

available in item 2 properties  and note 10 leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations as of february 2 2019 with payments due by period  in millions 



note for additional information refer to note 6 debt  note 10 leases  note 11 income taxes  and note 13 contingencies and commitments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

 

additionally we have 125 billion  in undrawn capacity on our credit facility at february 2 2019  which if drawn upon would be included as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k other than our adoption of asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results these estimates require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments and generally incorporate significant uncertainty 

inventory markdown 

description 

our merchandise inventories were 54 billion at february 2 2019  we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected recovery rates due to factors such as product type and condition forecasted consumer demand product lifecycles the promotional environment vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition we also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value such as direct vendor allowances and selling costs 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our markdown adjustment at february 2 2019  would have affected net earnings by approximately 11 million in fiscal 2019  

vendor allowances 

description 

we receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements primarily in the form of purchasesbased or salesbased volumes and for product advertising and placement in our stores we recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated inventory is sold if the funds are not specifically related to purchase or sales volumes the funds are recognized ratably over the performance period as the product promotion or placement is completed funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendors products are recorded as an offset to the related expense when incurred 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

due to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or deferred as an offset to inventory these estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors including 1 proper classification of the type of funding received and 2 the methodology to estimate the portion of purchasesbased funding that should be recognized in cost of sales which considers factors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sellthrough of inventory 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our vendor funding deferral at february 2 2019  would have affected net earnings by approximately 28 million in fiscal 2019  

property and equipment impairments 

description 

property and equipment assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating property and equipment assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value 

we evaluate locations for triggering events on a quarterly basis for store locations our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is negative store operating income for the most recent 12month period we also monitor other factors when evaluating store locations for impairment including significant changes in the manner of use or expected life of the assets or significant changes in our business strategies 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred our impairment loss calculations require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows 

including estimated sales margin and expenses as well as considering lease changes and growth rates we also apply judgment in forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our nonrestructuring property and equipment impairments would have affected net earnings by approximately 1 million in fiscal 2019

our income tax returns are periodically audited by us federal state and local and foreign tax authorities tax authorities audit our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we may record a liability for such exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors such as changes in tax law interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

gift card breakage 

description 

we sell best buy gift cards to our customers in our retail stores online and through select third parties our gift cards do not expire we recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer we also recognize revenue for the portion of gift card values that is not expected to be redeemed breakage we estimate breakage based on historical patterns and other factors such as laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction we recognize breakage revenue using a method that is consistent with customer redemption patterns typically over 90  of gift card redemptions and therefore recognition of over 90 of gift card breakage revenue occur within one year of issuance 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

there is judgment in assessing 1 the level at which we group gift cards for analysis of breakage rates 2 redemption patterns and 3 the ultimate value of gift cards which we do not expect to be redeemed 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our cumulative estimated gift card breakage rate at february 2 2019  would have affected net earnings by approximately 51 million in fiscal 2019  

service revenue 

description 

we sell customers support plans as part of a bundled service offer which may include items such as technical support extended warranty antivirus software and onetime service repairs we allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative fair value for technical support membership contracts we typically recognize revenue over time on a usage basis an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term this method is based on historical utilization patterns 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

there is judgment in 1 determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts and 2 measuring the relative standalone selling price for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only bundled and sold to customers with other performance obligations or alternatively using a costplus margin approach and 3 assessing the pattern of delivery across multiple portfolios of customers including estimating current and future usage patterns when insufficient history of usage is available we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of february 2 2019  would have affected net earnings by approximately 12 million in fiscal 2019  

goodwill 

description 

goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its book value fair value reflects the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an armslength transaction 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

determining fair value of a reporting unit is complex and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows and other market information such as trading multiples cash flow analysis requires judgments regarding many factors such as revenue growth rates expenses and capital expenditures market information requires judgmental selection of relevant market comparables we estimate that the fair value of our domestic reporting unit significantly exceeds carrying value as our acquisition of greatcall occurred recently we estimate the fair value of the greatcall reporting unit approximates its fair value there is greater uncertainty surrounding the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the greatcall reporting unit and therefore a greater risk of goodwill impairment in future periods 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in the fair value of the greatcall reporting unit at february 2 2019 would not have a material affect on our net earnings

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in shortterm market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense our cash and shortterm investments generate interest income that will vary based on changes in shortterm interest rates in addition we have swapped our fixedrate debt to floatingrate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with shortterm interest rates refer to note 5 derivative instruments  and note 6 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our interest rate swaps 

as of february 2 2019 we had 20 billion  of cash and cash equivalents and  12 billion  of debt that has been swapped to floating rate therefore we had net cash and cash equivalents of 08 billion  generating income that is exposed to interest rate changes as of february 2 2019 a 50basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 4 million  reduction in net interest expense and conversely a 50basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 4 million  increase in net interest expense 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international segment operations on a limited basis we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our canadian operations our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows as well as net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments which generally have terms of up to 12 months refer to note 5 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these instruments 

the strengthening of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar and mexican peso compared to the prioryear period had a negative overall impact on our revenue as these currencies translated into fewer us dollars foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue in fiscal 2019  of approximately 68 million and a net unfavorable impact on earnings of approximately 4 million  in fiscal 2018 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net favorable impact on our revenue of approximately 85 million and a net favorable impact on earnings of approximately 4 million

international segment 

our canada and mexico store operations are similar to those in our domestic segment 

merchandise and services 

our domestic and international segments have offerings in six revenue categories consumer electronics computing and mobile phones entertainment appliances services and other the key components of each revenue category are as follows 

 

distribution 

domestic segment 

us best buy online merchandise sales are typically either picked up at us best buy stores or delivered directly to customers from a distribution center or retail store our shipfromstore capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers located throughout the us in order to meet release dates for certain products merchandise may be shipped directly to our stores from suppliers 

international segment 

our canada and mexico distribution model is similar to our domestic segment model 

suppliers and inventory 

our domestic and international segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers in fiscal 2018 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70 of the merchandise we purchased with five suppliers – apple samsung hewlettpackard sony and lenovo – representing approximately 56 of total merchandise purchased we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that secure any of the key terms of our arrangements 

we carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible key elements to our inventory management process include the following continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products 

we also have a global sourcing operation to design develop test and contractmanufacture our exclusive brand products 

store development 

we had approximately 1200 largeformat and 300 smallformat stores at the end of fiscal 2018 throughout our domestic and international segments our stores are a vital component of our multichannel strategy and we believe they are an important competitive advantage we have the ability to ship from all of our best buy stores in the us and all of our largeformat stores in canada customers may also elect to pick up orders initiated online in any of our stores beginning in 2013 we opened vendor storewithinastore concepts to allow closer vendor partnership and a higher quality customer experience in fiscal 2019 and beyond we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our store space renegotiate leases and selectively open or close locations to support our operations as evidenced by our recent announcement to close all of our remaining best buy mobile standalone stores in the us 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for tables reconciling our domestic and international segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years

competition 

our competitors are primarily multichannel retailers internetbased businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers we believe our ability to deliver a highquality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price in addition in the us onlineonly operators are not generally required to collect sales taxes in certain states we believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are reevaluated at both the state and federal levels we carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities in addition we have a pricematching policy in the us that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators in order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships we believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people integrated online and retail assets broad product assortment strong vendor relationships range of focused service and support offerings distinct store formats brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage

 item 1a risk factors 

described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate each of the following risk factors should carefully be considered in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10k and in our other public disclosures the risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial all forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below 

we face strong competition from multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers that offer their products and services directly to customers which directly affects our revenue and profitability 

the retail sector is highly competitive price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology the ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers that offer products directly to consumers some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us have greater brand recognition and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time they may also be able to secure better terms from vendors and devote more resources to technology fulfillment and marketing competition may also result from new entrants in the markets we serve offering products andor services that compete with us 

the retail sector continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications and some onlineonly businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not generally required to collect sales taxes in certain us states which can negatively impact the ability of multichannel retailers to be price competitive on a taxincluded basis online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency puts pressure on our margins 

as these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability 

many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences 

in general consumer electronics product life cycles which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence have become shorter and less predictable this is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change and this adds to the unpredictability of our business these factors affect us in a number of ways for example 

 

the effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and prices if we fail to interpret predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include 

 

these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors in fiscal 2018 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70 of the merchandise we purchased 77 in fiscal 2017 with 5 suppliers – apple samsung hewlettpackard sony and lenovo – representing approximately 56 of total merchandise purchased 53 in fiscal 2017 we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties to varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages — for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers — to our commercial disadvantage the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships 

we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business for example if carriers change the structure of customer contracts customer upgrade terms customer qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenue and profitability in addition our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels carriers may decide to cease allowing us to offer their contracts or certain categories of their contracts focus their marketing efforts on alternative 

channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms each of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

we have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards of quality and safety can be difficult especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us political or financial instability merchandise quality issues product safety concerns crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs work stoppages port delays foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control vendors may also fail to invest adequately in design production or distribution facilities may reduce their customer incentives advertising and promotional activities or change their pricing policies these and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

if the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches in laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation recalls of products particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

we offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings including consultation design delivery installation setup protection plans repair technical support and educational classes designing marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

 

in addition as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services if for these or other reasons we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers’ expectations in the execution of these services our reputation revenue and profitability could be adversely affected 

macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results 

to varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending as a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example 

 

real gdp growth consumer confidence inflation employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and 

food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers demand for the products and services that we offer our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors 

interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain including inbound deliveries from our vendors may adversely affect our business 

our supply chain is a critical part of our operations particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online we depend on our vendors ability to deliver products to us at the right location right time and in the right quantities we also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network the factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include 

 

it is important that we be able to maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting demands any disruption to or inefficiency in our supply chain network could damage our revenue and profitability the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business the continuing growth of ecommerce increases our exposure to these risks if we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability 

if we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our operations and profitability may be harmed changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability 

our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores service centers distribution centers field and corporate offices our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce the turnover rate in the retail sector is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities in addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations 

our strategy to expand into new products services and technologies brings new business financial and regulatory risks 

as we introduce new products and services using new technologies and applications we may have limited experience in these newer market segments and our customers may not like our new value propositions these offerings may present new and difficult technology challenges and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues in addition this expansion increases the complexity of our business and places significant strain on our management personnel operations systems technical performance financial resources and internal financial and regulatory control and reporting functions in addition new initiatives we test through trials and pilots may not scale or grow effectively or as we expected which could limit our growth and negatively affect our operating results they may also involve significant laws or regulations that are beyond our current expertise 

demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition 

we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation we believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success operational factors such as for example failure to deliver high quality services uncompetitive pricing failure to meet delivery promises or business interruptions could damage our reputation 

external factors such as negative public remarks or accusations could also be damaging the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in among other things declines in customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability 

failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 

effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multichannel strategy failure to identify and lease suitable locations for our stores and other facilities could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability most of our properties are subject to longterm leases as such it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our longterm real estate strategy such factors include for example 

 

if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example 

 

these consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity 

for leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant in addition to rent we are still responsible for taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant 

failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors because of for example our differential service offerings or levels of customer service as discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce costs and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives 

constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 

we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able 

to pursue business opportunities the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders these factors could have a material adverse effect on our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 

our credit ratings and outlooks at march 29 2018  are summarized below in fiscal 2018 fitch ratings limited affirmed its longterm credit rating of bbb and changed its outlook from stable to positive in fiscal 2019 standard  poors rating services upgraded its longterm credit rating of bbb to bbb and changed its outlook from positive to stable and moodys investors service inc affirmed its longterm credit rating of baa1 with a stable outlook 



any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 

we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

  

approximately onethird of our revenue and more than onehalf of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico in addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters changes in consumer demand economic factors product sourcing issues failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations as a result of these factors there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected 

failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business 

we may decide to enter into new joint ventures partnerships alliances or acquisitions with third parties collectively new ventures assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors including for example 

 

if new ventures are unsuccessful our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired new ventures may also divert our financial resources and managements attention from other important areas of our business 

failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach of the privacy or security of our customer employee vendor or company information could expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage as well as litigation and enforcement actions 

our business involves the collection use and storage of customer information including payment card information as well as confidential information regarding our employees vendors and other company information we also share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties as well as use thirdparty technology and systems which transmit customer information for a variety of activities while we take significant steps to protect this information third party criminal activity such as cyberattacks lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our privacy and security measures and unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate such attacks or promptly and effectively respond to them any compromise of our customer information or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationships with our customers and partners which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and claims 

sensitive customer data may also be present on customerowned devices entrusted to us for service and repair vulnerable code on products sold or serviced including our exclusive brands may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security our efforts to protect against such compromises and ensure appropriate handling of customer data on devices we manufacture sell and service may not be effective resulting in potential liability and damage to our customer relationships 

increasing costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially additionally the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks including the use of cashless payments in addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk 

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems and those of our information technology vendors we rely heavily on these information technology systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing services fulfillment staff planning and deployment financial management reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information 

our information technology systems and those of our partners are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses worms other malicious computer programs denialofservice attacks security breaches through cyberattacks and other malicious actions catastrophic events such as fires tornadoes earthquakes and hurricanes and usage errors by our employees the failure or interruption of these information systems data centers or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation 

we also utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications if we do not continually invest in securing these systems against attacks or fail to effectively upgrade and maintain our hardware software network and system infrastructure and improve the efficiency and resiliency of our systems it could cause system interruptions and delays disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels malicious attacks other technical difficulties or events outside of our control such as natural disasters power or telecommunications failures or loss of critical data could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders for products or services which could cause us to forgo material revenues incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation 

catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results 

the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance such events may be caused by for example 

• natural disasters or extreme weather events 

 

such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network they can also affect our information systems resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results 

sales of our exclusive brands products which include insignia modal dynex platinum and rocketfish branded products represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeast asia this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

 

maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brand products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them 

we are subject to certain statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are 



 

regulatory activity focused on the retail sector has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance additionally defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters 

changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model 

as an employer of approximately 125000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including for example 

 

changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation our ability to continue operations and our profitability 

economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs 

  

we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low or nointerest financing on qualifying purchases we believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases approximately 24 of our fiscal 2018 revenue was transacted using one of the companys branded cards in addition we earn profitshare income from our banking partners based on the performance of the programs the income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors including the volume and value of transactions the terms of promotional financing offers bad debt rates interest rates the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs 

  

we utilize thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our business operations 

  

we engage key thirdparty business partners to support various functions of our business including but not limited to information technology web hosting and cloudbased services human resource operations customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards gift cards customer warranty delivery and installation technical support transportation and insurance programs any material disruption in our relationship with key thirdparty business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods 

our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above as well as to risks associated with the legislative judicial regulatory political economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

  

we operate retail locations in canada and mexico in addition we have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries including bermuda china hong kong luxembourg the republic of mauritius turks and caicos and the uk during fiscal 2018 our international segments operations generated 8 of our revenue in general the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations in addition our international operations also expose us to other risks including those related to for example 

   

these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead us to incur material impairments and other exit costs 

failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price 

  

we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forwardlooking information for future periods although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential shareholders such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided we may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates a significant portion of our expenses and investments are fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rates may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide if our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results unless otherwise noted transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude our mda is presented in the following sections 

 

our mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we are a leading provider of technology products services and solutions we offer these products and services to customers who visit our stores engage with geek squad agents or use our websites or mobile applications we have operations in the us canada and mexico we operate two reportable segments domestic and international the domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states districts and territories of the us the international segment is comprised of all operations in canada and mexico 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january fiscal 2018 included 53 weeks with the additional week included in the fourth quarter fiscal 2017 and 2016 each included 52 weeks our business like that of many retailers is seasonal a higher proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico holiday 

throughout this mda we refer to comparable sales our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales 

channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year relocated stores as well as remodeled expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition the calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our international segment only and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018 the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods 

the canadian brand consolidation which included the permanent closure of 66 future shop stores the conversion of 65 future shop stores to best buy stores and the elimination of the future shop website had a material impact on a yearoveryear basis on the remaining canadian retail stores and the website as such from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017 all canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the international segment no longer had a comparable metric therefore consolidated comparable sales equaled the domestic segment comparable sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we resumed reporting international comparable sales as revenue in the international segment was once again deemed to be comparable and as such consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of domestic and international comparable sales however we have not provided international comparable sales for fiscal 2017 as the calculation would only include comparable revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and may be misleading in future periods when used for comparison purposes 

nongaap financial measures 

this mda includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap as well as certain adjusted or nongaap financial measures such as constant currency nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate nongaap net earnings from continuing operations nongaap diluted earnings per share eps from continuing operations and nongaap debt to earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and rent ebitdar ratio we believe that nongaap financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance for these reasons our internal management reporting also includes nongaap financial measures generally our nongaap financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges goodwill impairments and gains or losses on investments in addition certain other items may be excluded from nongaap financial measures when we believe this provides greater clarity to management and our investors these nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not superior to or as a substitute for gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nongaap financial measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment’s operating results from local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes we also use the term constant currency which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates we believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency can provide useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates and our inability to report comparable store sales for the international segment from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of the canadian brand consolidation 

beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we no longer exclude nonrestructuring property and equipment impairment charges from our nongaap financial metrics when we began to execute our renew blue transformation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we adopted a change to nongaap reporting to exclude nonrestructuring property and equipment impairment charges from our nongaap results from that point through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we believed that reporting nongaap results that excluded these charges provided a supplemental view of our ongoing performance that was useful and relevant to our investors now that renew blue has ended and best buy 2020 building the new blue has officially launched we believe it is no longer necessary to adjust for nonrestructuring property and equipment impairments in our nongaap reporting we believe that future such impairments will predominantly be immaterial and incurred in the ordinary scope of ongoing operations accordingly commencing in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we no longer adjust for nonrestructuring property and equipment impairments impacted prior period nongaap financial measures have been recast to conform with this presentation 

refer to the  nongaap financial measures  section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted the nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate nongaap net earnings from continuing operations and nongaap diluted eps from continuing operations in the presented periods 

refer to the  other financial measures  section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted the nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio management believes this ratio is an important indicator of our creditworthiness furthermore we believe that our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio is important for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our longterm debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth we also believe our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to that of retailers who own rather than lease their stores our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity our capital structure our desire to own or to lease the location the owner’s desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders

additional consolidated results 

  

other income expense 

  

in fiscal 2018 our gain on sale of investments was 1 million compared to 3 million and 2 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 respectively these gains were due to the sale of costbased investments 

  

in fiscal 2018 our investment income and other was 48 million compared to 31 million and 13 million in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 respectively the increases were primarily due to higher interest rates in the us as well as an increase in investments throughout the year in fiscal 2018 

  

interest expense was 75 million 72 million and 80 million in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively interest expense remained relatively flat in fiscal 2018 but decreased in fiscal 2017 primarily due to a lower debt balance for a majority of the year caused by the march 2016 payment of our 350 million principal amount notes refer to note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income tax expense 

  

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform or “tax act” which among other things lowered the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 consequently we applied a blended us statutory federal income tax rate of 337  for fiscal 2018 in addition the tax act imposed a onetime deemed repatriation tax on net unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax which is payable over a period of eight years in response to the tax act the securities and exchange commission “sec” staff issued a staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” that provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the tax act sab 118 allows companies to record provisional amounts while the accounting impact of the tax act is still under analysis not to extend beyond the measurement period of one year from the enactment of the tax act 

as a result of the tax act we recorded provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 of 283 million the 283 million included a 209 million charge associated with the deemed repatriation tax and a 74 million charge primarily related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate the actual impact of the tax act may differ materially from our provisional amounts due to further refinement of our calculations as allowed by sab 118 changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made or actions we may take as a result of the tax act the provisional amounts will be finalized within the oneyear measurement period as we gather and analyze the additional documentation necessary for the calculations refer to note 10 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income tax expense increased to 818 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 609 million in fiscal 2017 primarily as a result of the 283 million of tax expense associated with the tax act partially offset by the impacts from the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation the lower blended us statutory tax rate of 337 and a higher mix of pretax income from foreign operations in the current year our effective income tax rate “etr” for fiscal 2018 was 450 compared to a rate of 335 in fiscal 2017 the increase in the etr was primarily due to the impact of the tax act partially offset by the recognition of excess tax benefits related to stockbased compensation and a higher mix of pretax income from foreign operations in the current year 

income tax expense increased to 609 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 503 million in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in pretax earnings partially offset by a higher mix of pretax income from foreign operations and the resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal 2017 our etr for fiscal 2017 was 335 compared to a rate of 384 in fiscal 2016 the decrease in the etr was primarily due to a higher mix of pretax income from foreign operations and the resolution of certain tax matters in fiscal 2017 

our consolidated etr is impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as our foreign earnings are generally taxed at a lower statutory rate than the current 337 us statutory rate changes in the proportion of our consolidated taxable earnings originating in foreign jurisdictions impact our consolidated effective rate with the lower us statutory tax rate enacted by the tax act we expect our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate to be lower 

  

discontinued operations 

  

discontinued operations reflect activity within our international segment gain from discontinued operations in fiscal 2018 was 1 million primarily related to the proceeds attributed to a noncompete clause from the sale of best buy europe to carphone warehouse plc gain from discontinued operations in fiscal 2017 of 21 million was primarily related to the sale of the remaining five star property assets that were held for sale as of january 30 2016 the 90 million gain from discontinued operations in fiscal 2016 was primarily related to the gain recognized on the sale of five star

nongaap operating income for fiscal 2018 increased 220 million compared to fiscal 2017 and nongaap operating income as a percent of revenue increased to 46 the increase was driven primarily by strong revenue performance in both our domestic and international segments in nearly all product categories and the impact of the extra week offset by increases in sga primarily due to higher incentive compensation for store and corporate employees the increase in nongaap operating income resulted in a yearoveryear increase in nongaap net earnings from continuing operations and nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 

nongaap operating income for fiscal 2017 increased 228 million compared to fiscal 2016 and nongaap operating income as a percent of revenue increased to 44 the increase was driven by the increased consolidated gross profit rate and continued sga cost reductions in both segments primarily due to the realization of our renew blue phase 2 cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management the increase in nongaap operating income resulted in a yearoveryear increase in nongaap net earnings from continuing operations and nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

summary 

we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements depend on key variables including the level of investment required to support our business strategies the performance of our business capital expenditures credit facilities and shortterm borrowing arrangements and working capital management capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which to a large extent we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our best buy 2020 building the new blue strategy 

the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at february 3 2018 and january 28 2017  in millions 



existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as well as cash generated from operations were sufficient to fund share repurchases capital expenditures and dividends in fiscal 2018 without the need to utilize our credit facilities or other debt arrangements 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions 



 

operating activities 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchasing and payments and advertising payments during fiscal 2018 we purchased greater amounts of inventory with shorter payment terms than in the prior year causing more payments to be made prior to fiscal yearend this was partially offset by the timing of receivable collections and income tax payments 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchasing and payments and increased earnings during fiscal 2017 we purchased and paid for inventory later in the holiday season than in the prior year positively impacting operating cash flows this was partially offset by the timing of collection of receivables 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily due to an increase in capital spending to support our strategic growth initiatives and cash received in fiscal 2017 for the five star asset heldforsale this was partially offset by a decrease in the net investment in shortterm investments during fiscal 2018 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to an increase in the net investment in shortterm investments in fiscal 2017 

financing activities 

the increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  was primarily due to increased share repurchases driven by an increase in our share price and the number of shares repurchased and an increase in our regular quarterly dividend rate from 028 per share in fiscal 2017 to 034 per share in fiscal 2018 these increases were partially offset by the repayment of our 2016 notes due march 15 2016 the 2016 notes in fiscal 2017 and a special dividend payment in fiscal 2017 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to a decline in the number of shares repurchased which was substantially offset by the repayment of our 350 million principal amount of our 2016 notes 

sources of liquidity 

funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures strategic initiatives share repurchases and dividends however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to limit our spending there can be no assurance that we will continue to 

generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing if necessary on favorable terms 

we have a 125 billion fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility the fiveyear facility agreement with a syndicate of banks that expires in june 2021 at february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 we had no borrowings outstanding under the fiveyear facility agreement refer to note 5 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our credit facility 

our ability to access our revolving credit facility under the fiveyear facility agreement is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the facility including financial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios at february 3 2018  we were in compliance with all such financial covenants if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt it would likely constitute an event of default under our facilities as well 

an interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense to fixed charges our interest coverage ratio calculated as reported in exhibit no 121 of this annual report on form 10k was 686  and 697  in fiscal 2018  and fiscal 2017  respectively

credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur they could impact among other things interest costs for certain of our credit facilities our future borrowing costs access to capital markets vendor financing terms and future newstore leasing costs

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for general liability insurance and workers compensation insurance restricted cash and cash equivalents related to our continuing operations which are included in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets remained relatively flat at 199 million  and 193 million  at february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  respectively

in fiscal 2004 our board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on common stock a quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter the payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions the following table presents our dividend activity for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions except per share amounts 



 

dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2018 decreased from fiscal 2017 primarily due to the absence of a special cash dividend in the current year partially offset by an increase in the regular quarterly dividend per share from 028 in fiscal 2017 to 034 in fiscal 2018 dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2017 were relatively unchanged from fiscal 2016 noting that the quarterly dividend per share increased from 023 in fiscal 2016 to 028 in fiscal 2017 the increase in the regular dividend rate was 

substantially offset by fewer common shares due to a return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and a smaller special dividend 

on march 1 2018 we announced a 32 increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 045 per share 

other financial measures 

our current ratio calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities was 13 as of february 3 2018 compared to 15 as of january 28 2017 the lower current ratio in fiscal 2018 was driven by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents primarily from increased share repurchases and an increase in the current portion of longterm debt related to our 2018 notes 

our debt to earnings ratio was 14  as of february 3 2018  compared to 11  as of january 28 2017  primarily due to lower earnings in the current year driven by an increase in tax expense associated with the tax act our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio remained unchanged at 16  as of february 3 2018  and january 28 2017  respectively 

our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio is calculated as follows 



the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio which excludes capitalized operating lease obligations from debt in the numerator of the calculation and does not adjust net earnings in the denominator of the calculation 

the following table presents a reconciliation of our debt to net earnings ratio to our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio for continuing operations  in millions 



 

offbalancesheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

other than operating leases we do not have any offbalancesheet financing a summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the contractual obligations table below additional information regarding our operating leases is available in item 2 properties  and note 8 leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations as of february 3 2018 with payments due by period  in millions 



note for additional information refer to note 5 debt  note 8 leases  note 10 income taxes  and note 12 contingencies and commitments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

 

additionally we have 125 billion  in undrawn capacity on our credit facility at february 3 2018  which if drawn upon would be included as shortterm debt on our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results these estimates require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 

except where noted we have not made any material changes during the past three fiscal years nor do we believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material future change to the accounting methodologies for the areas described below 

inventory 

description 

our merchandise inventories were 52 billion at february 3 2018 we value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding factors such as the products to include in our analysis the product’s condition forecasted consumer demand the promotional environment the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition and technological obsolescence we also apply judgment in the assumptions about net realizable value including direct vendor allowances and selling and supply chain costs 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our markdown adjustment at february 3 2018 would have affected net earnings by approximately 8 million in fiscal 2018 

vendor allowances 

description 

we receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements principally as a result of purchase volumes sales price protections or the promotion of a vendor’s product in our stores or through various advertising mediums for the most part these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs that we incur to sell the vendor’s products therefore we calculate and accrue for these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory as the amounts are mutually agreedupon with the vendor and recognize these funds as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold funds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendors products are recorded as an offset to the related expense 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

due to the quantity of and diverse nature of individual vendor agreements a deferral estimate is required for vendor allowances received on inventory purchases this estimate requires a detailed analysis of factors such as 1 product and vendor mix 2 the nature and period the negotiated funding relates to in order to determine the allowances to defer and 3 analysis and judgment regarding when the inventory is sold 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 changee in our vendor funding deferral at february 3 2018  would have affected net earnings by approximately 24 million in fiscal 2018  

property and equipment impairments 

description 

property and equipment assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating property and equipment assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value 

we evaluate locations for triggering events on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s asset carrying values may not be recoverable for store locations our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is negative operating income for the most recent 12month period we also monitor other factors when evaluating store locations for impairment including significant changes in the manner of use or expected life of the assets or significant changes in our business strategies 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred our impairment loss calculations require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows including estimated sales margin and expenses as well as estimating lease lives and growth rates we also apply judgment in forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our nonrestructuring property and equipment impairments would have affected net earnings by approximately 1 million in fiscal 2018 

tax contingencies 

description 

our income tax returns are periodically audited by us federal state and local and foreign tax authorities tax authorities audit our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we may record a liability for such exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors such as changes in tax law interpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction the magnitude and timing of certain transactions and capital spending 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 

tax reform 

description 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax act which significantly changes us tax law among other things the tax act lowered the us statutory tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 broadened the base to which us income tax applies imposed a onetime deemed repatriation tax on net unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries not previously subject to us income tax and effectively created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

the sec staff issued sab 118 that provides guidance on accounting for the impact of the tax act sab 118 allows companies to record provisional amounts to the extent that they are reasonably estimable and adjust them over time as more information becomes available not to extend beyond the measurement period of one year from the enactment of the tax act 

as a result of the tax act we recorded provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 of 283 million the 283 million included a 209 million charge associated with the deemed repatriation tax and a 74 million charge primarily related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable the ultimate impact of the tax act may differ materially from our provisional amounts due to further refinement of our calculations as allowed by sab 118 changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made or actions we may take as a result of the tax act the provisional amounts will be finalized within the oneyear measurement period as we gather and analyze the additional documentation necessary for the calculations refer to note 10 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

gift card breakage 

description 

we sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores through our websites and through select third parties a liability is initially established for the value of the gift card when it is sold we do not charge administrative fees on unused gift cards and our gift cards do not expire we recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer for unredeemed gift cards we recognize breakage when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is deemed remote and we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to a relevant jurisdiction we determine the breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns and record projected breakage 24 months after card issuance 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

there is inherent judgment in estimating gift card redemption patterns as they are susceptible to factors outside of our influence however we have extensive history of breakage patterns in general uncertainty reduces significantly within a short time frame as the majority of our gift card redemptions occur within the first year 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our cumulative gift card breakage estimate at february 3 2018 would have affected net earnings by approximately 37 million in fiscal 2018 

customer loyalty programs 

description 

we have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed with us or when using our cobranded credit cards points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases at our best buy branded stores the value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

there is inherent judgment in estimating the value of our customer loyalty programs as they are susceptible to factors outside of our influence particularly customer redemption activity however we have significant experience in estimating the amount and timing of redemptions of certificates based primarily on historical data 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our customer redemption rates at february 3 2018  would have affected net earnings by approximately 15 million in fiscal 2018  

service revenue 

description 

we sell customers support plans as part of a bundled service offer which may include items such as technical support extended warranty antivirus software and onetime service repairs we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative fair value revenue for our technical support plans is recognized over the contract term based on a straightline or usage basis 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our process for determining the fair value allocation of revenue to deliverables requires judgment as a portion of our deliverables require our best estimate of fair value for revenue recognized on a usage basis there is judgment inherent in our determination of the usage basis and related pattern of revenue these judgment areas are also subject to change based on changes to our service offerings including the types of support covered by the plan products covered by plans level of service required by customers contract length number of devices eligible for service and frequency and timing of customer support 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of february 3 2018 would have affected net earnings by approximately 10 million in fiscal 2018 

selfinsurance 

description 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to health workers compensation and general liability claims however we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain claims liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported when estimating our selfinsured liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and valuations provided by independent thirdparty actuaries 

judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate 

our selfinsured liabilities require us to apply judgment and make assumptions to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date these estimates include a variety of inputs including projected exposures actual versus expected results number of open claims frequency of claims severity of claims and historical loss development patterns of claims 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions 

a 10 change in our selfinsured liabilities as of february 3 2018 would have affected net earnings by approximately 9 million in fiscal 2018 

new accounting pronouncements   

for a description of new applicable accounting pronouncements see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in shortterm market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense our cash and shortterm investments generate interest income that will vary based on changes in shortterm interest rates in addition we have swapped all of our fixedrate debt to floatingrate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with shortterm interest rates refer to note 5 debt    and note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our interest rate swaps 

as of february 3 2018 we had 31 billion  of cash and shortterm investments and  12 billion  of debt that has been swapped to floating rate therefore we had net cash and shortterm investments of 20 billion  generating income that is exposed to interest rate changes as of february 3 2018 a 50 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 10 million  reduction in net interest expense and conversely a 50 basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would have led to an estimated 10 million  increase in net interest expense 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international segment operations on a limited basis we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our canadian operations our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows as well as net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments which generally have terms of up to 12 months refer to note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding these instruments 

the weakening of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar compared to the prioryear period had a positive overall impact on our revenue as these currencies translated into more us dollars exchange rate fluctuations in the us dollar compared to the mexican peso compared to the prioryear period had an immaterial impact in the current year we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net favorable impact on our revenue in fiscal 2018  of approximately 85 million and a net favorable impact on earnings of 4 million  in fiscal 2017 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately 76 million and a net favorable impact on earnings of 4 million

international segment 

our canada and mexico distribution model is similar to our domestic segment model 

suppliers and inventory

competition 

our competitors are primarily multichannel retailers internetbased businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers we believe our ability to deliver a high quality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage some of our competitors have low cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price in addition in the us onlineonly operators are exempt from collecting sales taxes in certain states we believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are reevaluated at both the state and federal levels we carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities in addition we have a pricematching policy in the us that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators in order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships we believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people integrated online and retail assets broad product assortment strong vendor relationships range of focused service and support offerings distinct store formats brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage

we face strong competition from multichannel retailers ecommerce businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers that offer their products and services directly to customers which directly affects our revenue and profitability 

the retail business is highly competitive price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology the ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers that offer products directly to consumers some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time the retail industry continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications and some onlineonly businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all us states which can negatively impact the ability of multichannel retailers to be price competitive on a taxincluded basis online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency puts pressure on our margins 

as these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability 

many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement product life cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences 

in general consumer electronics product life cycles which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence have become shorter and less predictable this is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change and this adds to the unpredictability of our business these factors affect us in a number of ways for example 

 

the effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and price if we fail to interpret predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include 

 

these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors in fiscal 2017 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 77 of the merchandise we purchased 75 in fiscal 2016 with 5 suppliers – apple samsung sony hewlettpackard and lg electronics – representing approximately 53 of total merchandise purchased 51 in fiscal 2016 we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties to varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships 

we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business for example if carriers change the structure of customer contracts customer upgrade terms customer qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenues and profitability in addition our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels carriers may decide to cease allowing us to offer their contracts or certain categories of their contracts focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms each of these factors could have a materially adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

we have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet our ability to find qualified vendors who can supply products in a timely and efficient manner that meet our standards of quality and safety can be difficult especially with respect 

to goods sourced from outside the us political or financial instability merchandise quality issues product safety concerns crossborder trade restrictions or tariffs work stoppages port delays foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other related issues could materially adversely affect our financial results 

product safety and quality concerns could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

if the products we sell fail to meet applicable safety standards or our customers expectations regarding safety and quality we could be exposed to increased legal risk and our reputation may be damaged failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product recalls could lead to breaches in laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation recalls of products particularly when combined with lack of available alternatives or our difficulty in sourcing sufficient volumes of replacement products could also have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

our focus on services as a strategic priority exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

we offer a full range of services that complement our product offerings including consultation design delivery installation setup protection plans repair technical support and educational classes designing marketing and executing these services is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

 

in addition as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services if for these or other reasons we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers’ expectations in the execution of these services our reputation revenue and profitability could be adversely affected 

macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results 

to varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending as a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example 

 

consumer confidence inflation employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers demand for the products and services that we offer our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors 

interruptions and other factors affecting our supply chain including inbound deliveries from our vendors may adversely affect our business 

our supply chain is a critical part of our operations particularly in light of recent industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast and free delivery when purchasing online we depend on our vendors ability to deliver 

products to us at the right location right time and in the right quantities we also depend on third parties for the operation of certain aspects of our supply chain network the factors that can adversely affect these aspects of our operations include 

 

the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business the continuing growth of ecommerce increases our exposure to these risks if we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability 

if we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our operations and profitability may be harmed changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability 

our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores service centers distribution centers field and corporate offices our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce the turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers availability of qualified personnel and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages we operate in a competitive labor market and there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have a material adverse effect on our profitability failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities in addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations 

demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition 

we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation we believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in among other things declines in customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity and vendor relationship issues all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability 

our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies 

we operate in a highlycompetitive and everchanging commercial environment our success is dependent on our ability to identify develop and execute appropriate strategies within this environment strategies that have proved successful in the past may not be successful in the future our current strategy includes continuous improvement of our business and the pursuit of new growth opportunities it is possible that our strategies may be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in the future it is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies or that they expose us to additional risks our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to develop and execute appropriate strategies the market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further information regarding our strategies 

failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 

effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our multichannel strategy most of our properties are subject to longterm leases as such it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence the success of our longterm real estate strategy such factors include for example 

 

if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example 

 

these consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity 

for leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant in addition to rent we are still responsible for the maintenance taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessor this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant 

failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors because of for example our differential service offerings or levels of customer service as discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce cost and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives 

our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms 

we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit and our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders these factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 

our credit ratings and outlooks at march 20 2017  are summarized below in fiscal 2017 standard  poors rating services upgraded its longterm credit rating from bb to bbb with a stable outlook moodys investors service inc affirmed its longterm credit rating of baa1 with a stable outlook and fitch ratings limited affirmed its longterm credit rating of bbb with a stable outlook 



any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 

we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

  

approximately onethird of our revenue and more than onehalf of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico in addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of competitive promotional activity and customer buying patterns which makes it difficult to forecast and react to these factors quickly unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters economic factors product sourcing issues failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations as a result of these factors there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results could be adversely affected 

failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business 

we may decide to enter into new joint ventures partnerships alliances or acquisitions with third parties collectively new ventures assessing the viability of new ventures is typically subject to significant uncertainty and the success of such new ventures can be adversely affected by many factors including for example 

 

if new ventures are unsuccessful our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired new ventures may also divert our financial resources and managements attention from other important areas of our business 

failure to protect or effectively respond to breach of the integrity security and confidentiality of our employee and customer data could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our employees or customers 

the use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state federal and international levels we are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information increasing costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff the costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially additionally the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other 

confidential information over public networks including the use of cashless payments while we take significant steps to protect this information lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties or failure to effectively respond to such compromises may undermine our security measures as a result unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may not prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationship with our employees which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and compensation claims in addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk 

catastrophic events could adversely affect our operating results 

the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance such events may be caused by for example 

 

such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results 

sales of our exclusive brands products which include insignia modal dynex init platinum and rocketfish branded products represent an important component of our product offerings and our revenue and profitability most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeastern asia this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them 

we are subject to certain statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are 

 

regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance additionally defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters 

changes to labor or employment laws or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model 

as an employer of approximately 125000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including for example 

 

changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation our ability to continue operations and our profitability 

economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs 

  

we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low or nointerest financing on qualifying purchases we believe our financing programs generate incremental revenue from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment or otherwise need access to financing in order to make purchases approximately 23 of our fiscal 2017 revenue was transacted using one of the companys branded cards in addition we earn profitshare income from our banking partners based on the performance of the programs the income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors including the volume and value of transactions the terms of promotional financing offers bad debt 

rates interest rates the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce customer purchases and our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs 

  

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems we rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing services fulfillment staff planning and deployment website offerings financial management reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate whether from internal or external factors or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business could significantly disrupt our business and cause for example higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation 

we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels malicious attacks or other technical difficulties could cause us to forgo material revenues incur material costs and adversely affect our reputation with consumers 

  

we utilize thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our business operations 

  

we engage key thirdparty business partners to support various functions of our business including but not limited to information technology web hosting and cloudbased services human resource operations customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards gift cards customer warranty technical support transportation and insurance programs any material disruption in our relationship with key thirdparty business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods 

our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above as well as to risks associated with the legislative judicial regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

  

we operate retail locations in canada and mexico in addition we have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries including bermuda china germany hong kong luxembourg the republic of mauritius turks and caicos and the uk during fiscal 2017 our international segments operations generated 8 of our revenue in general the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations in addition our international operations also expose us to other risks including those related to for example 

   

these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead to us incurring material impairments and other exit costs 

failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price 

  

we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forwardlooking information for future periods although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential stockholders such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided if our financial results for a particular period 

do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results unless otherwise noted transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude our mda is presented in the following sections 

 

our mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we are a leading provider of technology products services and solutions we offer these products and services to customers who visit our stores engage with geek squad agents or use our websites or mobile applications we have operations in the us canada and mexico we operate two reportable segments domestic and international the domestic segment is comprised of all operations within the us and its districts and territories the international segment is comprised of all operations outside the us and its territories 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest the end of january fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 each included 52 weeks noting that fiscal 2018 will include 53 weeks with the additional week included in the fourth quarter our business like that of many 

retailers is seasonal a higher proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico holiday 

throughout this mda we refer to comparable sales our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year relocated stores as well as remodeled expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition the calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our international segment only the canadian brand consolidation which included the permanent closure of 66 future shop stores the conversion of 65 future shop stores to best buy stores and the elimination of the future shop website had a material impact on a yearoveryear basis on the remaining canadian retail stores and the website as such from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017 all canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the international segment no longer had a comparable metric therefore consolidated comparable sales equaled the domestic segment comparable sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we resumed reporting international comparable sales as revenue in the international segment was once again deemed to be comparable and as such consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of domestic and international comparable sales however we have not provided international comparable sales for fiscal 2017 as the calculation would only include comparable revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and may be misleading in future periods when used for comparison purposes the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods 

nongaap financial measures 

this mda includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap as well as certain adjusted or nongaap financial measures such as constant currency nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate nongaap net earnings from continuing operations nongaap diluted earnings per share eps from continuing operations and nongaap debt to earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and rent ebitdar ratio we believe that nongaap financial measures when reviewed in conjunction with gaap financial measures can provide more information to assist investors in evaluating current period performance and in assessing future performance for these reasons our internal management reporting also includes nongaap measures generally our nongaap measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges goodwill impairments nonrestructuring asset impairments and gains or losses on investments in addition certain other items may be excluded from nongaap financial measures when we believe this provides greater clarity to management and our investors these nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not superior to or as a substitute for gaap financial measures we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nongaap measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment’s operating results from local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes we also use the term constant currency which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts we calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates we believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates and our inability to report comparable store sales for the international segment in fiscal 2016 as a result of the canadian brand consolidation 

refer to the  nongaap financial measures  section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted the nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate nongaap net earnings from continuing operations and nongaap diluted eps from continuing operations in the presented periods 

refer to the  other financial measures  section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted the nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio management believes this ratio is an important indicator of our creditworthiness furthermore we believe that our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio is important for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our longterm debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth we also believe our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to 

that of retailers who own rather than lease their stores our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity our capital structure our desire to own or to lease the location the owner’s desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders 

business strategy 

during fiscal 2017 we executed against the three priorities we shared at the beginning of the year 

 

below is summary of our progress against these priorities 

 

best buy 2020 building the new blue 

in november 2012 we introduced our transformation strategy called  renew blue  since then we have stabilized comparable sales and increased our profitability a little more than four years later we have now completed renew blue and unveiled a new strategy best buy 2020 building the new blue 

our customers are at the core of best buy 2020 technology continues to evolve creating more excitement and opening up an increasing range of possibilities for our customers it is also creating more complexity and we believe many of our customers need our help our purpose is to help customers pursue their passions and enrich their lives with the help of technology we want to play two roles for them be their trusted adviser and solution provider and be their source for technology services for their home our customer value proposition is to be the leading technology expert who makes it easy for our customers to learn about and confidently enjoy the best technology 

from a financial standpoint we seek to gradually grow our revenue pursue ongoing cost savings necessary to both offset inflationary pressures and fund investments and build a more predictable set of revenue streams built on more recurring revenues and stickier customer relationships there are three growth pillars we will be pursuing as part of best buy 2020 

 

with the launch of best buy 2020 fiscal 2018 will revolve around the following four priorities

the net store changes did not have a material impact on our revenue in fiscal 2017 as the majority of closures related to our smallformat best buy mobile standalone stores the closing of smallformat best buy mobile stores have a significantly smaller impact given their smaller size and limited category focus compared to our largeformat stores 

the profitshare revenue included in our noncomparable sales relate to our extended warranty protection plans that are managed by a third party underwriter we may be eligible to receive profitsharing payments depending on the performance of the portfolio when performance of the portfolio is strong and the claims cost to the third party underwriter declines we are entitled to share in the excess premiums in fiscal 2017 we recognized 110 million of such profitshare revenue with an equal impact to gross profit and operating income in fiscal 2016 we recognized 148 million the fiscal 2017 profitshare revenue decrease from fiscal 2016 reflects reductions to the premiums that we pay to the third party underwriter in light of the continued impact of these lower premiums we expect the profit share payments to continue to decrease in future periods 

in fiscal 2017 domestic segment online revenue of 48 billion increased 208  on a comparable basis primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic as a percentage of total domestic revenue online revenue increased 240 basis points to 134  versus 110  last year 

the following table presents the domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2017  and 2016  



the following is a description of the notable comparable sales changes in our domestic segment by revenue category 

   

our domestic segment experienced an increase in gross profit rate to 239 in fiscal 2017 from 233 in fiscal 2016 this rate increase was primarily due to 1 rate improvements in computing hardware and 2 an increase in crt legal settlements partially offset by 1 lower margins from mobile phones due to changes in device mix and 2 a decrease in our periodic profit share revenue as described above 

our domestic segment sga rate slightly decreased to 189  of revenue in fiscal 2017 compared to 190  of revenue in the prior year the decrease in rate was primarily driven by cost reductions and lower incentive compensation partially offset by investments in growth initiatives 

  

our domestic segment recorded 31 million  of restructuring charges in fiscal 2017  and incurred 2 million  of restructuring charges in fiscal 2016  the restructuring charges in fiscal 2017 related to the renew blue phase 2  plan that began in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 refer to note 4 restructuring charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our restructuring activities

fiscal 2016  results compared with fiscal 2015   

domestic segment revenue of 364 billion  in fiscal 2016 increased 09  compared to the prior year this increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales growth of 05  which included an estimated 06 of revenue benefit associated with installment billing and a periodic profit sharing benefit based on performance of our externally managed extended service plan portfolio 

similar to fiscal 2017 we recognized 148 million of profitshare revenue in fiscal 2016 with an equal impact to gross profit and operating income the amount recognized in fiscal 2016 was substantially higher than for prior periods the unusually strong performance of the portfolio for fiscal 2016 which particularly related to mobile phones was due to changes to the design of our extended service plans improvements to our repair and fulfillment operations and industry trends these trends have also led to lower revenues from repairs we undertake on behalf of the insurers as discussed further below 

domestic segment online revenue of 40 billion increased 135 on a comparable basis primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic as a percentage of total domestic revenue online revenue increased 120 basis points to 110 versus 98 in fiscal 2015

additional consolidated results 

other income expense 

in fiscal 2017 our gain on sale of investments was 3 million compared to 2 million and 13 million in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively these gains were due to the sale of costbased investments 

in fiscal 2017 our investment income and other was 31 million compared to 13 million in fiscal 2016 the increase in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher interest rates in the us in fiscal 2016 our investment income and other was 13 million compared to 14 million in fiscal 2015 the decrease in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower interest rates in canada and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation 

interest expense was 72 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 80 million in fiscal 2016 due to a lower debt balance for a majority of the year caused by the march 2016 payment of our 350 million principal amount notes interest expense was 80 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 90 million in fiscal 2015 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to swapping a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate which was lower than our fixed rate refer to note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased to 609 million in fiscal 2017 compared to 503 million in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of an increase in pretax earnings partially offset by a higher mix of pretax income from foreign operations and the resolution of certain tax matters in the current year our effective income tax rate etr for fiscal 2017 was 335 compared to a rate of 384 in fiscal 2016 the decrease in the etr was primarily due to a higher mix of pretax income from foreign operations and the resolution of certain tax matters in the current year

discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources 

summary 

we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements depend on key variables including the level of investment required to support our business strategies the performance of our business capital expenditures credit facilities and shortterm borrowing arrangements and working capital management capital expenditures and share repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which to a large extent we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our renew blue and best buy 2020 building the new blue strategies 

the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at january 28 2017 and january 30 2016  in millions 



existing cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as well as cash generated from operations were sufficient to fund share repurchases capital expenditures dividends and repayment of our 2016 notes in fiscal 2017 without the need to utilize our credit facilities or other debt arrangements 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions 



operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to the timing of inventory purchasing and payments and increased earnings during fiscal 2017 we purchased and paid for inventory later in the holiday season than in the prior year discussed below positively impacting operating cash flows this was partially offset by the timing of collection of receivables 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and income tax payments during fiscal 2016 we decided to bring holiday inventory in early and the super bowl shifted to the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which caused us to hold our inventory longer and settle our accounts payable related to that inventory prior to yearend in addition we paid more income taxes in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the timing of when payments were made 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to an increase in the net investment into shortterm investments in fiscal 2017 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to increased sales of shortterm investments partially offset by capital expenditures see  capital expenditures  below 

financing activities 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  was primarily due to a decline in the number of shares repurchased which was substantially offset by the repayment of our 350 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2016 

the increase in cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to share repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal 2016 we purchased 10 billion of common stock as part of our june 2011 share repurchase program in addition we increased our normal dividend from 2015 to 2016 and paid a special dividend in 2016 

sources of liquidity 

funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments our credit facilities and other debt arrangements are our most significant sources of liquidity we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and anticipated capital expenditures strategic initiatives share repurchases and dividends however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to limit our spending there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing if necessary on favorable terms 

on june 26 2016 we entered into a 125 billion fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility the fiveyear facility agreement with a syndicate of banks the fiveyear facility agreement replaced the previous 125 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the previous facility which was originally scheduled to expire in june 2019 but was terminated on june 27 2016 the fiveyear facility agreement permits borrowings up to 125 billion and expires in june 2021 at january 

28 2017 and january 30 2016 we had no borrowings outstanding under the fiveyear facility agreement nor its predecessor the previous facility refer to note 5 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our credit facilities 

our ability to access our revolving credit facility under the fiveyear facility agreement is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the facility including financial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios at january 28 2017  we were in compliance with all such financial covenants if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt it would likely constitute an event of default under our facilities as well 

an interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense to fixed charges our interest coverage ratio calculated as reported in exhibit no 121 of this annual report on form 10k was 697  and 516  in fiscal 2017  and fiscal 2016  respectively 

  

our credit ratings and outlooks at march 20 2017  are summarized below in fiscal 2017 standard  poors rating services upgraded its longterm credit rating from bb to bbb with a stable outlook moodys investors service inc affirmed its longterm credit rating of baa1 with a stable outlook and fitch ratings limited affirmed its longterm credit rating of bbb with a stable outlook 



  

credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur they could impact among other things interest costs for certain of our credit facilities our future borrowing costs access to capital markets vendor financing terms and future newstore leasing costs 

  

restricted cash 

  

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for general liability insurance and workers compensation insurance restricted cash and cash equivalents related to our continuing operations which are included in other current assets remained relatively flat at 193 million  and 185 million  at january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively 

  

capital expenditures 

  

our capital expenditures typically include investments in our stores distribution capabilities and information technology enhancements including ecommerce during fiscal 2017 we invested 582 million in property and equipment primarily related to upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities and storerelated projects 

  

the following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions 





in fiscal 2018 we estimate cash capital expenditures of approximately 650 million to 700 million with the focus on retail store ecommerce and information technology projects 

debt and capital 

in march 2016 we repaid our 350 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2016 the 2016 notes using existing cash resources as of january 28 2017 we have 500 million principal amount of notes due august 1 2018 the 2018 notes and 650 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2021 the 2021 notes outstanding refer to note 5 debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our 2016 notes 2018 notes and 2021 notes 

share repurchases and dividends 

we repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors board our longterm capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth and then return excess cash over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment grade credit metrics 

on march 1 2017 we announced our intent to repurchase 30 billion shares over the next two years in order to execute this plan our board approved a new 50 billion share repurchase authorization in february 2017 this share repurchase program supersedes the previous 50 billion authorization dated june 2011 which had 22 billion remaining as of january 28 2017 there is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the february 2017 share repurchase program repurchased shares are retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares 

the following table presents our share repurchase history for each of the past three fiscal years in millions except per share amounts 



 

in fiscal 2004 our board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on common stock a quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter the payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions the following table presents our dividend activity for each of the past three fiscal years in millions except per share amounts 



 

dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2017 were relatively unchanged from fiscal 2016 noting that the quarterly dividend per share increased from 023 in fiscal 2016 to 028 in fiscal 2017 the increase in the regular dividend rate was substantially offset by fewer common shares due to a return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and a smaller special dividend dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2016 increased compared to the prior year due to an increase in the quarterly dividend per share increase from 018 in fiscal 2015 to 023 in fiscal 2016 and the payment of a special dividend in fiscal 2016 

on march 1 2017 we announced a 210 increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 034 per share 

other financial measures 

our current ratio calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities was 15 as of january 28 2017 compared to 14 at the end of fiscal 2016 the higher current ratio in fiscal 2017 was driven by an increase in cash and shortterm investments related to our higher earnings and a decrease in current portion of longterm debt related to the payment of our 2016 notes partially offset by an increase in accounts payable related to the timing of our inventory purchases 

our debt to earnings ratio was 11  as of january 28 2017  compared to 21  as of january 30 2016  due to higher earnings in the current year and a reduction in debt related to the payment of our 2016 notes our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio which includes capitalized operating lease obligations in its calculation was 16  and 18  as of january 28 2017  and january 30 2016  respectively the decrease in the ratio was due to a decrease in debt and capitalized operating lease obligations and an increase in earnings 

commencing in fiscal 2017 we modified the multiple used to calculate our estimated capitalized operating lease obligation included in our nongaap debt calculation due to changes in the average remaining lease life of our operating lease portfolio we have lowered the multiple used from eight times annual rent expense to five times annual rent expense the multiple of five aligns with the multiple used by one of the nationally recognized credit rating agencies when evaluating the creditworthiness of companies within the retail sector prior periods presented have been adjusted to use this new multiple 

our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio is calculated as follows 



  

the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio which excludes capitalized operating lease obligations from debt in the numerator of the calculation and does not adjust net earnings in the denominator of the calculation 

the following table presents a reconciliation of our debt to net earnings ratio to our nongaap debt to ebitdar ratio for continuing operations  in millions 





offbalancesheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

other than operating leases we do not have any offbalancesheet financing a summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the contractual obligations table below additional information regarding our operating leases is available in item 2 properties  and note 8 leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations as of january 28 2017 with payments due by period  in millions 



note for additional information refer to note 5 debt  note 8 leases  note 10 income taxes  and note 12 contingencies and commitments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

 

additionally we have 125 billion  in undrawn capacity on our credit facilities at january 28 2017  which if drawn upon would be included as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results these estimates require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board 

except where noted we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies for the areas described below 

inventory 

we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss adjustments markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net proceeds we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding factors such as forecast consumer demand the promotional environment and technological obsolescence 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown adjustments however if actual outcomes are different than we anticipated we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our markdown adjustment at january 28 2017  would have affected net earnings by approximately 8 million in fiscal 2017  

vendor allowances 

we receive allowances from certain vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements we treat a substantial majority of these allowances as an offset to the cost of the product or services provided sellthrough allowances are collected when inventory is sold to customers and recognized as a reduction in cost of sales at that time certain other types of funding most notably receiptbased allowances are collected when we take receipt of inventory and deferred as a reduction of inventory until inventory is sold the estimation of the deferral for these types of funding is complex and requires detailed analysis of factors such as product and vendor mix inventory turn and a range of allowance programs 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor funding deferral a 10 difference in our vendor funding deferral at january 28 2017  would have affected net earnings by approximately 23 million in fiscal 2017  

we also receive vendor allowances for achieving certain volume targets these vendor allowances are accrued as earned over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases or sales amounts accrued throughout the program year could require adjustment if actual purchase or sales volumes differ from projected volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated volume tiers are met we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases or sales over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowances to be received from our vendors since most volumebased programs apply to a calendar year or our fiscal year the amount of judgment required as of any fiscal year end is minimal 

property and equipment impairments 

property and equipment assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

when evaluating property and equipment assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis for a depreciable asset the new cost basis is depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset 

when reviewing property and equipment assets for impairment we group assets with other assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for assets deployed at store 

locations we review for impairment at the individual store level these reviews involve comparing the carrying value of all property and equipment located at each store to the net cash flow projections for each store in addition we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate for example a shared asset such as a distribution center or an it asset would be evaluated by reference to the aggregate assets and projected cash flows of all areas of the businesses utilizing those shared assets 

our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values including estimating cash flows and useful lives and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to impairments that could be material we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate property and equipment asset impairment losses 

goodwill 

goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the components of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted cash flows or relative marketbased approaches if the fair value exceeds carrying value then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value 

the carrying value of goodwill at january 28 2017  was 425 million which related entirely to our domestic segment in fiscal 2017  we determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value was substantial we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

tax contingencies 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any time many tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we may record a liability for such exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax 

rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate and would be recognized in the period of resolution 

revenue recognition 

the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the effects of future events 

returns – we recognize revenue net of estimated returns and sales incentives or allowances at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns with a corresponding reduction to revenue and cost of sales based on historical return data we believe that our estimate for sales returns which represents the estimated gross margin impact of returns is a reasonable reflection of future returns and financial impacts however if our estimates are significantly below or above the actual return amounts our reported revenue and cost of sales could be impacted a 10 difference in our returns reserve at january 28 2017  would have affected net earnings by approximately 2 million in fiscal 2017  

gift card breakage – we sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores through our websites and through select third parties a liability is initially established for the value of the gift card when sold we recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer for unredeemed gift cards we recognize breakage when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is deemed remote and we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to a relevant jurisdiction we determine the breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns and record projected breakage 24 months after card issuance we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to record breakage however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to a charge that could be material 

customer loyalty programs   –  we have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed with us or when using our cobranded credit cards points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases the value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed our estimate of the amount and timing of redemptions of certificates is based primarily on historical data a 10 difference in our customer redemption rates at january 28 2017  would have affected net earnings by approximately 13 million in fiscal 2017  

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions of our revenue recognition critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

new accounting pronouncements   

for a description of new applicable accounting pronouncements see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in shortterm market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense our cash and shortterm investments generate interest income that will vary based on changes in shortterm interest rates in addition we have swapped a portion of our fixedrate debt to floatingrate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with shortterm interest rates refer to note 5 debt    and note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our interest rate swaps 

as of january 28 2017 we had 39 billion  of cash and shortterm investments and 750 million  of debt that has been swapped to floating rate therefore we had net cash and shortterm investments of 32 billion  generating income which is exposed to interest rate changes as of january 28 2017 a 50 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would lead to an estimated 16 million  reduction in net interest expense and conversely a 50 basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would lead to an estimated 16 million  increase in net interest expense 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international segment operations on a limited basis we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecasted inventory purchases recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our canadian operations our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows as well as net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments which generally have terms of up to 12 months refer to note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our these instruments 

the strength of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar and mexican peso compared to the prioryear period had a negative overall impact on our revenue as these currencies translated into fewer us dollars we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue in fiscal 2017  of approximately 76 million and a net favorable impact on earnings of 4 million  in fiscal 2016 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately 534 million and a net favorable impact on earnings of 20 million

we had approximately 1200 largeformat and 400 smallformat stores at the end of fiscal 2016 throughout our domestic and international segments our stores are a vital component of our omnichannel strategy and represent an important competitive advantage in the us we have the ability to ship from all of our best buy stores customers may also elect to pick up orders initiated online in any of our stores in recent years we have opened vendor storewithinastore concepts to allow closer vendor partnership and a better quality customer experience in fiscal 2017 and beyond we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our store space renegotiating leases and selectively opening or closing locations to support our ongoing transformation 

in march 2015 we made a decision to consolidate future shop and best buy stores and websites in canada under the best buy brand this resulted in permanently closing 66 future shop stores and converting 65 future shop stores to the best buy brand

we fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows generated from operations in addition our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs for general corporate purposes and investment and growth opportunities our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales 

competition 

our competitors are primarily multichannel retailers internetbased businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers we believe our ability to deliver a high quality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage some of our competitors have low cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price in addition in the us onlineonly operators are exempt from collecting sales taxes in certain states we believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are reevaluated at both the state and federal levels we carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities in addition we have a pricematching policy in the us that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators in order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships we believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people integrated online and retail assets broad product assortment strong vendor relationships range of focused service and support offerings distinct store formats brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage

 item 1a risk factors 

described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10k and in our other public disclosures the risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial all forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below 

we face strong competition from multichannel retailers internetbased businesses technology service providers traditional storebased retailers and vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers which directly affects our revenue and profitability 

the retail business is highly competitive price is of great importance to most customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology the ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers and technology service providers as well as certain of our vendors and mobile network carriers who offer products directly to consumers some of our competitors have greater financial resources than us and may be able to offer lower prices than us for a sustained period of time the retail industry continues to experience a trend towards an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications and some onlineonly businesses have lower operating costs than us and are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all us states which can negatively impact the ability of multichannel retailers to be price competitive on a taxincluded basis online and multichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery costs depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit margins because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service and a full range of services to complement the products we offer our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors and this in conjunction with price transparency puts pressure on our margins 

as these and related competitive factors evolve we may experience material adverse pressure on our revenue and profitability 

consumer electronics products are highly susceptible to technological advancement and changes in consumer preferences 

in general consumer electronics product life cycles which begin with initial market launch and conclude with maturity or obsolescence have become shorter and less predictable this is largely due to rapid technological advancement and innovation and generally faster adoption by consumers consumer preferences have also become susceptible to rapid change and this adds to the unpredictability of our business these factors affect us in a number of ways for example 

 

the effects of these factors can also be exacerbated by the competitive environment and the ease with which customers can research and compare product features and price if we fail to interpret predict and react to these factors in a timely and effective manner the consequences can include 

 

these and other similar factors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our revenue and profitability 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors in fiscal 2016 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 75 of the merchandise we purchased 73 in fiscal 2015 with 5 suppliers – apple samsung hewlettpackard sony and lg electronics – representing approximately 51 of total merchandise purchased 47 in fiscal 2015 we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or any other terms our profitability depends on us securing acceptable terms with our vendors for among other things the price of merchandise we purchase from them funding for various forms of promotional programs payment terms allocations of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties to varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their competitive advantages  for example their financial strength the strength of their brand with customers their own stores or online channels or their relationships with other retailers  to our commercial disadvantage with a consequent adverse impact on our profitability the potential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices and a highly competitive retail environment generally our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller proportion of their total revenues consequently impacting our profitability from such vendor relationships 

we are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business for example if carriers change the structure of customer contracts customer upgrade terms customer qualification requirements monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenues and profitability in addition our carriers also may serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels carriers may decide to 

cease allowing us to offer their contracts focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our commissions or other terms each of these potential factors could have a materially adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 

we have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner can be a challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us political or financial instability merchandise quality issues product safety concerns trade restrictions work stoppages port delays tariffs foreign currency exchange rates transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

our focus on services as a strategic imperative exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and profitability as well as our reputation 

our customer promises include provision of a full range of services to complement our product offerings including consultation design delivery installation setup protection plans repair technical support and educational classes these services can differentiate us from many of our competitors and provide an opportunity to deliver superior customer service while generating incremental revenue and profit however designing marketing and executing these services successfully and consistently is subject to incremental risks these risks include for example 

 

in addition as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions it is inherently more difficult to demonstrate and explain the features and benefits of our service offerings which can lead to a lower revenue mix of these services if for these or other reasons we fail to design and market services effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers’ expectations in the execution of these services our reputation revenue and profitability could be adversely affected 

macroeconomic pressures in the us and key international markets could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results 

to varying degrees our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending as a result consumers may be affected in many different ways including for example 

 

consumer confidence employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations costs for items such as fuel and food and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumers demand for the products and services that we offer our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors 

interruptions to our supply chain and other factors affecting our distribution may adversely affect our business 

our supply chain is a critical part of our operations particularly in light of recent industry trends and initiatives such as shipfromstore and the emphasis on fast and free delivery when purchasing online we also depend on third parties for certain aspects of our supply chain network in managing our supply chain we are exposed to the following risks for example which may not be fully controllable by us 

 

 

the risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of carriers with the scope and capacity required by our business the aforementioned channel shift increases our exposure to these risks if we fail to manage these risks effectively we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation revenue and profitability 

if we fail to attract retain and engage appropriately qualified employees including employees in key positions our business and operating results may be harmed 

our performance is highly dependent on attracting retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees including our executive team and other employees in key positions our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce the turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages failure to recruit or retain qualified employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities in addition a significant amount of turnover of our executive team or other employees in key positions with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations 

demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition 

we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation we believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success the ubiquity of social media means that customer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty decreases in gift card and service plan sales lower employee retention and productivity vendor relationship issues and other factors all of which could materially affect our revenue and profitability 

our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies 

we operate in a highlycompetitive and everchanging commercial environment our success is dependent on our ability to identify develop and execute appropriate strategies within this environment strategies that have proved successful in the past may not be successful in the future our current strategy includes transformational change to certain areas of our business and the pursuit of new growth opportunities it is possible that our strategies may prove to be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in the future it is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies or that they expose us to additional risks our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to develop and execute appropriate strategies the market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further information regarding our strategies 

failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 

effective management of our real estate portfolio is critical to our omnichannel strategy we primarily secure properties through operating leases with thirdparty landlords in light of the longterm nature of most of these commitments it is essential that we effectively evaluate a range of factors that may influence our longterm real estate strategy such factors include for example 

 10 

 

if we fail to effectively evaluate these factors fail to negotiate terms which keep us market competitive or if unforeseen changes arise the consequences could include for example 

 

these consequences could have a materially adverse impact on our profitability cash flows and liquidity 

for leased property the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local real estate market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors and the costs of exiting a property can be significant we are still responsible for the maintenance taxes insurance and common area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated similarly when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we usually retain our obligations as the master lessor this leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the sublease tenant 

failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

some of our operating costs are fixed andor are subject to multiyear contracts some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors because for example of our differential service offerings or levels of customer service as discussed above our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues accordingly our ongoing drive to reduce cost and increase efficiency represents a strategic imperative failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives 

our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms 

we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit and our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders these factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue business opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 

our credit ratings and outlooks at january 30 2016 are summarized below in fiscal 2016 standard  poors rating services upgraded its longterm credit rating from bb to bb with a stable outlook moodys investors service inc upgraded its longterm credit rating from baa2 to baa1 with a stable outlook fitch ratings limited upgraded its longterm credit rating from bb to bbb with a stable outlook 



any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets borrowing costs vendor terms and lease terms our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 

we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

  

approximately onethird of our revenue and more than onehalf of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico in addition the holiday shopping season also incorporates many other unpredictable factors such as the level of promotional activity and customer buying patterns and forecasting and reacting to these factors quickly is difficult unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters product sourcing issues failure or interruption of management information systems or disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors could significantly disrupt our operations as a result of these factors there is a risk that our fourth quarter and annual results are adversely affected 

failure to effectively manage strategic ventures alliances or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business 

in the future we may decide to enter into new ventures alliances or acquisitions assessing a potential opportunity can be based on assumptions that might not ultimately prove to be correct in addition the amount of information we can obtain about a potential opportunity may be limited 

the success of ventures alliances or acquisitions is also largely dependent on the current and future participation working relationship and strategic vision of the venture or alliance partners which can change following a transaction integrating new businesses stores or concepts can be difficult and risky these types of transactions may divert our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities and may also negatively impact our return on invested capital entering into new ventures alliances or acquisitions may also impair our relationships with our vendors or other strategic partners we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate businesses that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures or we may encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting failure to effectively integrate and manage strategic ventures alliances and acquisitions could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity and may require impairment of associated goodwill tradenames or other assets 

failure to protect the integrity security and confidentiality of our employee and customer data could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our employees or customers 

the use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state federal and international levels we are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information increasing costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff the costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially additionally the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks including the use of cashless payments while we take significant steps to protect this information lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures as a result unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may not prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or our relationship with our employees which may in turn have a negative impact on our revenue and may expose us to material costs penalties and compensation claims in addition any compromise of our data 

security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk 

natural disasters changes in climate geopolitical events or other catastrophes could adversely affect our operating results 

the risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could materially adversely affect our financial performance such events may be caused by for example 

 

such events can adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network as a consequence of these or other catastrophic events we may endure interruption to our operations or losses of property equipment or inventory which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability 

our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results 

sales of our exclusive brands products which include insignia modal dynex init platinum and rocketfish branded products represent an important component of our revenue most of these products are manufactured by contract manufacturers based in southeastern asia this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

 

maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate revenue and achieve acceptable margins failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the profits we are able to generate from them 

we are subject to certain statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are 

 

 

regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance additionally defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters 

changes to the national labor relations act or other laborrelated statutes or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model 

as an employer of approximately 125000 people in a large number of different jurisdictions we are subject to risks related to employment laws and regulations including for example 

 

changes to laws and regulations such as these could adversely impact our reputation our ability to continue operations and thus our revenue and profitability 

economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect our ability to offer attractive promotional financing to our customers and adversely affect the profits we generate from these programs 

  

we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by thirdparty banks that manage and directly extend credit to our customers customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low or nointerest financing on qualifying purchases we view our financing programs as a way to generate incremental revenue of products and services from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment approximately 21 of our fiscal 2016 revenue was transacted using one of the companys branded cards in addition we earn profitshare income from our banking partners based on the performance of the programs the income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors including the volume and value of transactions the terms of promotional financing offers bad debt rates interest rates the regulatory and competitive environment and expenses of operating the program adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the programs 

  

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems we rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing services fulfillment staff planning and deployment website offerings financial management reporting and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate whether from internal or external factors or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business could significantly disrupt our business and cause for example higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation 

we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels or other technical difficulties could cause us to forego material revenues and adversely affect our reputation with consumers 

  

we utilize thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our business operations 

  

we engage key thirdparty business partners to support various functions of our business including but not limited to information technology web hosting and cloudbased services human resource operations customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards gift cards customer warranty technical support and insurance programs any material disruption in our relationship with key thirdparty business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our operations particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods 

our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above as well as to risks associated with the legislative judicial regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

  

we operate retail locations in canada and mexico in addition we have wholly owned legal entities registered in various other foreign countries including bermuda china germany hong kong japan luxembourg the republic of mauritius the netherlands taiwan turks and caicos and the uk during fiscal 2016 our international segments operations generated 8 of our revenue in general the risk factors identified above also have relevance to our international operations in addition our international operations also expose us to other risks including those related to for example 

   

these factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability and could lead to us incurring material impairments and other exit costs 

failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price 

  

we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results or other forwardlooking information for future periods although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to our existing and potential stockholders such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided if our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of market participants or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results unless otherwise noted transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude our mda is presented in the following sections 

 

our mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we are a leading provider of technology products services and solutions we offer these products and services to the customers who visit our stores engage with geek squad agents or use our websites or mobile applications we have operations in the us canada and mexico we operate two reportable segments domestic and international the domestic segment is 

comprised of all operations within the us and its districts and territories the international segment is comprised of all operations outside the us and its territories 

throughout this mda we refer to comparable sales our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year relocated stores as well as remodeled expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition the calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our international segment only the canadian brand consolidation which includes the permanent closure of 66 future shop stores the conversion of 65 future shop stores to best buy stores and the elimination of the future shop website has a material impact on a yearoveryear basis on the remaining canadian retail stores and the website as such all canadian store and website revenue has been removed from the comparable sales base and the international segment no longer has a comparable metric in fiscal 2016 and the enterprise comparable sales equals the domestic segment comparable sales enterprise comparable sales for periods presented prior to fiscal 2016 include revenue from our international segment 

the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods 

in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment’s operating results from local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prioryear period’s currency exchange rates we use this method to calculate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for all countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

in our discussions of the operating results below we sometimes refer to the impact of net new stores on our results of operations the key factors that dictate the impact that the net new stores have on our operating results include i store opening and closing decisions ii the size and format of new stores as we operate stores ranging from approximately 1000 square feet to approximately 50000 square feet iii the length of time the stores were open during the period and iv the overall success of new store launches 

when assessing our performance in consumer electronics categories against other retailers we often reference the npd groups npd weekly tracking service for the appropriate period npd defines the consumer electronics industry as including televisions desktop and notebook computers tablets not including kindle digital imaging and other categories sales of these products represent approximately 65 of our domestic segment revenue in fiscal 2016 the data does not include mobile phones appliances services gaming apple watch movies or music 

this mda includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap as well as certain adjusted or nongaap financial measures such as nongaap operating income nongaap effective tax rate nongaap net earnings from continuing operations nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted debt to earnings before goodwill impairment interest income taxes depreciation amortization and rent ebitdar ratio generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

we believe that the nongaap measures described above provide meaningful supplemental information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes adjusted operating income adjusted effective tax rate adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management makes standard adjustments for items such as restructuring charges goodwill impairments nonrestructuring asset impairments and gains or losses on investments as well as adjustments for other items that may arise during the period and have a meaningful impact on comparability refer to the nongaap financial measures  section below for the detailed reconciliation of items that impacted the nongaap measures in the presented periods management believes our 

adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is an important indicator of our creditworthiness because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures within our discussion of consolidated performance below provide a more complete understanding of our business we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

business strategy 

on a full year basis fiscal 2016 marked the second year in a row we increased our domestic segment revenue and expanded our operating margin we also continued to make significant progress against our renew blue  strategy during the year we continued to gain share in appliances and nearly all of our traditional consumer electronics categories we grew the domestic segment online revenue 13 to over 4 billion or 11 of total domestic segment revenue in fiscal 2016 we increased our net promoter score nps by over 300 basis points we continued to improve our employee engagement scores and decreased employee turnover we deepened our partnerships with the top tech companies in the world we delivered 150 million against our 400 million renew blue  phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program we consolidated brands and embarked on a significant transformation in canada including the closure of 68 stores and finally in one year we returned 15 billion in cash to our shareholders including 1 billion in share repurchases which was originally planned to be completed over three years 

fiscal 2017 priorities 

turning to fiscal 2017 we are entering the next phase of our renew blue  strategy our purpose from a customer standpoint is to build a company that does a unique job of helping customers learn about and enjoy the latest technology as we begin this next phase in fiscal 2017 we will focus on the following priorities 1 building on our strong industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business 2 driving cost reduction and efficiencies and 3 advancing key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation 

our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business more specifically we plan to implement a number of initiatives across merchandising marketing digital stores services and supply chain 

our second priority for fiscal 2017 is to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business reducing costs is essential for us to be able to fund our investments build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time furthermore based on current economic factors and softness in the consumer electronics industry it is essential that we be proactive on the cost reduction front 

a key element of our approach to achieving this is to simplify our core business processes to simultaneously improve the customer experience and drive costs out as an example we have a project focused on reducing the amount of open box appliances we take into our stores by addressing root cause issues this project has the potential to not only improve the customer experience but also to drive material savings through lower markdowns lower transportation costs and better use of labor in our stores and distribution centers 

more broadly we aspire to deliver worldclass operational performance defined in terms of quality service and cost this focus has to be a way of life especially given our margin structure and the volatility of our industry in fiscal 2016 we announced a specific cost reduction and gross profit optimization program called renew blue  phase 2 with a goal of 400 million over three years on top of the 1 billion we eliminated as part of phase 1 in fiscal 2015 

against that goal in fiscal 2016 we achieved 150 million of annualized savings leaving us with 250 million remaining in light of our increased focus on cost and productivity we believe there are incremental savings that can be achieved above and beyond our current goal partially offsetting these savings however will be our expected future investments in the areas of labor expertise services pricing and key growth initiatives in fiscal 2016 these investments totaled approximately 100 million and we expect a similar level in fiscal 2017 which again will be funded by our cost savings 

our third priority is to advance key initiatives to more deeply transform our company in order to drive future growth and differentiation while there may be shortterm pressures we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity rich environment the internet of things is providing a new technology wave and is making our operating model increasingly relevant to customers 

we are investing to be the leading technology expert who makes it easy to learn about and confidently enjoy the best technology in this context we believe we have ongoing growth opportunities around key product categories as well as from increasing our share of wallet with existing customers and acquiring new customers within our target segment who are passionate about technology and need help with it our services capabilities and geek squad are key building blocks of this strategy while it is not visible in our services top line results today we are making progress to bring these opportunities to life 

over the last two years we have improved many aspects of our extended service plan and repair operations we have also had to adjust our pricing of our extended service plans we are seeing the results of our efforts through substantial increases in nps higher total customer interactions and from a financial point of view the periodic profit sharing payments we earned this year we are also beginning to see improving attach rates as we enter fiscal 2017 

building on this foundational work we will continue our work to improve the customer experience and enhance our service offering and capabilities in support of our mission to help customers learn about and enjoy the latest technology while we are energized by the potential of this opportunity the work necessary to capture it takes time thus fiscal 2017 will be another year of gradual and incremental improvement with more meaningful results expected in fiscal 2018 

fiscal 2017 trends 

we believe that the consumer electronics industry will continue to be characterized by product innovation cycles we are undeterred by this fact  as we believe there will always be technology innovation our imperative is that in these cycles we continue to deliver superior execution against what is in our control recognizing that the cycles rarely align at any point in time 

in fiscal 2017 we are focused on continuing to build on our foundation to both drive and capitalize on these technology cycles in parallel we are focused on building the key initiatives outlined above that we believe will result in stronger relationships with our customers provide profitable revenue even during down cycles and continue to create longterm shareholder value 

over time as the fruit of these key initiatives materialize we expect to accelerate our revenue and operating income growth by taking advantage of opportunities provided by ongoing technology innovation and the need customers have for help in the shortterm we expect to be characterized by our strong cash flow generating capabilities and our intent to regularly return excess free cash flow to shareholders 

from a financial outlook perspective for fiscal 2017 based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out in our domestic segment we are expecting revenue declines in the first half followed by growth in the back half we also expect that our strong execution and operational capabilities will allow us to continue to gain market share in this context we are targeting flat domestic segment revenue for the full fiscal year due to continued growth in appliances connected home and home theater in particular but recognize that it will be challenging without a strong mobile cycle and improvements in the npdreported categories overall 

despite the soft revenue environment we will target approximately flat operating income including the lapping of the significant periodic profit sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016 a key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives in addition we intend to reward our shareholders by being a premium dividend payer and increasing our eps through ongoing share repurchases 

after three consecutive years of strong cash flow generation under renew blue  we believe now is an ideal time to provide a view of our longterm capital allocation strategy this strategy is based on our strong cash position today and our ongoing confidence in our future cashflow generation at the core of this strategy is our intent to first fund our operations and growth investments including potential acquisitions and then to return the remaining excess free cash flow to our shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment grade credit metrics this strategy targets the return of excess free cash flow to shareholders through a 35 to 45 nongaap dividend payout ratio defined as dividends divided by nongaap net earnings and regular share repurchases with a minimum annual expectation of offsetting dilution from equity compensation 

in line with this strategy our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan includes 1 a 22 increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 028 per share 2 the intent to repurchase 1 billion worth of shares over the next two years and 3 a special dividend of 045 per share or approximately 145 million this is in addition to the 15 billion in cash we returned to shareholders in fiscal 2016 

results of operations 

in order to align our fiscal reporting periods and comply with statutory filing requirements in certain foreign jurisdictions we consolidate the financial results of our mexico operations as well as our discontinued china and europe operations on a onemonth lag consistent with such consolidation the financial and nonfinancial information presented in our mda relative to these operations is also presented on a lag our policy is to accelerate the recording of events occurring in the lag period that significantly affect our consolidated financial statements there were no significant intervening events which would have materially affected our financial condition results of operations liquidity or other factors had they been recorded during fiscal 2016 

discontinued operations presentation 

the results of mindshift technologies inc mindshift in our domestic segment and best buy europe and five star in our international segment are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of earnings unless otherwise stated financial results discussed herein refer to continuing operations 

domestic segment installment billing plans 

in april 2014 we began to sell installment billing plans offered by mobile carriers to our customers to complement the more traditional twoyear plans while the two types of contracts have broadly similar overall economics installment billing plans typically generate higher revenues due to higher proceeds for devices and higher cost of sales due to lower device subsidies as we increase our mix of installment billing plans there is an associated increase in revenue and cost of goods sold and a decrease in gross profit rate with gross profit dollars relatively unaffected this change in plan offer does not impact our international segment 

the following table presents our domestic and enterprise comparable sales and the estimated benefit of installment billing for fiscal 2016 and 2015

fiscal 2016  results compared with fiscal 2015   

we offer extended protection plans that are managed by third party insurers we may also be eligible to receive profitsharing payments depending on the performance of the portfolio when performance of the portfolio is strong and the cost to the third party insurer declines we are entitled to share in the excess profits in fiscal 2016 we recognized 148 million of such profitshare revenue with an equal impact to gross profit and operating income we exclude such profitshare revenue from comparable sales calculations the amount recognized in fiscal 2016 was substantially higher than for prior periods the unusually strong performance of the portfolio for fiscal 2016 which particularly related to mobile phones was due to changes to the design of our extended service plans improvements to our repair and fulfillment operations and industry trends these trends have also led to lower revenues from repairs we undertake on behalf of the insurers as discussed further below the premiums we pay to insurers are periodically adjusted to reflect such trends and consequently we do not expect profit share payments to continue at this level in future periods 

domestic segment revenue of 364 billion in fiscal 2016 increased 09 compared to the prior year this increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales growth of 05 which included an estimated 06 of revenue benefit associated with installment billing and a periodic profit sharing benefit based on performance of our externally managed extended service plan portfolio 

domestic segment online revenue of 40 billion increased 135 on a comparable basis primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic as a percentage of total domestic revenue online revenue increased 120 basis points to 110 versus 98 last year

as discussed above which typically earns a low gross profit rate 5 an increased mix of highermargin large screen televisions and 6 positive revenue impact related to our credit card portfolio these increases were partially offset by 1 lower rates related to large appliances 2 a lower rate in the mobile category driven by increased sales of higher priced iconic mobile phones which have higher gross profit dollars but carry a lower gross profit rate 3 decrease in margin for portable audio products 4 a decreased mix of highermargin digital imaging products 5 an increased mix of lowermargin wearable devices and 6 an investment in services pricing

domestic segment revenue increased from 358 billion in fiscal 2014 to 361 billion in fiscal 2015  primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 10  excluding the 05 of revenue estimated benefit associated with the classification of the new mobile carrier installment billing plans comparable sales increased 05 online revenue was 35 billion and we experienced comparable online sales growth of 167  due to 1 improved inventory availability made possible by the chainwide rollout of our shipfromstore capability that was completed in january 2014 2 higher average order value and 3 increased traffic driven by greater investment in online digital marketing 

the components of the 06  revenue increase in the domestic segment in fiscal 2015  were as follows 



 

the net store changes did not have a material impact on our revenue in fiscal 2015  as the majority of closures occurred in the fourth quarter and related to our smallformat best buy mobile standalone stores the closing of smallformat best buy mobile stores have a significantly smaller impact given their smaller size and limited category focus compared to our largeformat stores 

the following table presents the domestic segments revenue mix percentages and comparable sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2015  and 2014  

the following is a description of the notable comparable sales changes in our domestic segment by revenue category 

   

our domestic segment experienced a decrease in gross profit of  194 million  or 23  in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  the most significant driver of the decrease was 314 million of lcd legal settlement proceeds that we received in fiscal 2014 excluding these lcd settlements we experienced an increase in gross profit of 120 million and the gross profit rate increased 02 of revenue the primary drivers of the gross profit rate increase were 1 the benefit from the realization of our renew blue cost reductions and other supply chain cost containment initiatives including initiatives related to returns replacements and damages 2 a more structured and analytical approach to pricing notably the fourth quarter and 3 increased revenue in highermargin largescreen televisions these increases were offset by a mix shift into lowermargin gaming and computing categories and a highly competitive promotional environment in tablets 

our domestic segments sga decreased  367 million  or 52  in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  in addition the sga rate decreased by 12  of revenue compared to the prior year the decreases in sga and sga rate were primarily driven by the realization of renew blue cost reduction initiatives and the benefit from tighter expense management throughout the company these declines were partially offset by renew blue investments in online growth and our instore experience as well as higher incentive compensation 

  

our domestic segment recorded 4 million  of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015  and incurred 123 million  of restructuring charges in fiscal 2014  these restructuring charges had an immaterial impact on our operating income rate in fiscal 2015 and resulted in a decrease in our operating income rate in fiscal 2014 of 03 of revenue refer to note 4 restructuring charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our restructuring activities 

  

our domestic segment’s operating income increased  292 million  or 08  of revenue in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  the increase was driven by lower sga a comparable sales gain and lower restructuring charges partially offset by the decrease in gross profit from the prioryear lcd settlements described above 

international segment 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we consolidated the future shop and best buy stores and websites in canada under the best buy brand this resulted in the permanent closure of 66 future shop stores and the conversion of the remaining 65 future shop stores to the best buy brand the costs of implementing these changes primarily consisted of lease exit costs a tradename impairment property and equipment impairments employee termination benefits and inventory writedowns in fiscal 2016 we incurred total pretax restructuring charges other canadian brand consolidation charges charges that did not qualify as restructuring charges and property and equipment impairment of 209 million of out of the previously disclosed expected range of approximately 210 million to 250 million related to those actions as we continue to solidify our strategy for our canada transformation we may incur additional charges of up to 35 million in future periods primarily related to nonrestructuring asset impairments

fiscal 2016  results compared with fiscal 2015   

in our international segment revenue declined 262  to 32 billion in fiscal 2016 due to 1 the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the canadian brand consolidation 2 a negative foreign currency impact of 125 and 3 ongoing softness in the canadian economy and consumer electronics industry 

the components of the international segments 262  revenue decrease in fiscal 2016  were as follows 



 

the following table presents the international segments revenue mix percentages by revenue category in fiscal 2016  and 2015  



as noted above comparable sales information has not been provided for the international segment for fiscal 2016 due to the canadian brand consolidation as such it is also impractical to provide such information on a revenue category basis however as noted above the revenue mix by category has not changed significantly from fiscal 2015 

our international segment experienced a gross profit decline of 260 million  or 269  in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the decrease in gross profit was 141 million the gross profit rate declined to 224 of revenue in fiscal 2016 from 226 of revenue in fiscal 2015 this decline was primarily due to the disruptive impacts from the canadian brand consolidation and increased promotional activity in canada 

our international segments sga decreased 232 million  or 243  in fiscal 2016  compared to the prior year excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the decrease in sga was 115 million however the sga expense rate increased to 228 of revenue in fiscal 2016 from 222 of revenue in fiscal 2015 the decrease in sga expense was driven by the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the canadian brand consolidation the increase in the sga rate was driven by yearoveryear sales deleverage 

our international segment recorded 199 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2016  and incurred 1 million  of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015  the fiscal 2016  restructuring charges primarily related to the canadian brand consolidation and consisted of facility closure costs tradename impairments property and equipment impairments and employee termination benefits the restructuring charges in fiscal 2015 had an immaterial impact on our operating income rate refer to note 4 restructuring charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our restructuring activities 

our international segment operating loss of 210 million  in fiscal 2016  compared to income of 13 million  in the prioryear period the decline in operating income was driven primarily by a decrease in revenue and gross profit rate and restructuring charges partially offset by lower sga expenses as described above 

fiscal 2015  results compared with fiscal 2014   

our international segment experienced a decrease in revenue of 104  primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations a comparable sales decline of 35  and the loss of revenue from store closures in canada 

the components of the international segments 104  revenue decrease in fiscal 2015  were as follows 



 

the net closure of largeformat stores in canada contributed to the decrease in revenue associated with net store changes in our international segment in fiscal 2015 the addition of large and smallformat stores in mexico partially offset this decrease 

the following table presents the international segments revenue mix percentages and comparable sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2015  and 2014  



the following is a description of the notable comparable sales changes in our international segment by revenue category 

 

our international segment experienced a gross profit decline of  158 million  or 140  in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the decrease in gross profit was 88 million the gross profit rate decline of 09  of revenue was driven by canada due to increased promotional activity and to a lesser extent higher revenue in the lowermargin gaming category 

our international segments sga decreased  147 million  or 134  in fiscal 2015  compared to the prior year excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the decrease in sga was 81 million in addition the sga rate decreased by 08  of revenue in fiscal 2015  the decrease in sga and sga rate was primarily driven by renew blue cost reductions and store closures in canada 

our international segment recorded 1 million  of restructuring charges in fiscal 2015  and 26 million  of restructuring charges in fiscal 2014  the restructuring charges had an immaterial impact on our operating income rate in fiscal 2015 and resulted in a 

decrease in our operating income rate in fiscal 2014 of 05 of revenue refer to note 4 restructuring charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our restructuring activities 

our international segment operating income of 13 million  in fiscal 2015  compared to a loss of 1 million  in the prioryear period the improvement in operating income was driven primarily by a decrease in sga partially offset by a decrease in gross profit as described above 

additional consolidated results 

other income expense 

in fiscal 2016 our gain on sale of investments was 2 million compared to 13 million and 20 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 respectively these gains were due to the sale of costbased investments 

in fiscal 2016 our investment income and other was 13 million compared to 14 million in the prior year the decrease in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to lower interest rates in canada and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations in fiscal 2015 our investment income and other was 14 million compared to 19 million in fiscal 2014 the decrease in fiscal 2015 was due to lower returns on our deferred compensation assets partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher average cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment balances 

interest expense was 80 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 90 million in fiscal 2015 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to swapping a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate which was lower than our fixed rate refer to note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information interest expense was 90 million in fiscal 2015 compared to 100 million in fiscal 2014 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to obtaining a lower interest rate of 500 on our 2018 notes compared to our previously held notes that bore interest at 675 

income tax expense 

income tax expense increased to 503 million in fiscal 2016 compared to a tax expense of 141 million in the prior year primarily due to a 353 million discrete benefit related to reorganizing certain european legal entities in the prior year period as well as a lower mix of pretax earnings from foreign operations in fiscal 2016 partially offset by a decrease in pretax earnings in fiscal 2016 our effective income tax rate etr for fiscal 2016 was 384 compared to a rate of 101 in fiscal 2015 excluding the impact of reorganizing certain european legal entities the etr would have been 356 in fiscal 2015 refer to note 10 income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income tax expense decreased to 141 million in fiscal 2015 compared to a tax expense of 388 million in the fiscal 2014 primarily due to a 353 million discrete benefit related to reorganizing certain european legal entities partially offset by an increase in pretax earnings in the currentyear period our etr was 101 in fiscal 2015 compared to 358 in fiscal 2014 

our consolidated etr is impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower statutory rates than the 35 us federal statutory rate changes in the proportion of our consolidated taxable earnings originating in foreign jurisdictions impact our consolidated effective rate our foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax 

discontinued operations 

discontinued operations consists primarily of best buy europe and five star in our international segment as well as mindshift in our domestic segment 

the earnings from discontinued operations was 90 million in fiscal 2016 compared to a loss of 11 million and 172 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 respectively earnings in fiscal 2016 were due to the gain recognized on the sale of five star the loss from discontinued operations of 11 million in fiscal 2015 was driven by charges related to five star the loss from discontinued operation of 172 million in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the impairment of our investment in best buy europe as well as the loss on the sale of mindshift 

nongaap financial measures 

the periods used for analysis of nongaap financial performance represent the periods that management used internally to assess performance 

the following table reconciles operating income effective income tax rate net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the periods presented from continuing operations gaap financial measures to nongaap operating income nongaap effective income tax rate nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations nongaap financial measures for the periods presented  in millions except per share amounts 

 

 

nongaap operating income for fiscal 2016 increased 69 million compared to fiscal 2015 the increase was driven by increased revenue in the domestic segment increased enterprise gross profit rate and continued sga cost reductions in both segments primarily due to the realization of our renew blue  cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management the increase in nongaap operating income resulted in a yearoveryear increase in nongaap net earnings from continuing operations and nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

nongaap operating income for fiscal 2015 increased 334 million compared to fiscal 2014 and nongaap operating income as a percent of revenue increased to 37 the increase in nongaap operating income was driven by sga cost reductions in both segments primarily due to the realization of our renew blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management partially offset by a decline in revenue in our international segment the increase in nongaap operating income resulted in a yearoveryear increase in nongaap net earnings from continuing operations and nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

liquidity and capital resources 

summary 

we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements depend on key variables including the level of investment required to support our business strategies the performance of our business capital expenditures credit facilities and shortterm borrowing arrangements and working capital management capital expenditures are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which to a large extent we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our renew blue transformation 

the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at january 30 2016 and january 31 2015  in millions 



the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from january 31 2015 was primarily due to a resumption of share repurchases a special dividend and an increase in the regular quarterly dividend this was partially offset by cash generated from operating activities 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions 



operating activities 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts and income tax payments during fiscal 2016 we decided to bring holiday inventory in early and the super bowl shifted to the first quarter of fiscal 2017 which caused us to hold our inventory longer and settle our accounts payable related to that inventory prior to yearend in addition we paid more income taxes in fiscal 2016 primarily due to the timing of when payments were made 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to improved management of working capital in fiscal 2015 additionally in fiscal 2014 there were larger cash outflows from accounts payable following unusually high balances at the end of fiscal 2013 due to timing of inventory receipts 

investing activities 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to increased sales of shortterm investments partially offset by capital expenditures see  capital expenditures  below 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014  was primarily due to increased purchases of shortterm investments in fiscal 2015 

financing activities 

the increase in cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  was primarily due to share repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal 2016 we purchased 10 billion of common stock as part of our june 2011 share repurchase program in addition we increased our normal dividend from 2015 to 2016 and paid a special dividend in 2016 

the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to decreased borrowing and decreased proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from the exercise of employee stock options 

sources of liquidity 

funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments our credit facilities and other debt arrangements and trade payables are our most significant sources of liquidity we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations and to finance anticipated capital investments and strategic initiatives however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to limit our spending there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing if necessary on favorable terms 

on june 30 2014 we entered into a new 125 billion fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility the fiveyear facility agreement with a syndicate of banks that expires in june 2019 the fiveyear facility agreement replaced the previous 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was originally scheduled to expire in october 2016 but was terminated on june 30 2014 at january 31 2015 and january 30 2016 we had no borrowings outstanding under the fiveyear facility agreement refer to note 5 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our credit facilities 

our ability to access our revolving credit facility under the fiveyear facility agreement is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the facility including financial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios at january 30 2016  we were in compliance with all such financial covenants if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt it would likely constitute an event of default under our facilities as well 

an interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense to fixed charges our interest coverage ratio calculated as reported in exhibit no 121 of this annual report on form 10k was 516  and 508  in fiscal 2016  and fiscal 2015  respectively 

  

our credit ratings and outlooks at march 21 2016  are summarized below on august 15 2015 standard  poors rating services standard  poors upgraded its longterm credit rating from bb to bb with a stable outlook on august 24 2015 moodys investors service inc moodys upgraded its longterm credit rating from baa2 to baa1 with a stable 

outlook on august 26 2015 fitch ratings limited fitch upgraded its longterm credit rating from bb to bbb with a stable outlook 



  

credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur they could impact among other things interest costs for certain of our credit facilities our future borrowing costs access to capital markets vendor financing terms and future newstore leasing costs 

  

restricted cash 

  

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for general liability insurance and workers compensation insurance restricted cash and cash equivalents related to our continuing operations which are included in other current assets remained flat at 185 million and 184 million at january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively 

  

capital expenditures 

  

our capital expenditures typically include investments in our stores distribution capabilities and information technology enhancements including ecommerce during fiscal 2016 we invested 649 million in property and equipment primarily related to upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities and storerelated projects 

  

the following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions 



 

in fiscal 2017 we estimate cash capital expenditures of approximately 650 million to 700 million with the focus on retail store ecommerce and information technology projects 

debt and capital 

we have 350 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2016 the “2016 notes” 500 million principal amount of notes due august 1 2018 the “2018 notes” and 650 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2021 the “2021 notes” refer to note 5 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our 2016 notes 2018 notes and 2021 notes in march 2016 we paid the balance of the 2016 notes using existing cash resources 

other 

at january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  we had 178 million  and 69 million  respectively outstanding under financing lease obligations the increase in financing lease obligations was primarily due to renewals on existing leases 

share repurchases and dividends 

we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board we may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equitybased incentives including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan and optimizing our capital structure we consider several factors in determining whether to make share repurchases including among other things our cash needs the availability of funding our future business plans and the market price of our stock if we decide to make future share repurchases we expect that cash provided by future operating activities as well as available cash and cash equivalents will be the sources of funding for our share repurchases 

we have a 50 billion share repurchase program that was authorized by our board in june 2011 there is no expiration date governing the period over which we can repurchase shares under the june 2011 share repurchase program 

at the end of fiscal 2015 40 billion under this program was available for share repurchases in fiscal 2016  we repurchased and retired 328 million shares at a cost of 10 billion which included the use of an accelerated share repurchase asr contract refer to note 7 shareholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding the asr at the end of fiscal 2016  30 billion of the 50 billion  share repurchase program authorized by our board in june 2011 was available for future share repurchases repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares 

in fiscal 2004 our board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock a quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter the payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions during fiscal 2016  we made four cash dividend payments totaling 143 per share or 499 million in the aggregate during fiscal 2015 we made four cash dividend payments totaling 072 per share or 251 million in the aggregate 

on february 25 2016 we announced a plan to return capital to shareholders the plan includes a special dividend of 045 per share or approximately 145 million and a 22 increase in our regular quarterly dividend to 028 per share we plan to continue share repurchases under the june 2011 program with the intent to repurchase 10 billion in shares over the next two years 

other financial measures 

our current ratio calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities was 14 as of january 30 2016 compared to 15 at the end of fiscal 2015 the lower current ratio in fiscal 2016 was driven by an increase in current liabilities due to our 2016 notes being due in fiscal 2017 and a decrease in current assets due to a lower cash balance 

our debt to earnings ratio was 21  as of january 30 2016  compared to 13  as of january 31 2015  due primarily to a decrease in net earnings from continuing operations in fiscal 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio which includes capitalized operating lease obligations in its calculation was 26  and 28  as of january 30 2016  and january 31 2015  respectively the decrease in the ratio was due to a decrease in capitalized operating lease obligations and an increase in ebitdar 

our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for the most directly comparable ratio determined in accordance with gaap we have included this information in our mda as we view the adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness furthermore we believe that our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is important for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our longterm debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth we also believe our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to that of retailers who own rather than lease their stores our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity our capital structure our desire to own or to lease the location the owner’s desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders 

  

our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is calculated as follows 



  

the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio which excludes capitalized operating lease obligations from debt in the numerator of the calculation and does not adjust net earnings in the denominator of the calculation 

the following table presents a reconciliation of our debt to net earnings ratio to our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio for continuing operations  in millions 



 

offbalancesheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

other than operating leases we do not have any offbalancesheet financing a summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the contractual obligations table below additional information regarding our operating leases is available in item 2 properties  and note 8 leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year  in millions 



note for additional information refer to note 5   debt  note 8   leases  note 10   income taxes   and note 12   contingencies and commitments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8   financial statements and supplementary data   of this annual report on form 10k 

 

additionally we have 125 billion  in undrawn capacity on our credit facilities at january 30 2016  which if drawn upon would be included as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results these estimates require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board 

except where noted we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies for the areas described below 

inventory 

we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss adjustments markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net proceeds we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other 

disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding factors such as forecast consumer demand the promotional environment and technological obsolescence 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdown adjustments however if actual outcomes are different than we anticipated we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our markdown adjustment at january 30 2016  would have affected net earnings by approximately 9 million in fiscal 2016  

vendor allowances 

we receive allowances from certain vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements we treat a substantial majority of these allowances as an offset to the cost of the product or services provided sellthrough allowances are collected when inventory is sold to customers and recognized as a reduction in cost of sales at that time certain other types of funding most notably receiptbased allowances are collected when we take receipt of inventory and deferred as a reduction of inventory until inventory is sold the estimation of the deferral for these types of funding is complex and requires detailed analysis of factors such as product and vendor mix inventory turn and a large range of diverse allowance programs 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor funding deferral a 10 difference in our vendor funding deferral at january 30 2016  would have affected net earnings by approximately 21 million in fiscal 2016  

we also receive vendor allowances for achieving certain volume targets these vendor allowances are accrued as earned over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases amounts accrued throughout the program year could require adjustment if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated volume tiers are met we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowances to be received from our vendors since most volumebased programs apply to a calendar year or our fiscal year the amount of judgment required as of any fiscal year end is minimal 

property and equipment impairments 

property and equipment assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

when evaluating property and equipment assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis for a depreciable asset the new cost basis is depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset 

when reviewing property and equipment assets for impairment we group assets with other assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for assets deployed at store locations we review for impairment at the individual store level these reviews involve comparing the carrying value of all property and equipment located at each store to the net cash flow projections for each store in addition we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate for example a shared asset such as a distribution center would be evaluated by reference to the aggregate assets and projected cash flows of all areas of the businesses utilizing those shared assets 

our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values including estimating cash flows and useful lives and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to impairments that could be material we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate property and equipment asset impairment losses 

goodwill 

goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted cash flows or relative marketbased approaches if the fair value exceeds carrying value then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value 

the carrying value of goodwill at january 30 2016  was 425 million which related entirely to our domestic segment in fiscal 2016  we determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value was substantial we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

tax contingencies 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any time many tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we may record a liability for such exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate and would be recognized in the period of resolution 

revenue recognition 

the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the effects of future events 

returns – we recognize revenue net of estimated returns at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns with a corresponding reduction to revenue and cost of sales based on historical return data we believe that our estimate for sales returns which represents the estimated gross margin impact of returns is a reasonable reflection of future returns and financial impacts however if our estimates are significantly below or above the actual return amounts our reported revenue and cost of sales could be impacted a 10 difference in our returns reserve at january 30 2016 would have affected net earnings by approximately 2 million i n fiscal 2016 

gift card breakage – we sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores through our websites and through select third parties a liability is initially established for the value of the gift card when sold we recognize revenue from gift cards when the card is redeemed by the customer for unredeemed gift cards we recognize breakage when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is deemed remote and we determine that we do not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to a relevant jurisdiction we determine the breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns which show that after 24 months we can reasonably estimate breakage we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to record breakage however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

customer loyalty programs   –  we have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed or when using our cobranded credit cards points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases the value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed our estimate of the amount and timing of redemptions of certificates is based primarily on historical data a 10 difference in our customer loyalty point liability at january 30 2016 would have affected net earnings by approximately 13 million in fiscal 2016 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions of our revenue recognition critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material

for a description of new applicable accounting pronouncements see note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to changes in shortterm market interest rates and these changes in rates will impact our net interest expense our cash and shortterm investments generate interest income that will vary based on changes in shortterm interest rates and we have also swapped a portion of our fixedrate debt to floatingrate such that the interest expense on this debt will vary with shortterm interest rates refer to note 5 debt    and note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our interest rate swaps 

as of january 30 2016 we had 33 billion  of cash and shortterm investments and 750 million  of debt that has been swapped to floating rate therefore we had net cash and shortterm investments of 26 billion  generating income which is exposed to interest rate changes as of january 30 2016 a 50 basis point increase in shortterm interest rates would lead to an estimated 13 million  reduction in net interest expense and conversely a 50 basis point decrease in shortterm interest rates would lead to an estimated 13 million  increase in net interest expense 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international segment operations on a limited basis we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecast inventory purchases recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our canadian operations our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows as well as of the net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments which generally have terms of up to 12 months refer to note 6 derivative instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our these instruments 

the strength of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar and mexican peso compared to the prioryear period had a negative overall impact on our revenue as these currencies translated into fewer us dollars we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue in fiscal 2016  of approximately 534 million and a net favorable impact on earnings of 20 million  in fiscal 2015 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately 308 million and an unfavorable impact on earnings of 4 million

our stores in mexico have distribution methods similar to that of our us best buy stores 

suppliers and inventory

competition 

our competitors are primarily traditional storebased retailers multichannel retailers internetbased businesses and vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products directly to the consumer 

some of our competitors have low cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price in addition in the us onlineonly operators are exempt from collecting sales taxes in certain states we believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are reevaluated at both the state and federal levels we carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities in addition we have a pricematching policy in the us that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators in order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships 

in addition to price we believe our ability to deliver a high quality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage we believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people integrated online and store channels broad product assortment range of focused service and support offerings distinct store formats brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage 

environmental matters 

best buy is committed to creating a thriving business while lessening our environmental impact in the us consumers recycle more electronics through best buy than any other retailer in fiscal 2015 we collected more than 126 million pounds of consumer electronics and 110 million pounds of appliances helping us meet our goal of collecting one billion pounds set in 2009 the recycling program remains an important offering in supporting our customers communities and the environment 

we offer a large selection of energyefficient products which help our customers save money by using less energy best buy’s us customers purchased more than 25 million energy star® certified products in fiscal 2015 and realized utility bill savings of more than 71 million these energy savings equate to over 900 million pounds of co 2  avoidance or the equivalent of removing more than 86000 cars from us roads 

we are continuously working to make our locations more sustainable and to increase efficiency within our supply chain in calendar 2010 we set a goal of reducing our absolute carbon emissions in north america by 20 by the year 2020 over a 2009 baselineto date these energy efficiency measures reduced more than 200000 metric tons of co 2 emissions and helped us to exceed our goal of 20 

we are not aware of any federal state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment that have materially affected or are reasonably expected to materially affect our net earnings or competitive position or have resulted or are reasonably expected to result in material capital expenditures see item 1a risk factors  for additional discussion 

number of employees 

at the end of fiscal 2015 we employed approximately 125000  fulltime parttime and seasonal employees in the us canada mexico and our sourcing office in china we consider our employee relations to be good we offer our employees a wide array of companypaid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements which we believe are competitive in the aggregate relative to others in our industry

 item 1a risk factors 

described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10k and in our other public disclosures the risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial all forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below 

we face strong competition from traditional storebased retailers multichannel retailers internetbased businesses our vendors and other forms of retail commerce which directly affects our sales and margins 

the retail business is highly competitive price is of primary importance to customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital technology the ability of consumers to compare prices on a realtime basis puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices to attract customers we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers as well as certain of our vendors who offer their products directly to consumers some of our competitors have greater market presence and financial resources than we do the retail industry continues to experience a trend toward an increase in sales initiated online and using mobile applications and some onlineonly businesses are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all us states which can negatively impact the ability of multichannel retailers to be price competitive online and multichannel retailers are also increasing their focus on delivery services with customers increasingly seeking faster guaranteed delivery times and lowprice or free shipping our ability to be competitive on delivery times and delivery cost depends on many factors and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery options could negatively impact the demand for our products in addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service utilizing a multichannel platform our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors changes in the levels of these various competitive factors may have a significant impact on consumer demand for our products and services and the margins we can generate from them 

failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner could result in a decline in our sales 

our success depends on our vendors and our ability to successfully introduce new products services and technologies to consumers including among other factors the frequency of product and service innovations how accurately we predict consumer preferences the level of consumer demand the availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment consumers continue to have a wide variety of choices in terms of how and where they purchase the products and services we sell failure to accurately predict and adapt to constantly changing technology and consumer preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

macroeconomic pressures in the us and key international markets could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results 

some of our products and services are viewed by some consumers to be discretionary items rather than necessities as a result our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending consumer confidence employment levels oil prices interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions and costs for items such as fuel and food can adversely affect consumers demand for the products and services that we offer our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors 

if we fail to attract develop and retain qualified employees including employees in key positions our business and operating results may be harmed 

our performance is highly dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team and other key employees our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce the turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new employees factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or failure to retain key employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities in addition a significant amount of turnover of senior management employees with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry may negatively impact our operations 

consumer demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition 

we operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation we believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success the proliferation of webbased social media means that consumer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty lower employee retention and productivity vendor relationship issues and other factors all of which could materially affect our profitability 

our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies 

we operate in a highlycompetitive and everchanging commercial environment our success is dependent on our ability to identify develop and execute appropriate strategies within this environment our current strategy includes transformational change to many areas of our business including our online and instore customer experience our distribution system employee training and engagement partnership with our vendors retail execution services and cost control we may experience challenges in achieving the goals we have set and it is possible that our strategies may prove to be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in future periods it is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies that the strategies we will implement expose us to additional risks or that strategies that have been successful in the past will fail to produce the desired results our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to design and execute appropriate strategies the market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further information regarding our strategies 

failure to effectively manage our property portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 

effective management of our large property portfolio is critical to our success we primarily secure properties through operating leases with thirdparty landlords if we fail to negotiate appropriate terms for new leases we enter into we may incur lease costs that are excessive and cause operating margins to be below acceptable levels we may also make term commitments that are too long or too short without the option to exit early or extend the availability of suitable new property locations may also hinder our ability to maintain or grow our operations factors such as the condition of local property markets availability of lease financing taxes zoning and environmental issues and competitive actions may impact the availability for suitable property 

we have closed stores and we may close additional stores or other facilities in the future for leased property the financial impact of exiting a property can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local property market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors if these factors are unfavorable to us then the costs of exiting a property can be significant when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we remain at risk of default by the tenant and the impact of such defaults on our future results could be significant 

failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

certain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature demand for our products and services is difficult to predict which makes it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income the competitiveness in our industry and increasing price transparency mean that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever as a result we must continuously focus on managing our cost structure failure to manage our labor and benefit rates advertising and marketing expenses operating leases other store expenses or indirect spending could severely impair our ability to maintain our price competitiveness while achieving acceptable levels of profitability 

our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms 

we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit and our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders these factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue growth opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 

in fiscal 2015 moodys investors service inc maintained its longterm credit rating at baa2 and revised its outlook from negative to stable fitch ratings ltd upgraded its longterm credit rating from bb to bb maintaining its outlook as stable standard  poors ratings services maintained their longterm credit rating at bb with a stable outlook 

future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact our access to capital markets the borrowing cost for future financings and the perception of our credit risk by lenders and other third parties our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 

any downgrade may result in higher interest costs for certain of our credit facilities and could result in higher interest costs on future financings in addition downgrades may impact our ability to obtain adequate financing including via trade payables with our vendors customers inclination to shop with us or purchase gift cards or extended warranties may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of our credit ratings 

failure to effectively manage strategic ventures or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business 

from time to time our strategy has involved and may in the future involve entering into new business ventures and strategic alliances as well as making acquisitions assessing a potential opportunity can be based on assumptions that might not ultimately prove to be correct in addition the amount of information we can obtain about a potential opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures strategic alliances and acquisitions will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned the success of these opportunities is also largely dependent on the current and future participation working relationship and strategic vision of the business venture or strategic alliance partners which can change following a transaction integrating new businesses stores and concepts can be a difficult task cultural differences in some markets into which we may expand or into which we may introduce new retail concepts may not be as well received by customers as originally anticipated these types of transactions may divert our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities and may also negatively impact our return on invested capital further implementing new partnerships strategic alliances or business ventures may also impair our relationships with our vendors or other strategic partners we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting and deficiencies in information technology systems in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could suffer materially likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to impairment of the associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

failure to protect the integrity security and confidentiality of our employee and customer data could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our customers 

the use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state federal and international levels we are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information increasing costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology and qualified staff the costs of compliance and costs resulting from fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially additionally the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks including the use of cashless payments while we take significant steps to protect this information lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures as a result unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate employee customer and other confidential data there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation which may in turn have a negative impact on our sales and may expose us to material costs penalties and compensation claims in addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk 

our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors in fiscal 2015 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 73 of the merchandise we purchased with 5 suppliers – apple samsung hewlettpackard sony and lg electronics – representing approximately 47 of total merchandise purchased we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise we depend on our vendors for among other things appropriate allocation of merchandise development of compelling assortments of products operation of vendorfocused shopping experiences within our stores acceptance of product returns approval and payment for factory warranty claims and funding for various forms of promotional programs to varying degrees our vendors may be able to leverage their financial strength customer popularity or alternative channels including in some instances our vendors’ own retail locations or websites to influence these factors and other factors to our commercial disadvantage such changes could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability 

we are also dependent on mobile network carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections the competitive strategies utilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our revenues and margins for example if carriers change customer upgrade terms monthly fee plans cancellation fees or service levels the volume of upgrades and new contracts we sign with customers may be reduced adversely affecting our revenues and profitability in addition many of our carriers also serve customers through their own stores websites mobile applications and call centers if customers choose to upgrade or make new connections through carriers directly rather than through us our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected we could also experience declines in revenue and profitability if our carriers decided not to allow us to market their products or services 

we have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us political or financial instability merchandise quality issues product safety concerns trade restrictions work stoppages port delays tariffs foreign currency exchange rates transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

changes in the demand for our service offerings could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 

our customer promises include provision of a full range of services to complement our product offerings including extended warranties delivery installation technical support network setup and repair services many of these service offerings are through our geek squad brand which provides an opportunity to deliver superior customer service and drives incremental revenue and income – often through attachment of these services at the point of sale as customers increasingly migrate to websites and mobile applications to initiate transactions there is a risk that we are unsuccessful in effectively promoting the benefits of these complementary service offerings through those channels if we fail to design and market these services 

effectively to our customers or fail to meet our customers’ expectations in the execution of these services our revenues and income could be adversely affected 

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events could adversely affect our operating results 

the threat or occurrence of one or more natural disasters or other extreme weather events whether as a result of climate change or otherwise the threat or outbreak of terrorism civil unrest or other hostilities or conflicts could materially adversely affect our financial performance these events may result in damage to or destruction or closure of our stores distribution centers and other properties such events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and other properties can modify consumer purchasing patterns and decrease disposable income and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network 

our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results 

sales of our exclusive brands products which primarily include insignia modal dynex init platinum and rocketfish branded products represent an important component of our revenue most of these products are manufactured by contracted manufacturers based in southeastern asia this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could materially adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

 

maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate sales and achieve acceptable margins failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the margins we are able to generate from them 

we are subject to certain statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are 

 12 

 

regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has grown in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operating costs associated with compliance additionally defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters 

changes to the national labor relations act or other laborrelated statutes or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model 

the national labor relations board continually considers changes to labor regulations many of which could significantly impact the nature of labor relations in the us and how union organizing and union elections are conducted the us department of labor is considering new regulations requiring companies to publicly report the use and associated expense of external resources providing labor relations guidance and advice as of january 31 2015 none of our us operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements changes in laborrelated statutes or regulations could increase the percentage of elections won by unions if any segment of best buy’s operations became unionized it could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our operations 

economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect the profitability of our promotional financing and credit card arrangements and our promotional financing offerings and therefore our operating results 

  

we offer promotional financing and credit cards issued by a thirdparty bank that manages and directly extends credit to our customers the cardholders can receive low or nointerest promotional financing on qualifying purchases total revenues from these programs accounted for approximately 20 of our revenue in fiscal 2015 we view these arrangements as a way to generate incremental sales of products and services from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment in addition we earn profitshare income from our banking partners based on the performance of the credit card portfolio and the amount of income we earn in this regard is subject to numerous factors such as the volume of credit card or financing transactions bad debt rates interest rates the regulatory environment and expenses of operating the program adverse changes to any of these factors could impair our ability to offer these programs to customers and reduce our ability to earn income from sharing in the profits of the program 

  

we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems we rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing staff planning and deployment website offerings financial management and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business could significantly disrupt our business and cause for example higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation 

in addition we utilize complex information technology platforms to operate our websites and mobile applications disruptions to these services such as those caused by unforeseen traffic levels or other technical difficulties could cause us to forego material revenues and adversely affect our reputation with consumers 

  

we utilize thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our business operations 

  

we engage key thirdparty business partners to support various functions of our business including but not limited to information technology human resource operations customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards customer warranty and insurance programs any material disruption in our relationship with key thirdparty business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our ability to continue operations particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods 

  

we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

  

approximately onethird of our revenue and more than onehalf of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters product sourcing issues failure or interruption of management information systems disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors or adverse economic conditions in our fourth fiscal quarter could have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

our revenues and margins are highly sensitive to developments in products and services 

  

the consumer electronics industry involves constant innovation and evolution of products and services offered to consumers the following examples demonstrate the impact this can have on our business 

  

 

many of the factors described above are not controllable by us the factors can have a material adverse impact on our relevance to the consumer and the demand for products and services we have traditionally offered it is possible that these and similar changes could materially affect our revenues and profitability 

our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above as well as to risks associated with the legislative judicial regulatory political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

  

we operate international retail locations in canada and mexico in addition we have a presence in various other foreign countries including bermuda china germany hong kong japan luxembourg the republic of mauritius the netherlands taiwan turks and caicos and the uk during fiscal 2015 our international segments operations generated 11 of our revenue our future operating results in these countries and in other countries or regions throughout the world where we may operate in the future could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including political conditions economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints foreign trade rules and monetary and fiscal policies both of the us and of other countries in addition foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future revenues earnings and cash flows from international operations and could materially adversely affect our reported financial performance 

  

our international segments operations face other risks as well including the costs and difficulties of managing international operations greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us and potential adverse tax consequences the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by differences in culture laws and regulations there is a heightened risk that we misjudge the response of consumers in foreign markets to our product and service assortments marketing and promotional strategy and store and website designs among other factors and this could adversely impact the results of these operations and the viability of these ventures 

failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price 

  

we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results for future periods although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided if our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results unless otherwise noted transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude our mda is presented in seven sections 

 

our mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we are a leading provider of technology products services and solutions we offer expert service at unbeatable price more than 15 billion times a year to the consumers small business owners and educators who visit our stores engage with geek squad agents or use our websites or mobile applications we have retail and online operations in the us canada and mexico we operate two reportable segments domestic and international the domestic segment is comprised of all operations within the us and its territories the international segment is comprised of all operations outside the us and its territories 

our business like that of many retailers is seasonal historically we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico while consumers view some of the products and services we offer as essential others are viewed as discretionary purchases consequently our financial results are susceptible to changes in consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors including unemployment consumer credit availability and the condition of the housing market additionally there are other factors that directly impact our performance such as product lifecycles including the introduction and pace of adoption of new technology and the competitive retail environment as a result of these factors predicting our future revenue and net earnings is difficult 

throughout this mda we refer to comparable sales our comparable sales calculation compares revenue from stores websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months as well as revenue related to certain other comparable sales channels for a particular period to the corresponding period in the prior year relocated stores as well as remodeled expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition the portion of the calculation of comparable sales attributable to our international segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the calculation of comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations comparable online sales are included in our comparable sales calculation the method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry as a result our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers methods 

in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment’s operating results from local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prioryear period’s currency exchange rates we use this method to calculate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for all countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

in our discussions of the operating results below we sometimes refer to the impact of net new stores on our results of operations the key factors that dictate the impact that the net new stores have on our operating results include i store opening and closing decisions ii the size and format of new stores as we operate stores ranging from approximately 1000 square feet to approximately 50000 square feet iii the length of time the stores were open during the period and iv the overall success of new store launches 

this mda includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap as well as certain adjusted or nongaap financial measures such as nongaap operating income nongaap net earnings from continuing operations nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted debt to earnings before goodwill impairment interest income taxes depreciation amortization and rent ebitdar ratio generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

we believe that the nongaap measures described above provide meaningful supplemental information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management makes standard adjustments for items such as restructuring charges goodwill impairments nonrestructuring asset impairments and gains or losses on investments as well as adjustments for other items that may arise during the period and have a meaningful impact on comparability to measure adjusted operating income we removed the impact of the second quarter of fiscal 2014 lcdrelated legal settlements nonrestructuring asset impairments restructuring charges and goodwill impairments from our calculation of operating income adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was calculated by removing the aftertax impact of operating income adjustments and the gains on investments as well as the income tax impacts of reorganizing certain european legal entities and the best buy europe sale from our calculation of net earnings from continuing operations to measure adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations we excluded the per share impact of net earnings adjustments from our calculation of diluted earnings per share management believes our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is an important indicator of our creditworthiness because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible 

to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures within our discussion of consolidated performance below provide a more complete understanding of our business we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

business strategy 

in the fall of 2012 we laid out for investors the state of our business and summarized the challenges we faced by articulating two fundamental problems 1 declining comparable sales and 2 declining margins to address these problems and achieve our goal of becoming the leading authority and destination for technology products and services we unveiled our renew blue transformation effort incorporating the following five pillars 

 

fiscal 2015 was the second full fiscal year in our renew blue transformation and we continued to make progress against the two main problems we had to solve that we outlined in november of 2012 – declining comparable sales and declining operating margins in fiscal 2015 we stabilized comparable sales on a full year basis and delivered incremental nongaap sga reductions of approximately 420 million resulting in nongaap operating income rate expansion of 08 of revenue and a 26 increase in nongaap diluted earnings per share to 260 we also ended the year with 39 billion in cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments versus 26 billion last year 

these results reflect the cumulative progress since 2012 that we have made against our renew blue transformation initiatives to date we have 1 improved our net promoter score nps by 450 basis points 2 rolled out 71 pacific kitchen and home and 34 magnolia design center storeswithinastore in addition to our enhanced vendor experiences 3 implemented shipfromstore across the whole chain driving significant growth for our business 4 increased our domestic online penetration from 70 to 98 5 gained share across multiple categories 6 delivered 102 billion in cost reductions exceeding our 1 billion target 7 divested our underperforming european and chinese businesses and 8 intensively managed our capital resources and significantly strengthened our balance sheet 

in light of this progress we announced a plan on march 2 2015 to return excess capital to shareholders this plan allows us to continue to invest in the growth of our business and preserve a strong balance sheet and includes 1 a special onetime dividend of 051 per share or approximately 180 million related to the net aftertax proceeds from lcdrelated legal settlements received in the last three fiscal years 2 a 21 increase in our regular quarterly dividend to 023 per share and 3 the resumption of share repurchases with the intent to repurchase 1 billion worth of shares over the next three years 

as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond it is imperative that we continue to focus on driving comparable sales and improving operating margins while funding investments in our future we are pursuing a strategy that is focused on delivering advice service and convenience at competitive prices to our customers within this strategy we are focused on driving a number of growth initiatives around key product categories life events and services to drive these initiatives we are pursuing and investing in the transformation of our key functions and processes the initiatives we intend to pursue in fiscal 2016 reflect our continued execution against the 24month road map that we outlined a year ago 

the first initiative is merchandising  our goal is to create a compelling assortment online and in the stores with a superior endtoend customer experience that yields enhanced financial returns in pursuit of that goal we plan to 1 capitalize on the ultra high definition television cycle through bestinclass merchandising assortment and customer experience including opening approximately 20 additional magnolia design center storeswithinastore to end fiscal 2016 with 78 2 accelerate our expansion in growing categories with structural barriers to entry – like large appliances and mobile – including opening approximately 60 additional pacific kitchen  home storeswithinastore to end fiscal 2016 with 177 and extending our installment billing selling capability to online 3 grow our connected home and health and wearables businesses through an optimized assortment and an improved multichannel customer experience 4 increase our exclusive brand and private label assortments 5 expand our secondary market growth strategy to offer consumers better access to these types of products and improve our margin recovery on returned replaced and damaged products and 6 apply more science behind our promotional and pricing strategies 

we will also expand our programs to capture customers at the time of key life events and build longterm relationships with them including our new mover program and our wedding gift registry which we launched in february 2015 

the second initiative is marketing  which provides crucial support for our merchandising growth opportunities in marketing we will 1 accelerate our targeted marketing programs by leveraging our customer database to expand personalization beyond email campaigns 2 extend the personalization of our targeted email campaigns by dynamically serving relevant landing pages when customers click through to our website 3 continue the evolution of our marketing spend from analog and mass to digital and personalized mediums such as search mobile devices and retargeting and 4 continue to increase the number of addressable emails in our customer database 

the next initiative on our road map is online  our goal is to serve our customers based on how when and where they want to be served and capture online share in pursuit of that goal we will continue to develop true omnichannel experiences including improving the online visibility of returned opened box inventory 2 extending our installment billing selling capability online 3 enhancing the online experience for appliance purchases 4 expanding capabilities for life events like the wedding registry and wish list and 5 providing an integrated geek squad customer experience across channels and devices and driving increased attach rates we will also be continuing the transformation of our ecommerce technology platform and accelerating the transformation of our mobile customer experience which we will support through our new technology development center in seattle similar to general industry trends our traffic from mobile phones is growing much faster than traditional desktop traffic and we are increasing our mobile investment accordingly we believe it is imperative that we engage mobile customers with improved and streamlined access to essential rich product information during the discovery research and checkout processes 

the next initiative is retail stores  in our retail stores we are building on the momentum from our success in fiscal 2015 and will be driving increased sales effectiveness and payroll leverage through focus on the individual sales productivity of our associates enhancing our instore customer experience from both an expert service and physical environment perspective including expanding product training for associates and driving growth by implementing market plans that are tailored to specific geographies 

services  is the next initiative on our road map   in fiscal 2015 we significantly reduced our legacy cost structure and improved our servicesrelated nps we also launched a loss and theft mobile phone insurance program and more complete technology support bundles despite these accomplishments however revenue has been declining largely due to lower attach rates of traditional extended warranties and lower mobile revenue due to our success in decreasing claim severity and frequency which is an operational positive in fiscal 2016 we will be focused on 1 continuing to transform our traditional service offerings to better address customer needs 2 continuing to improve our delivery and installation experience 3 increasing the investment in marketing and selling our services offerings and 4 integrating the geek squad experience into bestbuycom to provide an enhanced service experience to our customers and to increase online attach rates 

the next initiative on our road map is supply chain  our goal is to leverage our network and improve our customer experience with increased inventory availability improved speed to customer and improved home delivery and installation capabilities for our large cube assortments in pursuit of these goals over the next 12 months we will unlock additional inventory for shipfromstore continue to pursue cost efficiencies through technology enhancements including replacement of our warehouse technology systems drive growth in large appliances and large televisions by leveraging new regional inventory capabilities and invest in improving our home delivery and installation services nps 

the last initiative on our road map is our cost structure  through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we eliminated a total of 102 billion in annualized costs which exceeded our target of 1 billion in fiscal 2016 we are launching phase two of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization program with a target of approximately 400 million in annualized savings over three years including the remaining benefit of approximately 250 million from our previously discussed returns replacements and damages opportunity these savings because they are structural in nature are not expected to begin until the second half of fiscal 2016 and will be driven by streamlined processes and operational efficiencies that will be primarily enabled through investments in systems 

we expect however that these incremental savings will be significantly offset by the investments we need to make to fund our growth initiatives in fiscal 2016 we expect these incremental investments to total approximately 100 million to 120 million or 017 to 021 in diluted eps and fall into three main buckets 1 the customer experience online and in our retail stores 2 information technology and 3 marketing we also expect to increase our fiscal 2016 capital expenditures to approximately 650 to 700 million from 550 million in fiscal 2015 

fiscal 2016 trends 

the strategy outlined above is the foundation of our fiscal 2016 operating plan and we are confident in our ability to execute against it as we have demonstrated this past year however we will also be facing industry and economic pressures which we expect to impact our business including 1 more rapidly declining average selling prices in key product categories 2 weak industry demand in certain product categories 3 declining demand and increasing pricing pressures for our extended warranties and 4 increasingly competitive and costly customer service expectations like free and faster shipping 

to win against this backdrop investing now is imperative while these investments will put pressure on our fiscal 2016 operating income rate we believe they leverage our executional momentum and will allow us to build a differentiated customer experience and a foundation for longterm success in fiscal 2016 we expect the financial impact of the aforementioned investments and economic pressures in the first quarter and continue throughout the year 

from a revenue perspective fiscal 2016 first and second quarter enterprise revenue and comparable sales growth excluding the estimated impact of installment billing is expected to be in the range of flat to negative lowsingle digits this change in trend versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is primarily driven by ongoing material declines in the tablet category in addition to typical holiday momentum around highprofile giftable products not continuing postholiday we will also be anniversarying approximately 80 basis points of enterprise growth in the first half of fiscal 2015 driven by the chainwide rollout of shipfromstore 

from a nongaap operating income rate perspective we expect fiscal 2016 first and second quarter to be down approximately 03 of revenue to 05 of revenue including lapping fiscal 2015 first quarter 15basis point benefit associated with our credit card agreement this decline reflects the economic and growth pressures outlined above the investments we are making to drive our fiscal 2016 growth initiatives and our anticipated sga inflation additionally we expect the fiscal 2016 first and second quarter nongaap continuing operations effective income tax rate to be in the range of 39 to 40 

canada 

in march 2015 we made a decision to consolidate future shop and best buy stores and websites in canada under the best buy brand in order to strengthen our position as canada’s leading provider of consumer electronics products services and solutions as a result of this decision we also reviewed our real estate footprint in canada to address the fact that a significant number of future shop and best buy stores are located in close proximity to each other the result of this review is the permanent closure of 66 future shop locations and the conversion of 65 future shop stores to the best buy brand following this consolidation we will continue to have a strong store presence in all major markets in canada 

looking ahead investments up to 160 million will be made in best buy stores and bestbuyca to build a leading multichannel customer experience this multifaceted strategy will include 1 launching major home appliances in all stores 2 working with our vendor partners to bring their products to life in a more compelling way 3 increasing our staffing levels to better serve our customers 4 investing in the online shopping experience for example by expanding instore pickup areas for online customers and launching a shipfromstore program making instore inventory available to online customers across the country 

as a result of these changes we expect to increase our capital spending by up to 160 million over the next 12 to 24 months in addition we expect to record restructuring charges and nonrestructuring impairments in the range of 200 million to 280 million or a gaap diluted earnings per share impact of 041 to 058 we expect that the majority of these charges will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 the total charges includes approximately 140 million to 180 million of cash charges – primarily related to future rent obligations and severance – that will be paid over the next 5 years 

we also expect our fiscal 2016 gaap and nongaap diluted earnings per share to be negatively impacted in the range of 010 to 020 due primarily to a temporary increase in operational expenses associated with consolidation activities and store disruptions resulting from our investments to support the best buy multichannel customer experience due to the transitional nature of the majority of these costs we do not expect this negative earnings per share impact to continue into future years

domestic segment installment billing plans 

in april 2014 we began to sell installment billing plans offered by mobile carriers to our customers to complement the more traditional twoyear plans while the two types of contracts have broadly similar overall economics installment billing plans typically generate higher revenues due to higher proceeds for devices and higher cost of sales due to lower device subsidies as we increase our mix of installment billing plans there is an associated increase in revenue and cost of goods sold and a decrease in gross profit rate with gross profit dollars relatively unaffected we estimate that our fiscal 2015 enterprise and domestic comparable sales of 05 and 10 respectively both include a 05 of revenue impact from this classification difference the impact on our consolidated gross profit rate was immaterial

income tax expense increased to 388 million in fiscal 2014 12month compared to a tax expense of 263 million in the prioryear period our etr was 358 in fiscal 2014 12month compared to 71523 in fiscal 2013 11month excluding the impact of the goodwill impairments which are not tax deductible the etr would have been 426 in fiscal 2013 11month the etr in fiscal 2014 12month was lower than in fiscal 2013 11month excluding the goodwill impairments as fiscal 2013 11month was higher than normal as a result of decreased tax benefits from foreign operations which were due primarily to a decrease in foreign earnings and a valuation allowance on us federal foreign tax credits 

our consolidated effective tax rate is impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower statutory rates than the 35 us federal statutory rate changes in the proportion of our consolidated taxable earnings originating in foreign jurisdictions impact our consolidated effective rate our foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax 

discontinued operations 

discontinued operations consists primarily of best buy europe and five star in our international segment as well as mindshift in our domestic segment 

the loss from discontinued operations was 11 million in fiscal 2015 compared to a loss of 172 million in fiscal 2014 the decrease in the loss yearoveryear was primarily due to the impairment of our investment in best buy europe as well as the loss on the sale of mindshift in fiscal 2014 the loss from discontinued operations of 172 million in fiscal 2014 12month compared to a loss of 161 million in fiscal 2013 11month the loss in fiscal 2013 11month was primarily due to the writeoff of goodwill related to our five star reporting unit 

impact of inflation and changing prices 

highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and services and on our expenses in addition price deflation and the continued commoditization of certain technology products limited our ability to increase our gross profit rate 

nongaap financial measures 

the periods used for analysis of nongaap financial performance represent the periods that management used internally to assess performance as a result of the change in our fiscal year in fiscal 2013 some of the periods included in this section of our mda differ from the audited periods included in our consolidated statements of earnings and as such these periods are also different than those analyzed within the results of operations section of the mda 

the following table reconciles operating income net earnings and diluted earnings per share for the periods presented from continuing operations gaap financial measures to nongaap operating income nongaap net earnings and nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations nongaap financial measures for the periods presented  in millions except per share amounts 



 

nongaap operating income increased 334 million in 2015 compared to 2014 and nongaap operating income as a percent of revenue increased to 37 the increase in nongaap operating income was driven by sga cost reductions in both segments primarily due to the realization of our renew blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management partially offset by a decline in revenue in our international segment the increase in nongaap operating income resulted in a 

yearoveryear increase in nongaap net earnings from continuing operations and nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2015 compared to the prioryear period 

in 2014 nongaap operating income decreased 311 million compared to 2013 the decrease in nongaap operating income was primarily driven by the extra week of operations in 2013 and a decrease in the gross profit rate adjusted to exclude lcdrelated legal settlements in the second quarter of 2014 this decrease was partially offset by lower sga spending due to the realization of renew blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management in both the domestic and international segments these same factors contributed to the yearoveryear decreases in nongaap net earnings from continuing operations and nongaap diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2014 compared to the prioryear period 

liquidity and capital resources 

summary 

we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements depend on key variables including the level of investment required to support our business strategies the performance of our business capital expenditures credit facilities and shortterm borrowing arrangements and working capital management capital expenditures are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which to a large extent we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our renew blue transformation 

the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments at january 31 2015 and february 1 2014  in millions 



the increase in cash and cash equivalents from february 1 2014 was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities partially offset by capital expenditures and dividend payments 

working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities was 40 billion at january 31 2015 an increase from 30 billion at february 1 2014 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions 



operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to improved management of working capital in fiscal 2015 additionally in fiscal 2014 there were larger cash outflows from accounts payable following unusually high balances at the end of fiscal 2013 due to timing of inventory receipts and payments 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month was primarily due to increased cash outflows for accounts payable partially offset by improved inventory management and increased cash inflow from receivables 

investing activities 

the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to increased purchases of shortterm investments in fiscal 2015 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and proceeds from the disposition of mindshift partially offset by purchases of shortterm investments in fiscal 2014 12month 

financing activities 

the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to decreased borrowing and decreased proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from the exercise of employee stock options 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month was primarily due to increased borrowing increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from the exercise of employee stock options and the lack of share repurchases in fiscal 2014 12month 

sources of liquidity 

funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and our credit facilities are our most significant sources of liquidity we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations and to finance anticipated capital investments and strategic initiatives however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to limit our spending there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing if necessary on favorable terms 

on june 30 2014 we entered into a new 125 billion fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility the fiveyear facility agreement with a syndicate of banks that expires in june 2019 the fiveyear facility agreement replaced the previous 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility which was originally scheduled to expire in october 2016 but was terminated on june 30 2014 at january 31 2015 we had no borrowings outstanding under the fiveyear facility agreement refer to note 5 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our credit facilities 

our ability to access our revolving credit facility under the fiveyear facility agreement is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the facility including financial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios at january 31 2015 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt it would likely constitute an event of default under our facilities as well 

an interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense to fixed charges our interest coverage ratio calculated as reported in exhibit no 121 of this annual report on form 10k was 508 and 406 in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 respectively 

  

our credit ratings and outlooks at march 23 2015  are summarized below on september 3 2014 fitch ratings limited fitch upgraded its longterm credit rating from bb to bb with a stable outlook on july 2 2014 moodys investors service inc moodys reaffirmed its baa2 longterm credit rating and changed its outlook from negative to stable the rating and outlook from standard  poors rating services standard  poors remain consistent with those disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended february 1 2014 



  

credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur they could impact among other things interest costs for certain of our credit facilities our future borrowing costs access to capital markets vendor financing terms and future newstore leasing costs 

  

restricted cash 

  

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for general liability insurance and workers compensation insurance restricted cash and cash equivalents related to our continuing operations which are included in other current assets remained flat at 184 million and 182 million at january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  respectively 

  

capital expenditures 

  

our capital expenditures typically include investments in our stores distribution capabilities and information technology enhancements including ecommerce during fiscal 2015 we invested 551 million excluding five star in property and equipment primarily related to upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities and storerelated projects 

  

the following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years  in millions 



 

in fiscal 2016 we estimate capital expenditures of approximately 650 million to 700 million with the focus on retail store ecommerce and information technology projects 

debt and capital 

we have 350 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2016 the “2016 notes” 500 million principal amount of notes due august 1 2018 the “2018 notes” and 650 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2021 the “2021 notes” refer to note 5 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our 2016 notes 2018 notes and 2021 notes 

other 

at january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 we had 69 million  and 95 million  respectively outstanding under financing lease obligations 

share repurchases and dividends 

from time to time we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board we may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equitybased 

incentives including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan and optimizing our capital structure we consider several factors in determining whether to make share repurchases including among other things our cash needs the availability of funding our future business plans and the market price of our stock if we decide to make future share repurchases we expect that cash provided by future operating activities as well as available cash and cash equivalents will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program 

in fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014 we did not repurchase or retire any shares in fiscal 2013 11month we repurchased and retired 63 million  shares at a cost of 122 million  at the end of fiscal 2015  12month 40 billion  of the 50 billion  share repurchase program authorized by our board in june 2011 was available for future share repurchases repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares 

in fiscal 2004 our board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock a quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter the payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions during fiscal 2015 we made four cash dividend payments totaling 072 per share or 251 million in the aggregate 

on march 3 2015 we announced a plan to return capital to shareholders the plan includes a special onetime dividend of 051 per share or approximately 180 million and a 21 increase in our regular quarterly dividend to 023 per share we plan to resume share repurchases under the june 2011 program with the intent to repurchase 10 billion in shares over the next three years 

other financial measures 

our debt to earnings ratio was 13  as of january 31 2015 compared to 24  as of february 1 2014 due primarily to an increase in net earnings in the 12 months ended january 31 2015 compared to the prior year our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio which includes capitalized operating lease obligations in its calculation was 28  and 32  as of january 31 2015 and february 1 2014 respectively the decrease in the ratio was due to a decrease in capitalized operating lease obligations and an increase in ebitdar 

our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for the most directly comparable ratio determined in accordance with gaap we have included this information in our mda as we view the adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness furthermore we believe that our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is important for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our longterm debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth we also believe our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to that of retailers who own rather than lease their stores our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity our capital structure our desire to own or to lease the location the owner’s desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders 

  

our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is calculated as follows 

  



  

the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio which excludes capitalized operating lease obligations from debt in the numerator of the calculation and does not adjust net earnings in the denominator of the calculation 

the following table presents a reconciliation of our debt to net earnings ratio to our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio for continuing operations  in millions 



 

offbalancesheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

other than operating leases we do not have any offbalancesheet financing a summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the contractual obligations table below additional information regarding our operating leases is available in item 2 properties  and note 8 leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year  in millions 



note for additional information refer to note 5   debt  note 8   leases  note 10   income taxes   and note 12   contingencies and commitments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8   financial statements and supplementary data   of this annual report on form 10k 

 46 

 

additionally we have 125 billion  in undrawn capacity on our credit facilities at january 31 2015  which if drawn upon would be included as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board 

except where noted we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies for the areas described below 

inventory 

we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss adjustments markdown adjustments reflect the excess of the cost over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging forecast consumer demand the promotional environment and technological obsolescence 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdowns however if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our markdown adjustment at january 31 2015 would have affected net earnings by approximately 8 million in fiscal 2015 

inventory loss adjustments reflect anticipated physical inventory losses eg due to theft that have occurred since the last physical inventory inventory loss adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors including historical results and current inventory loss trends our inventory loss estimate is verified by ongoing physical inventory counts historically our annual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss adjustment however if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate we 

may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our physical inventory loss estimate at january 31 2015 would have affected net earnings by approximately 6 million in fiscal 2015 

vendor allowances 

we receive allowances from certain vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements we treat such allowances as an offset to the cost of the product or services provided receiptbased funds represent one form of our vendor allowances receiptbased funds are generally determined at an agreed percentage of purchases and are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories the deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold we estimate the amount of vendor funding to be deferred and recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on detailed analysis of inventory turns and applicable vendor funding rates 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor funding deferral however if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially either positively or negatively impact our gross profit rate and inventory a 10 difference in our vendor funding deferral at january 31 2015 would have affected net earnings by approximately 20 million in fiscal 2015 

we also receive vendor allowances for attaining certain purchase levels these vendor allowances are accrued as earned over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases amounts accrued throughout the program year could require adjustment if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met we believe that our estimate of vendor allowances earned based on expected volume of purchases over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowances to be received from our vendors since most volumebased programs apply to a calendar year or our fiscal year the amount of judgment required as of any fiscal year end is minimal 

longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the sum of the estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash flows we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis for a depreciable longlived asset the new cost basis is depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset 

when reviewing longlived assets for impairment we group longlived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for longlived assets deployed at store locations we review for impairment at the individual store level these reviews involve comparing the carrying value of all land buildings leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment located at each store to the net cash flow projections for each store in addition we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate for example a shared asset such as a distribution center would be evaluated by reference to the aggregate assets liabilities and projected cash flows of all areas of the businesses utilizing those shared assets 

our impairment loss calculations involve uncertainty because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including estimating useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses 

goodwill 

goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on discounted cash flows or relative marketbased approaches if the fair value exceeds carrying value then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value 

the carrying value of goodwill at january 31 2015 was 425 million which related entirely to our us reporting unit in fiscal 2015 we determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value was substantial we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

tax contingencies 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any time many tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we may record a liability for such exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate and would be recognized in the period of resolution 

revenue recognition 

the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the effects of future events 

returns – we recognize revenue net of estimated returns at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise or receives services we estimate the liability for sales returns with a corresponding reduction to revenue and cost of sales based on historical return data we believe that our estimate for sales returns is a reasonable reflection of future returns however if our estimates are significantly below or above the actual return amounts our reported revenue and cost of sales could be impacted 

gift cards – we sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores through our websites and through selected third parties a liability is initially established for the value of the gift card we recognize revenue from gift cards when i the card is redeemed by the customer or ii the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote “gift card breakage” we determine our gift card breakage rate based on historical redemption patterns which show that after 24 months we can determine the portion of the liability for which redemption is remote our estimate of the amount and timing of redemptions of gift cards is based primarily on historical data 

customer loyalty programs   –  we have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed or when using our cobranded credit cards points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases the value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed our estimate of the amount and timing of redemptions of certificates is based primarily on historical data 

service contracts –  we also sell service contracts for technical support maintenance and other programs revenue on service contracts is deferred at the time of purchase and recognized either i ratably over the term of the contract or ii under a utilization model based on the consumption of services during the contract term compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract our estimate of the services consumed under service contracts is based on historical data 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions of our revenue recognition critical accounting estimates however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

the following table presents the effect on net earnings from a 10 change in each of the estimates described above as of january 31 2015  in millions 



costs associated with vacant leased property 

from timetotime we vacate leased stores and other leased properties prior to the expiration of the related lease for vacated locations with remaining lease commitments we record a reserve for the difference between the present value of our future lease payments and related costs eg real estate taxes and common area maintenance less expected future sublease rental income from the date we cease to use of the property through the end of the lease term 

our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience our analysis of the specific real estate market including input from independent real estate firms and economic conditions cash flows are discounted using a riskfree interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term 

the liability recorded for vacant locations involves uncertainty because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods the amount and timing of future settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vacant location liability however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our vacant space reserve at january 31 2015 would have affected net earnings by approximately 4 million in fiscal 2015 

stockbased compensation 

we have a stockbased compensation plan which includes nonqualified stock options and nonvested share awards we determine the fair value of our nonqualified stock option awards using optionpricing models we determine the fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions using montecarlo simulation we determine the fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or time conditions at the closing market price of our stock reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period where the recipient has no dividend rights compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest managements key assumptions are developed with input from independent thirdparty valuation advisors 

valuation techniques used require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price expected dividend yield future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors and correlations between our returns and peer company returns changes in these assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate 

estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment of the amounts that will be forfeited due to failure to fulfill service conditions to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised changes in estimates can materially affect compensation expense within individual periods 

estimates and assumptions are based upon information currently available including historical experience and current business and economic conditions however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in stockbased compensation expense that could be material a 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense for the year ended january 31 2015 would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 million in fiscal 2015 

selfinsured liabilities 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to health workers compensation and general liability claims as well as customer warranty programs although we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain of these claims when estimating our selfinsured liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and valuations provided by independent thirdparty actuaries our selfinsured liabilities involve uncertainty because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our selfinsured liabilities however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our selfinsured liabilities at january 31 2015 would have affected net earnings by approximately 7 million in fiscal 2015 

new accounting pronouncements   

in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of components of an entity  the new guidance amends the definition of a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation the new guidance is effective prospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 we do not expect adoption of the new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers  as a new topic accounting standards codification asc topic 606 the new guidance provides a comprehensive framework for the analysis of revenue transactions and will apply to all of our revenue streams based on the current effective dates the new guidance would first apply in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 while we are still in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption on our financial statements we do not currently expect a material impact on our results of operations cash flows or financial position 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international segment operations on a limited basis we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecast inventory purchases recognized receivable and payable balances and our investment in our canadian operations our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows as well as of the net asset value associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency risk management strategy includes both hedging instruments and derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments which generally have terms of up to 12 months the aggregate notional amount related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  was 409 million  and 157 million  respectively the fair value recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at january 31 2015  and february 1 2014  30 million  and 3 million  respectively the amount recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings related to all contracts settled and outstanding was a gain of 12 million  in fiscal 2015  and a gain of 5 million  in fiscal 2014  

the strength of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar and mexican peso since the end of fiscal 2014 had a negative overall impact on our revenue as these currencies translated into fewer us dollars we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue in fiscal 2015  of approximately 308 million and a net unfavorable impact on earnings of 4 million  in fiscal 2014 the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately 203 million and an unfavorable impact on earnings of 6 million

suppliers and inventory

we carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible key elements to our inventory management process include the following continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products

international segment 

in our international segment we opened 13 new stores and closed 27 stores in fiscal 2014 store openings were primarily driven by best buy mobile stores in canada and best buy stores in mexico store closures were primarily driven by five star stores in china in fiscal 2015 we expect to continue to review our portfolio of stores across all geographies 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for tables reconciling our domestic and international segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years 

intellectual property 

we own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks service marks and tradenames including but not limited to best buy best buy mobile dynex five star future shop geek squad init insignia magnolia pacific sales rocketfish  and our yellow tag  logo 

we have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands we have also secured patents for many of our inventions we believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company our stores our products and our websites 

seasonality 

our business like that of many retailers is seasonal a higher proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico 

working capital 

we fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash flows generated from operations in addition our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs for general corporate purposes and investment opportunities our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales 

competition 

our competitors are primarily traditional storebased retailers multichannel retailers internetbased businesses and vendors who offer their products directly to the consumer 

some of our competitors have low cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price in addition in the us onlineonly operators are exempt from collecting sales taxes in certain states we believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are reevaluated at both the state and federal levels we carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and investing in price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities in addition we have a pricematching policy in the us that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators in order to allow this we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships 

in addition to price we believe our ability to deliver a high quality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage we believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people integrated online and store channels broad product assortment range of focused service and support offerings distinct store formats brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage 

environmental matters 

we are working to transform our company in many ways including lessening our environmental impact in the us consumers recycle more electronics through best buy than any other retailer we set a goal to collect one billion pounds of consumer electronics and appliances for recycling from june 2008 through december 2014 in fiscal 2014 we collected about 118 million pounds of consumer electronics and 112 million pounds of appliances bringing our overall total to approximately 930 million pounds 

we offer a large selection of energyefficient products to help customers save money by using less energy our us best buy customers purchased more than 20 million energy star® certified products in fiscal 2014 and realized utility bill savings of more than 76 million this energy saving equates to over 1 billion pounds of co 2  avoidance or the equivalent of removing more than 98000 cars from us roads 

we are continuously working to make our stores and distribution centers more sustainable and to increase efficiency within our supply chain in calendar 2010 we set a goal of reducing our absolute carbon emissions in north america by 20 by the year 2020 over a 2009 baseline during fiscal 2014 our retail stores distribution centers and corporate offices reduced more than 15000 metric tons of co 2 emissions through energy efficiency measures 

we are not aware of any federal state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment that have materially affected or are reasonably expected to materially affect our net earnings or competitive position or have resulted or are reasonably expected to result in material capital expenditures see item 1a risk factors  for additional discussion 

number of employees 

at the end of fiscal 2014 we employed approximately 140000  fulltime parttime and seasonal employees worldwide we consider our employee relations to be good we offer our employees a wide array of companypaid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements which we believe are competitive in the aggregate relative to others in our industry

 item 1a risk factors 

described below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industry in which we operate you should carefully consider each of the following risk factors in conjunction with other information provided in this annual report on form 10k and in our other public disclosures the risks described below highlight potential events trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or access to sources of financing and consequently the market value of our common stock and debt instruments these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance the risks described below are not an exhaustive list of all the risks we face there may be others that we have not identified or that we have deemed to be immaterial all forwardlooking statements made by us or on our behalf are qualified by the risks described below 

we face strong competition from traditional storebased retailers multichannel retailers internetbased businesses our vendors and other forms of retail commerce which directly affects our sales and margins 

the retail business is highly competitive price is of primary importance to customers and price transparency and comparability continues to increase particularly as a result of digital tools we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers as well as certain of our vendors who offer their products directly to consumers some of our competitors have greater market presence and financial resources than we do the retail industry continues to experience a trend toward an increase in internet sales and some internetonly businesses are not required to collect and remit sales taxes in all us states which can negatively impact the ability of storebased retailers to be price competitive in addition because our business strategy is based on offering superior levels of customer service utilizing a multichannel platform our cost structure is higher than some of our competitors changes in the levels of these various competitive factors may have a significant impact on consumer demand for our products and services and the margins we can generate from them 

failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner could result in a decline in our sales 

our success depends on our vendors and our ability to successfully introduce new products services and technologies to consumers the level of success we achieve is dependent on among other factors the frequency of product and service innovations how accurately we predict consumer preferences the level of consumer demand the availability of merchandise the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment consumers continue to have a wide variety of choices in terms of how and where they purchase the products and services we sell failure to accurately predict and adapt to constantly changing technology and consumer preferences spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

sustained or worsening economic pressures in the us and key international markets could adversely affect consumer spending and our financial results 

for the past several years we have experienced the impact of difficult and uncertain macroeconomic conditions in the geographic markets in which we operate some of our products and services are viewed by some consumers to be discretionary items rather than necessities as a result our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending consumer confidence employment levels interest rates tax rates availability of consumer financing housing market conditions and costs for items such as fuel energy and food can adversely affect consumers demand for the products and services that we offer our future results could be significantly adversely impacted by these factors 

if we fail to attract develop and retain qualified employees including employees in key positions our business and operating results may be harmed 

our performance is highly dependent on attracting and retaining qualified employees including our senior management team and other key employees our strategy of offering high quality services and assistance for our customers requires a highly trained and engaged workforce the turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store employees factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale our reputation unemployment rates competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate compensation packages our inability to recruit a sufficient number of qualified individuals or failure to retain key employees in the future may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities in addition we have experienced a significant amount of turnover of senior management employees with specific knowledge relating to us our operations and our industry which turnover may negatively impact our operations 

consumer demand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition 

we operate a global portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation we believe that recognition and the reputation of our brands are key to our success the proliferation of webbased social media means that consumer feedback and other information about our company are shared with a broad audience in a manner that is easily accessible and rapidly disseminated damage to the perception or reputation of our brands could result in declines in customer loyalty lower employee retention and productivity vendor relationship issues and other factors all of which could materially affect our profitability 

our success is dependent on the design and execution of appropriate business strategies   

our success is dependent on our ability to identify develop and execute appropriate strategies our current strategy includes transformational change to many areas of our business including our online and instore customer experience expanding our distribution system by shipping to customers from our stores employee training and engagement partnership with our vendors retail execution and cost control achieving the goals we have set in a timely manner will be challenging and it is possible that our strategies may prove to be ineffective and that we may need to make substantial changes to them in future periods it is also possible that we will be unsuccessful in executing our strategies that the strategies we will implement expose us to additional risks or that strategies that have been successful in the past will fail to produce the desired results our results could be materially adversely affected if we fail to design and execute appropriate strategies the market value of our common stock and debt instruments could be materially adversely affected if investors are uncertain about the appropriateness of our strategies or our ability to execute them 

refer to item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further information regarding our strategies 

failure to effectively manage our property portfolio may negatively impact our operating results 

as a multinational retailer effective management of our large property portfolio is critical to our success we primarily secure properties through operating leases with thirdparty landlords if we fail to negotiate appropriate terms for new leases we enter into we may incur lease costs that are excessive and cause operating margins to be below acceptable levels we may also make term commitments that are too long or too short without the option to extend the availability of suitable new property locations may also hinder our ability to maintain or grow our operations factors such as the condition of local property markets availability of lease financing taxes zoning and environmental issues and competitive actions may impact the availability for suitable property 

we have closed stores and we may close additional stores or other facilities in the future for leased property the financial impact of exiting a property can vary greatly depending on among other factors the terms of the lease the condition of the local property market demand for the specific property our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sublease tenants it is difficult for us to influence some of these factors if these factors are unfavorable to us then the costs of exiting a property can be significant when we enter into a contract with a tenant to sublease property we remain at risk of default by the tenant and the impact of such defaults on our future results could be significant 

failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

certain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature consumer spending remains uncertain which makes it more challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income the competitiveness in our industry and increasing price transparency mean that the focus on achieving efficient operations is greater than ever as a result we must continuously focus on managing our cost structure failure to manage our labor and benefit rates advertising and marketing expenses operating leases other store expenses or indirect spending could severely impair our ability to maintain our price competitiveness while achieving acceptable levels of profitability 

our liquidity may be materially adversely affected by constraints in the capital markets or our vendor credit terms 

we need sufficient sources of liquidity to fund our working capital requirements service our outstanding indebtedness and finance investment opportunities without sufficient liquidity we could be forced to curtail our operations or we may not be able to pursue business opportunities the principal sources of our liquidity are funds generated from operating activities available cash and liquid investments credit facilities other debt arrangements and trade payables our liquidity could be materially adversely impacted if our vendors reduce payment terms andor impose tighter credit limits if our sources of liquidity do not satisfy our requirements we may need to seek additional financing the future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions the regulatory environment for banks and other financial institutions the availability of credit and our credit ratings and our reputation with potential lenders these factors could materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing and our ability to pursue growth opportunities and threaten our ability to meet our obligations as they become due 

changes in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital and materially increase our borrowing costs 

in fiscal 2014 moodys investors service inc maintained its longterm credit rating at baa2 but revised its outlook from developing to negative fitch ratings ltd and standard  poors ratings services maintained their longterm credit ratings at bb and bb respectively and each revised its outlook from negative to stable 

future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact our access to capital markets the borrowing cost for future financings and the perception of our credit risk by lenders and other third parties our credit ratings are based upon information furnished by us or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time rating agencies may change the ratings assigned to us due to developments that are beyond our control including the introduction of new rating practices and methodologies 

any downgrade may result in higher interest costs for certain of our credit facilities and could result in higher interest costs on future financings in addition downgrades may impact our ability to obtain adequate financing including via trade payables with our vendors customers inclination to shop with us or purchase gift cards or extended warranties may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of our credit ratings 

failure to effectively manage strategic ventures or acquisitions could have a negative impact on our business 

from time to time our strategy has involved and may in the future involve entering into new business ventures and strategic alliances and making acquisitions assessing a potential opportunity can be based on assumptions that might not ultimately prove to be correct in addition the amount of information we can obtain about a potential opportunity may be limited and we can give no assurance that new business ventures strategic alliances and acquisitions will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned the success of these opportunities is also largely dependent on the current and future participation working relationship and strategic vision of the business venture or strategic alliance partners which can change following a transaction integrating new businesses stores and concepts can be a difficult task cultural differences in some markets into which we may expand or into which we may introduce new retail concepts may not be as well received by customers as originally anticipated these types of transactions may divert our capital and our managements attention from other business issues and opportunities and may also negatively impact our return on invested capital further implementing strategic alliances or business ventures may also impair our relationships with our vendors or other strategic partners we may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire including their personnel financial systems distribution operations and general operating procedures we may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting and deficiencies in information technology systems in connection with the integration of an acquired company if we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully our business reputation and operating results could suffer materially likewise our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to impairment of the associated goodwill and intangible asset balances 

failure to protect the integrity security and confidentiality of our customers data including payment card information could expose us to litigation costs and materially damage our standing with our customers 

the use and handling of personally identifiable data by our business our business associates and third parties is regulated at the state federal and international levels we are also contractually obligated to comply with certain industry standards regarding payment card information increasing costs associated with information security such as increased investment in technology the costs of compliance and costs resulting from consumer fraud could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially additionally the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of customer and other confidential information over public networks including the use of cashless payments while we take significant steps to protect this information lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees business associates or third parties may undermine our security measures as a result unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate customer and other confidential data there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will prevent the compromise of our customer transaction processing capabilities and customer personal data furthermore because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures any such compromise of our security or the security of information residing with our business associates or third parties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and may expose us to material costs penalties and compensation claims in addition any compromise of our data security may materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such breaches and could subject us to additional legal risk 

our reliance on key vendors subjects us to various risks and uncertainties which could affect our operating results 

we source the products we sell from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors in fiscal 2014 our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 70 of the merchandise we purchased with 5 suppliers – apple samsung hewlettpackard sony and lg electronics – representing approximately 45 of total merchandise purchased we generally do not have longterm written contracts with our major suppliers that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise if there is a loss of or disruption in supply from any of our key vendors if any of our key vendors fail to develop new technologies that consumers demand or if our vendors make changes that affect the timing of when customers are able to make purchases our revenues and earnings may be materially adversely affected in addition the formation or strengthening of business partnerships between our vendors and our competitors could limit our access to merchandise 

we have internal standards that we require all of our vendors to meet our ability to find qualified vendors who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the us political or financial instability merchandise quality issues product safety concerns trade restrictions work stoppages tariffs foreign currency exchange rates transportation capacity and costs inflation civil unrest natural disasters outbreaks of pandemics and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control these and other issues affecting our vendors could materially adversely affect our financial results 

natural disasters changes in climate and geopolitical events could adversely affect our operating results 

the threat or occurrence of one or more natural disasters or other extreme weather events whether as a result of climate change or otherwise the threat or outbreak of terrorism civil unrest or other hostilities or conflicts could materially adversely affect our financial performance these events may result in damage to or destruction or closure of our stores distribution centers and other properties such events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and other properties can modify consumer purchasing patterns and decrease disposable income and can disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain and distribution network 

our exclusive brands products are subject to several additional product supply chain and legal risks that could affect our operating results 

sales of our exclusive brands products which primarily include insignia dynex init platinum and rocketfish branded products represent an important component of our revenue most of these products are manufactured by contracted manufacturers based in southeastern asia this arrangement exposes us to the following additional potential risks which could materially adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results 

 

maintaining consistent quality availability and competitive pricing of our exclusive brands products helps us build and maintain customer loyalty generate sales and achieve acceptable margins failure to maintain these factors could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for exclusive brand products and the margins we are able to generate from them 

we are subject to certain statutory regulatory and legal developments which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our statutory regulatory and legal environments expose us to complex compliance and litigation risks that could materially adversely affect our operations and financial results the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face are 

 

defending against lawsuits and other proceedings may involve significant expense and divert managements attention and resources from other matters 

changes to the national labor relations act or other laborrelated statutes or regulations could have an adverse impact on our costs and impair the viability of our operating model 

the national labor relations board “nlrb” continually considers changes to labor regulations many of which could significantly impact the nature of labor relations in the us and how union organizing and union elections are conducted the nlrb has stated it intends to attempt to make union organizing easier the us department of labor is considering new regulations requiring companies to publicly report the use and associated expense of external resources providing labor relations guidance and advice as of february 1 2014 none of our us operations had employees represented by labor unions or working under collective bargaining agreements changes in laborrelated statutes or regulations could increase the percentage of elections won by unions if any segment of best buy’s operations became unionized it could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our operations 

additional legislation or regulatory activity could have a material adverse impact on our costs or disrupt our operations 

  

environmental legislation or other regulatory changes could impose unexpected costs or impact us more directly than other companies due to our operations as a global retailer specifically environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy carbon emissions electronics recycling and water or product materials are continually being explored by governing bodies increasing energy and fuel costs supply chain disruptions and other potential risks to our business as well as any significant rulemaking or passage of any such legislation could materially increase the cost to transport our goods and materially adversely affect our results of operations new regulations governing consumer privacy and security whether imposed as a result of increased cyber security risks or otherwise could materially increase our compliance costs regulatory activity focused on the retail industry has increased in recent years increasing the risk of fines and additional operational costs associated with compliance 

  

economic regulatory and other developments could adversely affect the profitability of our credit card arrangements and our promotional financing offerings and therefore our operating results 

  

we offer promotional financing through credit cards issued by a thirdparty bank that manages and directly extends credit to our customers the cardholders can receive low or nointerest promotional financing on qualifying purchases promotional financing credit card sales account for approximately 19 of our revenue in fiscal 2014 we view these arrangements as a way to generate incremental sales of products and services from customers who prefer the financing terms to other available forms of payment and incremental income from the payments received from our banking partners the profitability of our new credit card arrangement is more dependent on the performance of our credit card portfolio than our previous arrangement regulatory legislative or economic factors could adversely affect the performance of the portfolio and this may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

  

in addition continuing changes in the economic and regulatory environment in the banking industry may lead banks to reevaluate their strategies practices and terms including but not limited to the extent to which consumer credit is granted and the strategic focus on the retail partner credit card business promotional financing volumes could be materially adversely affected in response to substantial changes to our credit card program such as substantial modifications to the terms and provisions of the program or substantial adjustments to approval rates or the types of financing offered to our customers 

our international activities subject us to risks associated with the legislative judicial regulatory political accounting and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate 

  

we have a presence in various foreign countries including bermuda canada china germany hong kong japan luxembourg mexico the republic of mauritius the netherlands taiwan turks and caicos and the uk during fiscal 2014 our international segments operations generated 16 of our revenue our future operating results in these countries and in other countries or regions throughout the world where we may operate in the future could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control including political conditions economic conditions legal and regulatory constraints foreign trade rules and monetary and fiscal policies both of the us and of other countries in addition foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future revenues earnings and cash flows from international operations and could materially adversely affect our reported financial performance 

  

our international segments operations face other risks as well including the costs and difficulties of managing international operations greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the us and potential adverse tax consequences the various risks inherent in doing business in the us generally also exist when doing business outside of the us and may be exaggerated by the complexity of operating in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture laws and regulations there is a heightened risk that we misjudge the response of consumers in foreign markets to our product and service assortments marketing and promotional strategy and store and website designs among other factors and this could adversely impact the results of these operations and the viability of these ventures 

  

we rely heavily on our management information systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business 

  

the effective and efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems we rely heavily on our management information systems to manage all key aspects of our business including demand forecasting purchasing supply chain management pointofsale processing staff planning and deployment website offerings financial management and forecasting and safeguarding critical and sensitive information the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate or to meet the continuously evolving needs of our business could significantly disrupt our business and cause for example higher costs and lost revenues and could threaten our ability to remain in operation 

  

we rely on thirdparty vendors for certain aspects of our business operations 

  

we engage key thirdparty business partners to manage various functions of our business including but not limited to information technology human resource operations customer loyalty programs promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards customer warranty and insurance programs any material disruption in our relationship with key thirdparty business partners or any disruption in the services or systems provided or managed by third parties could impact our revenues and cost structure and hinder our ability to continue operations particularly if a disruption occurs during peak revenue periods 

  

we are highly dependent on the cash flows and net earnings we generate during our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season 

  

approximately onethird of our revenue and more than onehalf of our net earnings have historically been generated in our fourth fiscal quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico unexpected events or developments such as natural or manmade disasters product sourcing issues failure or interruption of management information systems disruptions in services or systems provided or managed by thirdparty vendors or adverse economic conditions in our fourth fiscal quarter could have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations 

our revenues and margins are highly sensitive to developments in products and services 

  

the consumer electronics industry involves constant innovation and evolution of products and services offered to consumers the following examples demonstrate the impact this can have on our business 

  

 

many of the factors described above are not controllable by us the factors can have a material adverse impact on our relevance to the consumer and the demand for products and services we have traditionally offered it is possible that these and similar changes could materially affect our revenues and profitability 

failure to meet the financial performance guidance or other forwardlooking statements we have provided to the public could result in a decline in our stock price 

  

we may provide public guidance on our expected financial results for future periods although we believe that this guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of managements expectations for the future and is useful to our stockholders and potential stockholders such guidance is comprised of forwardlooking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements our actual results may not always be in line with or exceed the guidance we have provided if our financial results for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods the market price of our common stock may decline

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of our management on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect our future results unless otherwise noted transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude our mda is presented in six sections 

 

our mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we are a multinational multichannel retailer of technology products including tablets and computers televisions mobile phones large and small appliances entertainment products digital imaging and related accessories we also offer consumers technology services – including technical support repair troubleshooting and installation – under the geek squad brand we operate two reportable segments domestic and international the domestic segment is comprised of all operations within the us and its territories the international segment is comprised of all operations outside the us and its territories 

our business like that of many retailers is seasonal historically we have realized more of our revenue and earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the us canada and mexico while consumers view some of the products and services we offer as essential others are viewed as discretionary purchases consequently our financial results are susceptible to changes in consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors including unemployment consumer credit availability and the condition of the housing market additionally there are other factors that directly impact our performance such as product lifecycles including the introduction and pace of adoption of new technology and the competitive retail environment as a result of these factors predicting our future revenue and net earnings is difficult however we remain confident in our unique customer promise 1 the latest devices and services all in one place 2 impartial and knowledgeable advice 3 competitive prices 4 the ability to shop when and where you want and 5 support for the life of your products 

throughout this mda we refer to comparable store sales comparable store sales is a commonly used metric in the retail industry which compares revenue for a particular period with the corresponding period in the prior year excluding the impact of sales from new stores opened or closed stores our comparable store sales is comprised of revenue from stores operating for at least 14 full months as well as revenue related to website and online sales call centers and our other comparable sales channels revenue we earn from sales of merchandise to wholesalers or dealers is generally not included within our comparable store sales calculation relocated stores as well as remodeled expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening acquired stores are included in the comparable store sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition the calculation of comparable store sales excludes the impact of the extra week of revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 as well as revenue from discontinued operations the portion of our calculation of the comparable store sales percentage change attributable to our international segment excludes the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry as a result our method of calculating comparable store sales may not be the same as other retailers methods 

in our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our international segment we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the international segment’s operating results from local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is typically calculated as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period’s currency exchange rates and the comparable prioryear period’s currency exchange rates we use this method to calculate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for all countries where the functional currency is not the us dollar 

in our discussions of the operating results below we sometimes refer to the impact of net new stores on our results of operations the key factors that dictate the impact that the net new stores have on our operating results include i store opening and closing decisions ii the size and format of new stores as we operate stores ranging from approximately 1000 square feet to approximately 50000 square feet iii the length of time the stores were open during the period and iv the overall success of new store launches 

this mda includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap as well as certain nongaap financial measures such as adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings from continuing operations adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and adjusted debt to earnings before goodwill impairment interest income taxes depreciation amortization and rent ebitdar ratio generally a nongaap financial measure is a numerical measure of financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap the nongaap financial measures should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with gaap nongaap measures as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

we believe that the nongaap measures described above provide meaningful supplemental information to assist shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance management believes adjusted operating income adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses management makes standard adjustments for items such as restructuring charges goodwill impairments nonrestructuring asset impairments and gains or losses on sales of investments as well as adjustments for other items that may arise during the period and have a meaningful impact on comparability to measure adjusted operating income we removed the impact of restructuring charges nonrestructuring asset impairments goodwill impairments and the impact of second quarter fiscal 2014 lcdrelated legal settlements from our calculation of operating income adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was calculated by 

removing the aftertax impact of operating income adjustments and the gain on sale of investments as well as the tax impact of the best buy europe sale from our calculation of net earnings from continuing operations to measure adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations we excluded the per share impact of net earnings adjustments from our calculation of diluted earnings per share management believes our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is an important indicator of our creditworthiness because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies nongaap financial measures having the same or similar names these nongaap financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to corresponding gaap financial measures within our discussion of consolidated performance below provide a more complete understanding of our business we strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

business strategy 

in the fall of 2012 we laid out for investors the state of our business and summarized the challenges we faced by articulating two fundamental problems 1 declining comparable store sales and 2 shrinking margins to address these problems and achieve our goal of becoming the leading authority and destination for technology products and services we revealed our renew blue transformation effort that effort has five pillars and they are 

 

this past year was the first full fiscal year in our renew blue transformation while we remain in the early stages of our journey we are pleased to report significant progress most notably we stabilized our revenue and achieved virtually flat domestic segment comparable store sales we increased our domestic online revenue by nearly 20 percent we increased our net promoter score by 300 basis points and in one year we exceeded our multiyear renew blue cost reduction target of 725 million 

beyond these successes we made additional operational improvements that included increased price competitiveness a shipfromstore ability now in place in more than 1400 locations the opening of 1400 samsung and 600 windows storeswithinastore and the completion of the first phase of our floor space optimization the relaunch of our loyalty and credit card programs and the strengthening of our balance sheet through a renewed focus on our core business and a substantially more disciplined capital allocation process 

renew blue road map for the next 24 months 

looking ahead we remain focused on stabilizing and improving our comparable store sales and increasing profitability to aid in this focus we have created a road map for the next 24 months of our transformation this road map is grounded in our belief that we need to do three things over the upcoming fiscal year and next we must improve operational performance build foundational capabilities necessary to unlock future growth and make full use of our unique assets to create significant differentiation for our customers and vendors with this mind our road map is built around eight priorities 

merchandising  our goal is to create a compelling assortment online and in the stores with a superior endtoend customer experience that yields enhanced financial returns our priorities in merchandising over the next 24 months include the following 1 developing compelling and differentiated strategies for key categories that leverage our competitive assets 2 strengthening vendor partnerships 3 implementing an enhanced online shopping experience for key categories 4 expanding pacific kitchen and home and magnolia design centers storeswithinastore and 5 optimizing returns replacement and damages through operational improvements like shipfromstore 

marketing  our goal is to unlock growth opportunities by creating and effectively communicating new compelling value propositions for customers that go beyond price our priorities in marketing over the next 24 months include developing more targeted relevant and personalized customer communications in support of category strategies as well as creating greater engagement with customers through our loyalty program and our credit card offering 

online  our goal is to continue to capture online market share and serve customers based on how where and when they want to be served our online priorities over the next 24 months include further improving the online shopping experience to make it easier for customers to find and choose products encouraging customers to complete their technology solutions by improving 

the presentation of accessories and services and enabling customers to build their own bundle as well as leveraging our expanded supply chain capabilities we will also continue to reengineer our ecommerce technology platform so that new features and functions can be developed quickly and optimized across platforms 

retail stores  our ability to transform best buy is highly dependent on our ability to transform our instore experience to that end we are evolving our field organization based on what we see as the mission of retail which is 1 the execution of category and functional strategies 2 the development and implementation of effective marketlevel strategies that take into account the specifics of local markets and 3 the ability to lift our performance in terms of employee engagement customer satisfaction sales and profitability 

supply chain  we believe that our supply chain is a competitive advantage driven by a powerful network of strategically located distribution centers and the recently launched shipfromstore capabilities our goal over the next 24 months is to use this network and improve our customer experience by providing 1 increased inventory availability 2 improved speed to the customer and 3 improved home delivery and installation capabilities for our largecube assortment to achieve this we will continue to invest in systems and infrastructure to drive significantly enhanced delivery options 

geek squad services  we believe the geek squad is one of our biggest competitive advantages yet at the same time we believe it is an underutilized asset our goal for the geek squad is to deliver a superior customer experience while providing a key revenue and profit growth engine for best buy our goals for geek squad over the next 24 months include 1 improving our service delivery and the service experience for our customers 2 refining existing service offerings eg extended warranty services and 3 building new offerings that meet the needs of customers in the context of today’s technology environment 

cost structure  our goal is to more quickly and deeply reduce our costs through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we eliminated a total of 765 million in annualized costs which exceeded our original multiyear target of 725 million we have now increased our target to 1 billion we expect these additional cost reductions to come primarily from 1 returns replacements and damages 2 logistics and supply chain 3 procurement and 4 continued rationalization of our organization 

employee engagement  across the company we have a commitment to serving our customers in such an extraordinary manner that they become promoters of best buy a key to achieving this goal is the talent and engagement of our people in line with this over the next 24 months we will be pursuing the successful implementation of our new field and storeoperating model the strengthening of our talent in critical areas and the redefining of key business processes to better support our multichannel customerfocused strategy 

in addition to the areas above we plan to focus on improving the performance in our international segment largely as a result of our renew blue initiatives we reduced international sga in fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2015 we expect to take further actions to reduce our international segment’s cost structure 

longterm financial targets 

all of these initiatives are in pursuit of our longterm nongaap targets of a 5 to 6 operating income rate and a 13 to 15 return on invested capital 

fiscal 2015 trends 

in the us we have an agreement with citibank for the issuance of promotional financing and customer loyalty credit cards bearing the best buy brand the citibank credit card agreement we commenced operating under the citibank credit card agreement in september 2013 at which point citibank acquired the customer portfolio from the previous bank the citibank credit card agreement is expected to result in lower revenue and gross profit rates due to less favorable economics as a result of changes in both the regulatory and overall consumer credit market revenues we earn under the citibank credit card agreement are primarily based on the profitability of the credit card portfolio these revenues are inherently more difficult to forecast than revenues earned under the previous credit card agreement which were primarily based on new account activations 

in fiscal 2015 we estimate we will generate 150 million to 200 million less revenue from our credit card agreement than in fiscal 2014 a portion of this yearoveryear decrease is driven by the accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue related to our previous credit card agreement in fiscal 2014 

in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 we expect the following business drivers to have a net negative impact on our operating income rate 1 ongoing price investments 2 incremental renew blue sga investments 3 the increase in our product warrantyrelated costs due to higher mobile phone claims frequency 4 the negative impact of our credit card agreement with citibank as described above and 5 the offsetting positive impact of the realization of renew blue cost savings we expect the net negative impact of these factors to be greatest in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 as we expect to realize greater cost savings in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015 

  

in addition we anticipate reorganizing certain european legal entities to simplify our overall structure in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we currently expect this reorganization to accelerate a noncash tax benefit of approximately 310 million to 365 million as a result of this acceleration we are expecting a lower annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 

results of operations

during fiscal 2014 12month we made substantial progress against our renew blue priorities first we exceeded our original renew blue annualized cost reduction targets second we made progress stabilizing our comparable store sales and operating income rate in our domestic segment comparable stores sales were nearly flat for fiscal 2014 12month domestic operating income increased in fiscal 2014 12month however this was driven by lcdrelated legal settlements and lower restructuring charges excluding these items our operating income rate decreased primarily due to a lower gross profit rate which was only partially offset by cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management 

the components of the 79 revenue increase in the domestic segment in fiscal 2014 12month were as follows 



 

the decrease in revenue from net store changes was primarily due to the closure of 47 largeformat best buy branded stores in the second and third quarter of fiscal 2013 11month the opening and closing of smallformat best buy mobile stores had a significantly smaller impact given their smaller size and limited category focus compared to our largeformat stores

the following is a description of the notable comparable store sales changes in our domestic segment by revenue category 

   

our domestic segment experienced an increase in gross profit of 485 million  or 62  in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month driven by the extra month of activity excluding the extra month gross profit declined due to a decline in the gross profit rate and lower revenue the 03  of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate resulted primarily from a greater investment in price competitiveness and increased product warrantyrelated costs associated with higher claims frequency in mobile phones these items were partially offset by lcdrelated legal settlements the realization of renew blue cost reductions and other supply chain cost containment initiatives and the accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with our prior credit card agreement 

  

our domestic segments sga increased 278 million  or 41  in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month excluding the extra month of activity sga decreased primarily from the realization of our renew blue cost reduction initiatives tighter expense management throughout the company and to a lesser extent the impact of store closures in fiscal 2013 11month these decreases were partially offset by renew blue investments including optimization of our retail floor space and the replatforming of and functionality enhancements to bestbuycom these factors also contributed to the 07  of revenue decline in the sga rate 

  

our domestic segment recorded 123 million  of restructuring charges in fiscal 2014 12month primarily related to employee termination benefits as a result of renew blue cost reduction initiatives these restructuring charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2014 12month of 03 of revenue in fiscal 2013 11month our domestic segment recorded restructuring charges of 328 million which included 1 million of inventory writedowns included in cost of goods sold the restructuring charges related to our renew blue and first quarter fiscal 2013 us restructuring activities and consisted primarily of facility closure costs employee termination benefits and asset impairments these restructuring charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2013 11month of 10 of revenue refer to note 6 restructuring charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our restructuring activities 

  

our domestic segment’s operating income increased 414 million  or 10  or revenue in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month excluding the extra month of activity operating income increased primarily due to lower sga expenses and a decrease in restructuring partially offset by lower gross profit as described above

in the first three quarters of fiscal 2013 11month we experienced continued declines in comparable store sales and gross margins management took action to reverse these negative trends including increased training for our retail employees and a pricematch policy for online and retail store competitors during the us holiday season during the fourth quarter we achieved comparable store sales growth and stable gross margins 

in fiscal 2013 11month we experienced sales growth in mobile phones and tablets due to continued demand for these products as new technology is introduced we also experienced sales growth in appliances primarily from the introduction of additional pacific kitchen and home storewithinastore locations however these increases were more than offset by decreases in other product categories such as gaming computers digital imaging and televisions certain of these products in particular compact cameras and camcorders and gaming have faced declining demand due in part to the inclusion of their key features in new products such as smartphones and tablets in addition the net impact from the closure of 47 largeformat stores in fiscal 2013 11month contributed to the overall revenue decline 

  

the components of the 26 revenue decrease in the domestic segment in fiscal 2013 11month were as follows 



the impact of net store changes on our revenue is a result of store opening and closing activity during the past 11 months as well as stores opened in the prior year that are not included in comparable store sales due to the timing of their opening the decrease in largeformat best buy branded stores contributed to the majority of the total decrease in revenue associated with net store changes in fiscal 2013 11month compared to the comparable prioryear period the addition of smallformat best buy mobile standalone stores partially offset the decrease as the proportion contributed to revenue is smaller due to their smaller square footage and limited category focus compared to our largeformat stores

our domestic segments sga grew 174 million or 27 in fiscal 2013 11month compared to fiscal 2012 11month recast the increase in sga was driven by an increase in field incentive compensation and executive retention and transition costs costs related to the addition of 104 net new best buy mobile standalone stores and increased investments in advertising and other costs to drive online sales this increase was partially offset by lower expenses as a result of largeformat store closures the sga rate increased by 11 of revenue as a result of the deleveraging impact of the revenue decline as well as from the aforementioned factors 

our domestic segment recorded 328 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2013 11month which included 1 million of inventory writedowns included in cost of goods sold the restructuring charges related to our renew blue and first quarter fiscal 2013 us restructuring activities and consisted primarily of facility closure costs employee termination benefits and asset impairments these restructuring charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2013 11month of 10 of revenue our domestic segment recorded restructuring charges of 38 million including 19 million of inventory writedowns included in cost of goods sold in fiscal 2012 11month recast the restructuring charges consisted of facility closure costs and property and equipment impairments related to our fiscal 2012 restructuring activities as well as inventory writedowns and facility closure costs related primarily to our fiscal 2011 restructuring activities refer to note 6 restructuring charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our restructuring activities

in fiscal 2014 12month we experienced differing comparable store sales in the various geographies in our international segment in canada we experienced a comparable store sales decline as sales were negatively impacted by lower industry demand for consumer electronics in china we experienced a comparable store sales gain primarily due to a government subsidy program that ended in may 2013 which positively impacted appliance sales partially offset by increased competition from online competitors putting pressure on prices across most product categories we also started to implement our renew blue initiatives in our international segment in fiscal 2014 12month while our international segment continues to experience revenue and gross profit challenges we have made progress in stabilizing comparable store sales and reducing sga expenses increased promotional activity and a higher mix of lowermargin products in canada contributed to a decline in our gross profit rate the sga rate decline was primarily driven by renew blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in canada and the elimination of expenses associated with previously closed stores in canada and china 

the components of the international segments 04  revenue decrease in fiscal 2014 12month were as follows 



 

the closure of largeformat stores in canada at the end of fiscal 2013 11month as well as largeformat five star store closures in china over the past 12 months contributed to the majority of the decrease in revenue associated with net store changes in our international segment in fiscal 2014 12month the addition of largeformat stores in mexico and smallformat best buy mobile standalone stores in canada partially offset these decreases 

the following table presents the international segments revenue mix percentages and comparable store sales percentage changes by revenue category in fiscal 2014 12month and 2013 11month 



 

the following is a description of the notable comparable store sales changes in our international segment by revenue category 

 

our international segment experienced a gross profit decline of 93 million  or 62  in fiscal 2014 12month driven primarily by revenue declines in canada and china and a decrease in the gross profit rate which were partially offset by an extra month of activity the 13  of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate was driven by increased promotional activity and an increased mix of lowermargin products primarily in canada 

our international segments sga decreased 68 million  or 47  in fiscal 2014 12month due to savings from previous store closures in canada and china and renew blue cost reduction initiatives partially offset by an extra month of activity the sga rate also decreased by 09 of revenue as a result of the aforementioned factors

fiscal 2013 11month results compared with fiscal 2012 11month recast 

for purposes of this section fiscal 2013 11month represents the 11month transition period ended february 2 2013 and fiscal 2012 11month recast represents the comparable 11month period ended january 28 2012 

we experienced a comparable store sales decline in our international segment in canada comparable store sales declines were the result of overall industry softness leading to declines in televisions computers and gaming which were partially offset by increased sales of mobile phones and tablets in china increased competition from online competitors pressured prices across most product categories while the end of certain government stimulus programs in december 2011 continued to have a negative impact on appliances the combination of lower sales in canada and china as well as a decrease in the gross profit rate due to greater promotional activity resulted in lower gross profit and operating income in our international segment 

the components of the international segments 84 revenue decrease in fiscal 2013 11month were as follows 



 

the addition of 20 largeformat stores throughout the international segment in fiscal 2013 11month five star best buy mexico and best buy canada contributed to the majority of the change in revenue associated with net new stores the impact of the closure of 21 largeformat stores in the international segment future shop best buy canada and five star had minimal impact on revenue as the majority of the closures occurred late in the fourth quarter the addition of 20 smallformat stores including 19 new smallformat best buy mobile standalone stores in canada had a significantly smaller impact on the overall revenue change given their smaller square footage compared to our largeformat stores

 38 

 

our international segment experienced a gross profit decline of 172 million or 102 in fiscal 2013 11month driven primarily by revenue declines in canada and china and a gross profit rate decline in canada the 05 of revenue decrease in the gross profit rate was due to special vendordriven promotions in fiscal 2012 11month recast that were not repeated in fiscal 2013 11month especially on televisions in canada 

our international segments sga increased 21 million or 15 in fiscal 2013 11month the increase in sga was driven by increased store asset impairments partially offset by lower spending in canada the deleveraging impact of negative comparable store sales in five star and canada contributed to the sga rate increase 

our international segment recorded 87 million and 5 million of restructuring charges in fiscal 2013 11month and 2012 11month recast respectively the restructuring charges in fiscal 2013 11month related to our renew blue restructuring activities and consisted of facility closure costs employee termination benefits and property and equipment impairments the fiscal 2012 11month recast charges related to our fiscal 2012 restructuring program and consisted of property and equipment impairments the restructuring charges resulted in a decrease in our operating income in fiscal 2013 11month of 13 of revenue refer to note 6 restructuring charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our restructuring activities 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 11month we recorded a 819 million goodwill impairment charge related to our best buy canada and five star reporting units the impairments followed significant deterioration in operating performance in the latter part of fiscal 2013 11month with results falling significantly below management forecasts as a result of this decline in performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 11month management updated longrange forecasts for the two reporting units this analysis led to the conclusion that the goodwill had no value and therefore full impairments were recorded refer to note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about the goodwill impairment 

the international segments operating loss in fiscal 2013 11month compared to operating income in fiscal 2012 11month recast was primarily due to the goodwill impairment in addition the decrease in revenue combined with the decline in the gross profit rate and the increase in restructuring charges contributed to the decrease compared to the prioryear period 

additional consolidated results 

other income expense 

in fiscal 2014 12month we recognized a gain of 20 million in connection with the exercise of a warrant and the sale of costbased investments in fiscal 2012 11month recast we sold our shares of common stock in talktalk telecom group plc and carphone warehouse group plc for 112 million and recorded a pretax gain of 55 million related to the sale 

in fiscal 2014 12month our investment income and other was 27 million compared to 20 million in fiscal 2013 11month the increase in fiscal 2014 12month was primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments balances in fiscal 2013 11month our investment income and other was 20 million compared to 23 million in fiscal 2012 11month recast the decrease in fiscal 2013 11month was primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance partially offset by a higher weighted average interest rate on cash balances 

interest expense was 100 million in fiscal 2014 12month compared to 99 million in fiscal 2013 11month the relatively flat interest expense was the result of an extra month of expense in fiscal 2014 12month offset by a decrease in interest expense as a result of replacing our previous 2013 notes that bore interest at 675 with 2018 notes that bear interest at 500 interest expense was 99 million in fiscal 2013 11month compared to 101 million in fiscal 2012 11month recast the reduction in interest expense from the repayment of our convertible debt in january 2012 was offset by an increase in interest expense on our 1 billion of longterm debt securities that remained outstanding for all 11 months in fiscal 2013 11month compared to 9 months in fiscal 2012 11month recast 

effective income tax rate 

our effective income tax rate etr was 367 in fiscal 2014 12month compared to 1358 in fiscal 2013 11month excluding the impact of the goodwill impairments which are not tax deductible the etr would have been 431 in fiscal 2013 11month the etr in fiscal 2014 12month was lower than in fiscal 2013 11month excluding the goodwill impairments as fiscal 2013 11month was higher than normal as a result of decreased tax benefits from foreign operations which were due primarily to a decrease in foreign earnings and a valuation allowance on us federal foreign tax credits 

our etr was 1358 in fiscal 2013 11month 431 excluding the impact of goodwill impairments compared to 351 in fiscal 2012 11month recast the etr in fiscal 2013 11month excluding goodwill impairments was higher than fiscal 2012 11month recast due to the previously discussed decrease in tax benefits from foreign operations 

our consolidated effective tax rate is impacted by the statutory income tax rates applicable to each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as our foreign earnings are generally taxed at lower statutory rates than the 35 us federal statutory rate changes in the proportion of our consolidated taxable earnings originating in foreign jurisdictions impact our consolidated effective rate our foreign earnings have been indefinitely reinvested outside the us and are not subject to current us income tax 

discontinued operations 

discontinued operations consists of our largeformat best buy branded stores in china and turkey and best buy europe in our international segment as well as napster and mindshift in our domestic segment 

the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2014 12month compared to a gain from discontinued operations in fiscal 2013 11month was primarily due to the impairment of our investment in best buy europe as well as the loss on the sale of mindshift in fiscal 2014 12month 

the gain from discontinued operations in fiscal 2013 11month compared to a loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2012 11month recast was primarily due to the noncash impairment charge of 12 billion to writeoff the goodwill related to our best buy europe reporting unit in fiscal 2012 11month recast and the uk largeformat stores and napster having been largely inactive during fiscal 2013 11month whereas they were still operating during fiscal 2012 11month recast in addition we recognized a benefit from positive adjustments to estimated facility closure costs associated with the closure of our best buy branded stores in the uk in fiscal 2013 11month 

net earnings loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests 

the decrease in net earnings loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month was due to a net loss in fiscal 2014 12month in best buy europe compared to net earnings in fiscal 2013 11month 

the decrease in net earnings loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal 2013 11month compared to fiscal 2012 11month recast was due to the mobile buyout in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 11month recast as a result of the mobile buyout cpw was no longer entitled to a portion of the profit share payments to best buy europe our subsidiary included in discontinued operations in which cpw previously held a 50 noncontrolling interest in addition net earnings loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interests also decreased due to a decline in net earnings of best buy europe

impact of inflation and changing prices 

highly competitive market conditions and the general economic environment minimized inflations impact on the selling prices of our products and services and on our expenses in addition price deflation and the continued commoditization of certain technology products limited our ability to increase our gross profit rate 

nongaap financial measures

adjusted operating income decreased 301 million in 2014 compared to 2013 and adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue decreased to 28 the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the extra week of operations in 2013 and a decrease in the gross profit rate adjusted to exclude lcdrelated legal settlements in the second quarter of 2014 this decrease was partially offset by lower sga spending due to the realization of renew blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management in both the domestic and international segments these same factors contributed to the yearoveryear decreases in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2014 compared to the prioryear period 

adjusted operating income decreased 692 million in 2013 compared to 2012 and adjusted operating income as a percent of revenue decreased to 34 the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue due to domestic store closures in 2013 a decrease in the gross profit rate and an increase in sga spending primarily in our domestic segment due to increases in field incentive compensation and executive retention and transition costs these factors were partially offset by the extra week of operations in 2013 these same factors contributed to the yearoveryear decreases in adjusted net earnings from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2013 compared to the prioryear period

we closely manage our liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements depend on key variables including the level of investment to support our renew blue priorities discretionary sga spending capital expenditures credit facilities and shortterm borrowing arrangements and working capital management capital expenditures are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy which to a large extent we can adjust in response to economic and other changes in our business environment we have a disciplined approach to capital allocation which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our renew blue transformation 

we ended fiscal 2014 12month with 27 billion of cash and cash equivalents compared to 18 billion at the end of fiscal 2013 11month the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to cash provided by operations and cash from the sale of best buy europe and mindshift partially offset by cash used for capital expenditures and the payment of dividends working capital the excess of current assets over current liabilities was 30 billion at the end of fiscal 2014 12month an increase from 12 billion at the end of fiscal 2013 11month operating cash flow decreased 360 million to 11 billion in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month and capital expenditures decreased 158 million compared to the prioryear period 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years and fiscal 2012 11month recast  in millions 



operating activities 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month was primarily due to increased cash outflows for accounts payable partially offset by improved inventory management and increased cash inflow from receivables 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2013 11month compared to fiscal 2012 11month recast was primarily due to lower gross profit in fiscal 2013 11month and larger cash payments for employee termination benefits and facility closure costs additionally in fiscal 2012 11month recast there were larger cash inflows from the normalization of accounts payable following unusually low balances at the end of fiscal 2011 due to the timing of merchandise receipts in the fourth quarter these items were partially offset by an aggressive inventory reduction plan and other working capital and cash flow management initiatives implemented towards the end of fiscal 2013 11month 

investing activities 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month was primarily due to lower capital expenditures and proceeds from the disposition of mindshift partially offset by purchases of shortterm investments in fiscal 2014 12month 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2013 11month compared to fiscal 2012 11month recast was primarily due to a reduction in cash used for acquisitions of businesses in fiscal 2013 11month offset partially by a decrease in cash received from the sale of investments 

financing activities 

the increase in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2014 12month compared to fiscal 2013 11month was primarily due to increased borrowing increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily from the exercise of employee stock options and the lack of share repurchases in fiscal 2014 12month 

the decrease in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2013 11month compared to fiscal 2012 11month recast was primarily due to the stock repurchase program being suspended in fiscal 2013 11month and the absence of the mobile buyout payment which was incurred in fiscal 2012 11month recast partially offset by the inflow of cash from the issuance of the 10 billion of longterm debt securities in fiscal 2012 11month recast 

sources of liquidity 

funds generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities are our most significant sources of liquidity we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations and to finance anticipated capital investments and strategic initiatives however in the event our liquidity is insufficient we may be required to limit our spending there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facilities or obtain additional financing if necessary on favorable terms 

we have a 500 million 364day senior unsecured revolving credit facility the 364day facility agreement and a 15 billion fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility the fiveyear facility agreement collectively the agreements with a syndicate of banks the 364day facility agreement expires in june 2014 and the fiveyear facility agreement expires in october 2016 at march 24 2014  we had no borrowings outstanding under the agreements 

we have 162 million  available based on the exchange rates in effect as of the end of fiscal 2014 12month under unsecured revolving demand facilities related to our international segment operations there were no borrowings outstanding at february 1 2014 refer to note 7 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our credit facilities 

our ability to access our revolving credit facilities under the agreements is subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of such facilities including financial covenants the financial covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios at february 1 2014 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants if an event of default were to occur with respect to any of our other debt it would likely constitute an event of default under our facilities as well 

an interest coverage ratio represents the ratio of pretax earnings before fixed charges interest expense and the interest portion of rent expense to fixed charges our interest coverage ratio calculated as reported in exhibit no 121 of this annual report on form 10k was 386 and 045 in fiscal 2014 12month and 2013 11month respectively 

  

our credit ratings and outlooks at march 24 2014  are summarized below on september 4 2013 fitch ratings ltd fitch reaffirmed its bb longterm credit rating and changed its outlook from negative to stable on august 21 2013 standard  poors ratings services “standard  poors reaffirmed its bb longterm credit rating and changed its outlook from negative to stable on may 28 2013 moodys investors service inc moodys reaffirmed its baa2 longterm credit rating and changed its outlook from developing to negative 



  

credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and therefore the credit rating assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time accordingly we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above factors that can affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance the economic environment conditions in the retail and consumer electronics industries our financial position and changes in our business strategy if further changes in our credit ratings were to occur they could impact among other things interest costs for certain of our credit facilities our future borrowing costs access to capital markets vendor financing terms and future newstore leasing costs 

  

restricted cash 

  

our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral or restricted to use for vendor payables general liability insurance workers compensation insurance and customer warranty and insurance programs restricted cash and cash equivalents which are included in other current assets were 308 million and 363 million at february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  respectively the decrease in restricted cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the sale of our 50 interest in best buy europe 

  

capital expenditures 

  

our capital expenditures typically include investments in new stores store remodeling store relocations and expansions distribution facilities and information technology enhancements during fiscal 2014 12month we invested 487 million excluding best buy europe in property and equipment primarily related to upgrading our information technology systems and capabilities and storerelated projects 

  

the following table presents our capital expenditures for each of the past three fiscal years and fiscal 2012 11month recast  in millions

refer to note 13 contingencies and commitments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information regarding our significant commitments for capital expenditures at february 1 2014  

debt and capital 

we have 350 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2016 the “2016 notes” 500 million principal amount of notes due august 2 2018 the “2018 notes” and 650 million principal amount of notes due march 15 2021 the “2021 notes” refer to note 7 debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k for further information about our 2016 notes 2018 notes and 2021 notes 

other 

at february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 we had 95 million  and 122 million  respectively outstanding under financing lease obligations 

share repurchases and dividends 

from time to time we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board we may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons such as acquiring shares to offset dilution related to equitybased incentives including stock options and our employee stock purchase plan and optimizing our capital structure we consider several factors in determining whether to make share repurchases including among other things our cash needs the availability of funding our future business plans and the market price of our stock if we decide to make future share repurchases we expect that cash provided by future operating activities as well as available cash and cash equivalents will be the sources of funding for our share repurchase program 

in fiscal 2014  12month we did not repurchase or retire any shares we repurchased and retired 63 million  shares at a cost of 122 million  in fiscal 2013  11month in fiscal 2012 12month we repurchased and retired 546 million  shares at a cost of 15 billion  at the end of fiscal 2014  12month 40 billion  of the 50 billion  share repurchase program authorized by our board in june 2011 was available for future share repurchases repurchased shares have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares 

in fiscal 2004 our board initiated the payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock a quarterly cash dividend has been paid in each subsequent quarter the payment of cash dividends is subject to customary legal and contractual restrictions during fiscal 2014 12month we made four cash dividend payments totaling 068 per share or 233 million in the aggregate 

other financial measures 

our debt to earnings ratio was 24 as of february 1 2014 compared to 63 as of february 2 2013 due primarily to net earnings in the 12 months ended february 1 2014 compared to a net loss in the comparable period ended february 2 2013 our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio which includes capitalized operating lease obligations in its calculation was 33 and 29 as of february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 respectively the ratio increased as a decrease in ebitdar was only partially offset by a decrease in capitalized operating lease obligations 

our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for the most directly comparable ratio determined in accordance gaap we have included this information in our mda as we view the adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio as an important indicator of our creditworthiness furthermore we believe that our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is important for understanding our financial position and provides meaningful additional information about our ability to service our longterm debt and other fixed obligations and to fund our future growth we also believe our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is relevant because it enables investors to compare our indebtedness to that of retailers who own rather than lease their stores our decision to own or lease real estate is based on an assessment of our financial liquidity our capital structure our desire to own or to lease the location the owner’s desire to own or to lease the location and the alternative that results in the highest return to our shareholders 

  

our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is calculated as follows 

  



  

the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio is our debt to net earnings ratio which excludes capitalized operating lease obligations from debt in the numerator of the calculation and does not adjust net earnings in the denominator of the calculation 

the following table presents a reconciliation of our debt to net earnings ratio to our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio  in millions 



 

offbalancesheet arrangements and contractual obligations 

other than operating leases we do not have any offbalancesheet financing a summary of our operating lease obligations by fiscal year is included in the contractual obligations table below additional information regarding our operating leases is available in item 2 properties  and note 9 leases  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k 

the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations by fiscal year  in millions 



note for additional information refer to note 7   debt  note 9   leases  note 11   income taxes   and note 13   contingencies and commitments  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8   financial statements and supplementary data   of this annual report on form 10k 

 

additionally we have 22 billion  in undrawn capacity on our credit facilities at february 1 2014  which if drawn upon would be included as shortterm debt in our consolidated balance sheets 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap in connection with the preparation of our financial statements we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue expenses and the related disclosures we base our assumptions estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis we review the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k we believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and they require our most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain we have reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board 

except where noted we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies for the areas described below 

inventory 

we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market through the establishment of markdown and inventory loss adjustments markdown adjustments reflect the excess of the cost over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other 

disposal of the inventory and establish a new cost basis subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdowns or an increase in that newly established cost basis markdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging forecast consumer demand the promotional environment and technological obsolescence 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our markdowns however if estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our markdown reserve percentage at february 1 2014 would have affected net earnings by approximately 7 million in fiscal 2014 

inventory loss adjustments reflect anticipated physical inventory losses eg theft that have occurred since the last physical inventory based on a percentage of net sales inventory loss adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors including historical results expectations of future inventory loss and current inventory loss trends our inventory loss estimate is verified by ongoing physical inventory counts historically our annual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory loss adjustment however if our estimates regarding physical inventory losses are inaccurate we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our physical inventory loss percentage at february 1 2014 would have affected net earnings by approximately 6 million in fiscal 2014 

vendor allowances 

we receive allowances from certain vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements intended to offset our costs of promoting and selling merchandise inventories receiptbased funds represent one form of our vendor allowances receiptbased funds are generally determined at an agreed percentage of purchases and are initially deferred and recorded as a reduction of merchandise inventories the deferred amounts are then included as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the related product is sold we estimate the amount of vendor funding to be deferred and recorded as a reduction of inventory at the end of each period based on detailed analysis of inventory turns and applicable vendor funding rates 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our vendor funding deferral however if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used we may be exposed to additional adjustments that could materially either positively or negatively impact our gross profit rate and inventory a 10 difference in our vendor funding deferral at february 1 2014 would have affected net earnings by approximately 17 million in fiscal 2014 

longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

when evaluating longlived assets for potential impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges if the sum of the estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset we calculate an impairment loss the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated fair value which may be based on estimated discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the assets carrying value exceeds the assets estimated fair value if we recognize an impairment loss the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis for a depreciable longlived asset the new cost basis will be depreciated over the remaining useful life of that asset 

when reviewing longlived assets for impairment we group longlived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities for longlived assets deployed at store locations we review for impairment at the individual store level these reviews involve comparing the carrying value of all land buildings leasehold improvements fixtures and equipment located at each store to the net cash flow projections for each store in addition we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate for example a shared asset such as a distribution center would be evaluated by reference to the aggregate assets liabilities and projected cash flows of all areas of the businesses utilizing those shared assets 

our impairment loss calculations include uncertainty because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values including estimating useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to losses that could be material we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate longlived asset impairment losses 

goodwill 

we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 

we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level which is one level below the operating segment level our detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds carrying value then it is concluded that no goodwill impairment has occurred if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination then the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value 

our detailed impairment analysis involves the use of discounted cash flow models significant management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit critical assumptions include projected comparable store sales growth store count gross profit rates sga rates working capital fluctuations capital expenditures discount rates and terminal growth rates we determine discount rates separately for each reporting unit using the capital asset pricing model we also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our companys market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations 

the carrying value of goodwill at february 1 2014 was 425 million which all related to our us reporting unit in fiscal 2014 we determined that the excess of fair value over carrying value was substantial we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 

tax contingencies 

our income tax returns like those of most companies are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions at any one time multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions we may record a liability for such exposures a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and fully resolved or clarified we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 

our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 

our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures the level of earnings and the results of tax audits 

although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax 

rate in the period of resolution a favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income tax rate and would be recognized in the period of resolution 

revenue recognition 

the following accounting estimates relating to revenue recognition contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the effects of future events 

we sell gift cards to customers in our retail stores through our websites and through selected third parties a liability is initially established for the value of the gift card we recognize revenue from gift cards when i the card is redeemed by the customer or ii the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed by the customer is remote “gift card breakage” we determine our gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns which show that after 24 months we can determine the portion of the liability for which redemption is remote 

we have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed or when using our cobranded credit cards in the us and canada points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases the value of points earned by our loyalty program members is included in accrued liabilities and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time the points are earned based on the value of points that are projected to be redeemed 

our estimate of the amount and timing of redemptions of gift cards and certificates is based primarily on historical transaction experience and our estimate of the services consumed under service contracts is based on historical usage rates we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue for our gift cards customer loyalty programs or service contracts however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

a 10 change in our gift card breakage rate at february 1 2014 would have affected net earnings by approximately 25 million in fiscal 2014 

a 10 change in our customer loyalty program redemption rate at february 1 2014 would have affected net earnings by approximately 12 million in fiscal 2014 

we also sell service contracts for technical support maintenance and other programs revenue on service contracts is deferred at the time of purchase and recognized either i ratably over the term of the contract or ii under a utilization model based on the percentage of services consumed during the contract term compared with the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract 

a 10 change in our deferred revenue balance related to service contracts at february 1 2014 would have affected net earnings by approximately 9 million in fiscal 2014 

costs associated with vacant leased property 

from timetotime we vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease for vacated locations with remaining lease commitments we record an expense for the difference between the present value of our future lease payments and related costs eg real estate taxes and common area maintenance from the date we cease to use the location through the end of the remaining lease term net of expected future sublease rental income 

our estimate of future cash flows is based on historical experience our analysis of the specific real estate market including input from independent real estate firms and economic conditions cash flows are discounted using a riskfree interest rate that coincides with the remaining lease term 

the liability recorded for location closures involves uncertainty because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods the amount and timing of future settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income when making these assumptions management considers a number of factors including historical experience the location and condition of the property the terms of the underlying lease the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our closed location liability however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

a 10 change in our closed location liability at february 1 2014 would have affected net earnings by approximately 8 million in fiscal 2014 

stockbased compensation 

we have a stockbased compensation plan which includes nonqualified stock options nonvested share awards and an employee stock purchase plan we determine the fair value of our nonqualified stock option awards using optionpricing models we determine the fair value of nonvested share awards with market conditions using montecarlo simulation we determine the fair value of nonvested share awards that vest based upon performance or time conditions at the closing market price of our stock reduced by the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period where the recipient has no dividend rights compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest managements key assumptions are developed with input from independent thirdparty valuation advisors 

valuation techniques used require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price expected dividend yield future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors and correlations between our returns and peer company returns changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 

estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment for the amounts that will be forfeited due to failure to fulfill service conditions or to achieve company or personal performance goals to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised changes in estimates can materially affect compensation expense within individual periods 

estimates and assumptions are based upon information currently available including historical experience and current business and economic conditions however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in stockbased compensation expense that could be material a 10 change in our stockbased compensation expense for the year ended february 1 2014 would have affected net earnings by approximately 6 million in fiscal 2014 

selfinsured liabilities 

we are selfinsured for certain losses related to health workers compensation and general liability claims as well as customer warranty and insurance programs although we obtain thirdparty insurance coverage to limit our exposure to these claims when estimating our selfinsured liabilities we consider a number of factors including historical claims experience demographic factors severity factors and valuations provided by independent thirdparty actuaries our selfinsured liabilities involve uncertainty because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 

we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our selfinsured liabilities however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material a 10 change in our selfinsured liabilities at february 1 2014 would have affected net earnings by approximately 5 million in fiscal 2014 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in our operations we are exposed to certain market risks 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our international segment operations on a limited basis we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure to certain forecast inventory purchases and recognized receivable and payable balances our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of net earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates our foreign currency risk management strategy includes derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments which generally have terms of up to 12 months the aggregate notional amount related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  was 157 million  and 173 million respectively the fair value recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at february 1 2014  and february 2 2013  was 3 million and 1 million respectively the amount recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings related to all contracts settled and outstanding was a gain of 4 million in fiscal 2014  12month and a gain of 1 million in fiscal 2013  11month 

the strength of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar since the end of fiscal 2013 11month had a negative overall impact on our revenue and earnings as the canadian dollar translated into fewer us dollars the negative impact on revenue from the canadian dollar depreciation was partially offset by a positive impact from the appreciation of the chinese yuan and mexican peso we estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on our revenue in fiscal 2014  12month of approximately 159 million and a net unfavorable impact on earnings of 6 million  in fiscal 2013 11month the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had a favorable impact on our revenue of approximately 28 million and an unfavorable impact on earnings of 16 million
